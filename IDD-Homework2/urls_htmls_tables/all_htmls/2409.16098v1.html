<p class="ltx_p" id="Sx1.p1.1">Mobile health has the potential to revolutionize health care delivery and patient engagement. In this work, we discuss how integrating Artificial Intelligence into digital health applications–focused on supply chain, patient management, and capacity building, among other use cases–can improve the health system and public health performance. We present an Artificial Intelligence and Reinforcement Learning platform that allows the delivery of adaptive interventions whose impact can be optimized through experimentation and real-time monitoring. The system can integrate multiple data sources and digital health applications. The flexibility of this platform to connect to various mobile health applications and digital devices and send personalized recommendations based on past data and predictions can significantly improve the impact of digital tools on health system outcomes. The potential for resource-poor settings, where the impact of this approach on health outcomes could be more decisive, is discussed specifically. This framework is, however, similarly applicable to improving efficiency in health systems where scarcity is not an issue.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p2.1">Accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the global health care sector is experiencing rapid growth in the use of digital health tools as promising solutions to persistent challenges encountered by patients, caregivers, and suppliers. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep"><sup class="ltx_sup"><a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.16098v1#bib.bib7" title="">7</a></sup></cite> As part of the impetus towards Universal Health Coverage (UHC), the World Health Organization has recognized health worker decision support and targeted provider and patient communication via mobile applications as part of a set of prioritized digital interventions for health system strengthening. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep"><sup class="ltx_sup"><a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.16098v1#bib.bib8" title="">8</a></sup></cite> These platforms can support communication, management of patients and chronic conditions, self-reporting, adherence support, access to medical knowledge bases and pharmaceutical catalogs, capacity building and procurement of drugs and medical supplies, and inventory and distribution management.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p3.1">In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool in health care, capable of utilizing data for decision-making and personalized interventions. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep"><sup class="ltx_sup"><a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.16098v1#bib.bib9" title="">9</a></sup>; <sup class="ltx_sup"><a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.16098v1#bib.bib10" title="">10</a></sup>; <sup class="ltx_sup"><a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.16098v1#bib.bib11" title="">11</a></sup>; <sup class="ltx_sup"><a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.16098v1#bib.bib12" title="">12</a></sup></cite> AI systems can use adequately tracked data from digital health platforms to offer insights, predictions, and recommendations into patient and provider behaviors, health care quality, and demand, facilitating the development of adaptive interventions delivered through digital tools. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep"><sup class="ltx_sup"><a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.16098v1#bib.bib13" title="">13</a></sup>; <sup class="ltx_sup"><a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.16098v1#bib.bib14" title="">14</a></sup>; <sup class="ltx_sup"><a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.16098v1#bib.bib15" title="">15</a></sup>; <sup class="ltx_sup"><a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.16098v1#bib.bib16" title="">16</a></sup>; <sup class="ltx_sup"><a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.16098v1#bib.bib17" title="">17</a></sup></cite> AI-enhanced adaptive interventions are not only tailored but also continuously evolve, adapting in real-time to each user’s unique choices and circumstances, thereby determining the content and timing of interventions, and identifying individuals who may need additional support. Furthermore, AI can be used to anticipate medication demand variations to help in inventory management. Enabling prediction-based timely reminders and guidance systems can promote consistent availability of vital supplies across all distribution channels. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep"><sup class="ltx_sup"><a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.16098v1#bib.bib18" title="">18</a></sup></cite></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p4">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p4.1">AI can also be used to harmonically combine and reconcile information from multiple sources, including the variety of digital tools described in the previous paragraphs, which contain rich information on the health care system’s status, functioning, and efficiency at different levels. By merging these and others into a holistic picture, evidence-based decision-making can be facilitated, giving rise to a framework that policymakers can use to systematically explore, understand, and quantify the real or potential impact of different (current or planned) public health strategies and health system policies. AI technologies can also be used in experimental designs for robust risk-minimizing public policy evaluation.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p6.1">This paper presents an AI platform designed to generate personalized predictions, recommendations, and insights by harnessing and analyzing data from digital health tools and other relevant sources. The platform provides the capability to create, test, and deploy adaptive interventions driven by Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enable optimized user engagement, resource allocation recommendations, and clinical and behavioral guidance for users. These capabilities are possible through the platform’s integration with existing digital tools designed to support patients, medical facilities, pharmacists, Community Health Workers (CHWs), midwives, and distributors of drugs and medical consumables, enhancing their operational efficacy. This paper is intended for a public health audience. While references are provided for the interested technical reader, it deliberately avoids delving into the technicalities and specificities of the AI and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and methods utilized by the platform, prioritizing instead a focus on the practical benefits and outcomes relevant to the public health context.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p7">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p7.1">While the discussion is framed specifically around the impact on health systems in LMICs, the same approach would benefit health systems in HICs by driving efficiency and better health outcomes. While the use of AI for certain use cases is more widespread in these contexts, an integrated approach that would unleash the full potential of this framework is yet not in place for even the most resourceful health systems.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S3.SS1.p1.1">The primary aim of our platform is to integrate vast data sets (maximizing their quality, proper format, and label) from digital tools, including behavioral, clinical, and contextual data, to provide valuable insights to stakeholders and create, test, and deploy personalized interventions such as nudges, recommendations, and in-app personalized content. The platform ensures that acquired data are well organized and ready for ML predictive models. This emphasis on data collection and the use of <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.1">opinionated</span> data schemas is at the core of the platform functionality.</p>

Each component is essential, ensuring users can seamlessly access, analyze, and manage their data and deploy ML models and real-time interventions. Below, we provide additional details for each of these three components.</p>

The platform creates a robust data structure that logs user events on digital health devices (e.g., mobile apps), classifying them into dynamic and static traits. The backend system analyzes and processes these traits for statistical learning and machine learning predictions and to generate adaptive interventions based on reinforcement learning algorithms. User reactions to interventions are recorded via digital health devices and tracked through the same system to feed back into the reinforcement learning algorithms.</figcaption>

Users can perform behavioral and clinical data analysis, statistical modeling, and create cohorts of users. Furthermore, the interface enables designing, testing, and deploying interventions such as nudges and rewards. It guides the user from the subject cohort (FHCWs, facilities, pharmacists, etc.) to analyze past behavior, predict future or target interventions, and sample definition through algorithm selection to feature selection and target specification, including nudge alternatives in the case of interventions. The dashboard illustrates various traits, predictions, and metrics in an intuitive format for a clear interpretation of the results and impact of the interventions.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S3.SS1.p4.1">The <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="S3.SS1.p4.1.1">backend</em> is the platform’s core, allowing the organization of data and the implementation of ML models and adaptive interventions. Data is collected and organized using domain-specific data schemas optimized for ML model implementation. Data security and privacy are key aspects captured in the backend. This standardized design of event logging enables the platform to be a uniform interface for transformation and aggregation across different application domains, e.g., supply chain and e-commerce marketplace, medication tracking, and patient communication. Finally, the backend hosts the predictive modeling engine that handles the ML component and the algorithmic decision-making service. These modules configure, train, host, and manage models for time series forecasting, deep and ensemble survival analysis, and sequential decisions via reinforcement learning.</p>

This SDK is a lightweight software embedded into mobile apps, so data is tracked directly from the source. The software is optimized for the variety of mobile devices used in LMICs, such as budget smartphones and tablets, minimizing the impact of platform integration on mobile tool performance. This SDK provides the tools for collecting relevant events and the messaging service that delivers the interventions. The tool does not collect Personal Identifiable Information (PII), complies with GDPR and HIPAA, and only tracks user actions as time-series data and contextual information such as details about the drugs being prescribed, viewed, or purchased. For interventions, the SDK is responsible for presenting these nudges to the mobile app user and automatically logging their reaction (e.g., if they opened, viewed, discarded, or blocked the nudge), ensuring complete visibility of the intervention lifecycle.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S3.SS1.p6">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S3.SS1.p6.1">The SDK uses a functionality-specific opinionated data model for data collection. This model is optimized for data science and machine learning purposes and ensures stringent control over the incoming content and quality. The goal is to make sure everything needed to tackle the relevant use cases for each functionality is recorded in exactly the way it is needed while no redundant or unnecessary information is tracked in order to work without compromising app performance, even with limited connectivity, reduce storage needs, and most importantly, keep the operational data pipelines as simple and less prone to error as possible. The SDK is also responsible for maintaining interaction logs in offline settings and autonomously managing the network layer to ensure logs are synchronized with the Causal Foundry Platform as soon as the device regains connectivity. This functionality alleviates the need for app developers to implement networking capabilities for offline usage and supports healthcare workers by eliminating the necessity of manually opening the app to sync data. The modular nature (i.e., with different components for different functionalities) and generality of the SDK allow for integration with a wide variety of existing tools, while the rigidity of its data model eases comparability across applications and cross-compatibility of models and interventions developed.</p>

The tool allows us to detect any health issue the women and their newborns might have and provide them with relevant health advice (such as recommendations on when to seek care from a health provider). Of course, the impact of this patient engagement tool hinges on women using the tool. However, we know user engagement is challenging to maintain. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep"><sup class="ltx_sup"><a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.16098v1#bib.bib69" title="">69</a></sup></cite></p>

Both fully randomized and adaptive designs are available. One remark is that adaptive experiments do not need to stop. In randomized trials, such as A/B testing, the researcher pauses the experiment, measures which treatment is statistically significantly better than others, and decides accordingly. In adaptive studies (like the one described in the example above), it is possible to run them indefinitely, making them select the best-responding treatment.

The plot shows the daily mean difference in the weekly purchased variety (the number of different health products ordered in the previous seven days), and the shaded confidence intervals are related to hypothesis testing to establish differences in means. The bar plots show the number of messages interacted with daily. Even if the sample sizes were small, the intervention had a significant (95%) positive impact during the first two weeks, with pharmacies receiving the recommendations purchasing, on average, five more different health products than those that didn’t. It also shows indications of a minor positive effect later (impact of the recommendation days and even weeks after receiving the message) and fatigue (decreasing impact of the recommendations as the novelty disappears, leading eventually to adverse effects if the frequency of notifications is too high).

For example, for interventions designed for facility health workers, in which interaction between participants from the same site is expected to create cross-contamination, the platform allows cluster randomization (i.e., the assignment to either treatment or control to all participants of the same facility). It also allows pairwise matching, an assignment mechanism typically used to achieve sample balance, notably in combination with cluster randomization, as it alleviates the need to increase sample sizes (to achieve the same statistical power) due to intracluster correlation. In this case, the underlying idea is to select pairs of facilities that share characteristics that we hypothesize will impact the outcome of interest and assign one to control and one to treatment arms for comparison. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep"><sup class="ltx_sup"><a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.16098v1#bib.bib77" title="">77</a></sup>; <sup class="ltx_sup"><a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.16098v1#bib.bib78" title="">78</a></sup>; <sup class="ltx_sup"><a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.16098v1#bib.bib79" title="">79</a></sup></cite></p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S3.SS5.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S3.SS5.p1.1">The AI platform described in this paper is currently (as of June 2024) fully operational, integrated with close to ten digital tools, and growing.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S3.SS5.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S3.SS5.p2.1">Causal Foundry’s open source SDK includes modules to track data from patient management, capacity building, e-commerce, supply chain, and condition management (patient self-tracking) tools. The core module takes care of the activity common across all types of applications. The module- (and to a large extent use-case-) specific data pipelines create hundreds of indicators at the user, HW, facility, patient, drug, or medical supply level that can be visualized in the platform and used throughout it for cohort creation, as features for ML models and for intervention.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S3.SS5.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S3.SS5.p3.1">Four classes of ML models can be easily defined, trained, deployed, and monitored through the platform: five time-to-event prediction algorithms, neural embedding-based item recommendation, ten contextual bandit algorithms for adaptive personalization and experimentation, and three restless bandit algorithms specifically well suited for optimal and equitable resource allocation. The platform’s adaptive intervention capabilities have already been tested with multiple interventions, many of which have had a significant positive impact, and many others are already planned for the immediate and near future.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S3.SS5.p4">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S3.SS5.p4.1">The platform also includes an Assistant that uses the generative models described in Section <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.16098v1#S4" title="4. Generative AI ‣ The Digital Transformation in Health: How AI Can Improve the Performance of Health Systems"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. It allows platform users to query all the information available through visualization throughout the platform conversationally. It can provide, for example, replies in plain English to questions such as: What were the ten facilities with a higher patient-to-practitioner ratio last week in Lagos? or how many units of antimalarials are available at pharmacy X?</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S3.SS5.p5">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S3.SS5.p5.1">The platform is under constant improvement, with its development being use-case-guided. Causal Foundry works closely with its partners to understand their greatest challenges and where there is a greater potential for impact of AI technologies. The prioritization of new functionalities to include is also guided by the potential to generalize across use cases, tools, and contexts. Over the next months and years, additional RL-based intervention capabilities, statistical tools for intervention and observation analysis, predictive and recommendation models, and visualizations will be deployed to facilitate meaningful exploration of all available information.</p>

Once trained, the model can generate coherent, contextually relevant, and grammatically correct texts, answer questions, and perform text-based tasks. LLMs can revolutionize how health care workers interact with information systems, enabling more efficient access to medical data and supporting decision-making. Integrating LLMs in frontline health workers’ mobile applications can leverage the benefits of a chat-based interface to facilitate user interaction and access to information more easily. Within the proposed framework, chatbots are integrated into the AI platform to employ LLM-based functionalities, as is depicted in Figure <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.16098v1#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 4.

<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.p2.1">The product aims to empower CHWs, midwives, pharmacists, and clinicians by providing insights from their data related to their practices or patients. The LLMs are pre-trained with internal data and predictions based on mobile application usage, which are stored and organized by the AI platform. Frontline health workers can access the chatbot embedded in their digital tools to obtain answers to questions about the past or future to help their supply ordering and patient management. Some examples of questions would be: Which patients haven’t I visited for over three months? Who have I referred to clinical practice in the past two months? How many HIV RDTs should I order for the next four weeks?</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S4.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.p3.1">LLMs can also be integrated into the SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan) framework to create a tool that will assist health care workers in their daily patient interactions. The tool records and summarizes provider-client interactions, converting audio to structured data, sending next-step reminders, streamlining data collection, and reducing manual data entry to enable more focused patient interactions. Workers can review session details, read audio transcripts, and add insights anytime. GAI-generated personalized care plans and medication recommendations can combine patient-specific data with evidence-based guidelines.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S4.p4">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.p4.1">Moreover, trained on specialized datasets, GAI and LLMs aid patients and pharmacists by providing comprehensive information about available drugs, their possible side effects, and interactions. In health-tracking and medication procurement apps, LLMs help patients make informed treatment decisions regarding non-prescription or over-the-counter medicines by offering insights into potential side effects and interactions, allowing them to explore detailed information about their prescribed drugs or find suitable alternatives.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.p1.1">In the transformative realm of digital health care, artificial intelligence (AI) offers notable prospects like enhanced decision-making support and more efficient patient care while posing ethical challenges, particularly around equitable health care resource access, patient privacy, and data security. Addressing these and bias prevention, fairness, and reliability are pivotal, and efforts to establish frameworks and guidelines are ongoing. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep"><sup class="ltx_sup"><a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.16098v1#bib.bib108" title="">108</a></sup>; <sup class="ltx_sup"><a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.16098v1#bib.bib109" title="">109</a></sup>; <sup class="ltx_sup"><a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.16098v1#bib.bib110" title="">110</a></sup>; <sup class="ltx_sup"><a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.16098v1#bib.bib111" title="">111</a></sup>; <sup class="ltx_sup"><a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.16098v1#bib.bib112" title="">112</a></sup></cite></p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.p2.1">The lag between AI technological advancements and developing adequate regulatory and ethical understanding frameworks is evident. Achieving AI tailored to societal needs necessitates development and deployment guided by transparency, accountability, and most importantly, stakeholder engagement. The voices of essential participants in these discussions, ranging from patient groups and community leaders to national health care authorities, are crucial in shaping the ethical landscape of AI in healthcare.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.p3.1">Concerning <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="S5.p3.1.1">privacy and data protection</em>, adherence to regulatory standards like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is imperative. These standards ensure that data, such as health worker and patient information, is anonymized and devoid of direct identifiers, providing a strong layer of protection. Additionally, mechanisms should facilitate user data deletion requests and accommodate different sensitivities of data through varied anonymization levels. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep"><sup class="ltx_sup"><a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.16098v1#bib.bib113" title="">113</a></sup>; <sup class="ltx_sup"><a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.16098v1#bib.bib92" title="">92</a></sup>; <sup class="ltx_sup"><a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.16098v1#bib.bib93" title="">93</a></sup></cite></p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.p4.1">Ensuring machine learning models are reliable and safe involves scrutinizing performance, understanding biases, and guaranteeing reasonable accuracy for the intended use and target demographics. Strategies like pursuing representative datasets and implementing bias mitigation strategies are essential to ensure fairness and accuracy in model recommendations.

<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.p5.1">Facilitating experimentation with various intervention strategies is crucial. It allows systematic testing of algorithmic-based feature impacts in real-world scenarios, including exploring effects among diverse social groups. Although the system leans on data and models for user support, the ultimate decision-maker remains the human-in-the-loop, with user feedback and validation integral to enhancing recommendation accuracy and fairness.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.p6">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.p6.1">The ethical concerns discussed so far, while particularly poignant for health care applications due to their high stakes, apply to any AI system. From a health systems perspective, additional considerations are needed around the use of these technologies by stakeholders who might have some interests in conflict with public health advancement. For example, pharmacies could exploit these technologies to increase their profits by selling more antimalarials or antibiotics, even when not required, contravening patient welfare and public health interest. While AI might exacerbate their danger, it does not lie at the origin of these pre-existing challenges. However, technology equips us with the only means to counter them: transparency and systematic supervision. Digitalization creates the necessary data trails to audit when certain operations could damage public health interests. Regulatory frameworks and the right incentives must be in place to ensure supervisory bodies have access to these data and the appropriate tools (such as the platform proposed in this work) to extract meaning from it and enable them to use a variety of positive and negative incentives to nudge behavior towards collective interest.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.p7">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.p7.1">The development and deployment of AI in health care needs clear ethical guidelines that stringently address principles such as privacy, reliability, fairness, and user agency, underscored by transparency and accountability. Engaging all stakeholders, especially those typically underrepresented, in constructive discussions will be pivotal in shaping future directions and standards. Regulation and supervision can mitigate the aggravated risks to public health arising from the capacities AI can endow on actors whose interests don’t align with societal ones. Therefore, it is crucial that we prioritize the development of these guidelines and the engagement of all stakeholders in the process.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">6. </span>Summary and Conclusions</h2>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S6.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S6.p1.1">Pharmacies, health care facilities, and health workers are essential in accessing health care everywhere. However, in low- and middle-income countries, the fragmented ecosystems dominated by informal retailers, the circulation of substandard and falsified medicines, and the scarcity of resources do not allow providers and health care systems to perform to their optimal capabilities. Different digital tools are emerging to improve this. Such technologies include capacity-building tools, apps that provide health care workers with needed supplies (e.g., drug delivery services) or medical resources (e.g., arrangement of test appointments), tools that connect them to patients (e.g., for a remote follow-up) or physicians (e.g., to get their opinion on test results), and even apps to assist them in clinical triage and diagnosis. They bring efficiency, and users generate robust sequential data into the health care delivery model. The data generated contains rich information on the behavior of their users, preferences, biases, and needs, as well as the evolution of the demand for different supplies, medications, blood, oxygen, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S6.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S6.p2.1">While data collection and organization of the information is the key to any data-driven developments, it is in its ability to transform that data into adaptive interventions to support users in a personalized manner where its largest potential to impact health outcomes and patients’ lives is. They are adaptive in that they adapt in time and to each user’s context at that moment. Besides personalization, adaptive algorithms can be used for resource allocation to help distribute material and human means fairly and efficiently.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S6.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S6.p3.1">This work presents an operational reinforcement learning platform that uses data, predictive modeling, adaptive experimentation, and bandits to enhance mobile applications through personalized content, incentives, reminders, and recommendations, including resource allocation. The platform allows the definition of controlled trials following different experimental designs to establish the effectiveness of the interventions, including (stochastic-bandit-based) adaptive assignment.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S6.p4">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S6.p4.1">Experiments have already shown improved operational efficiency and reduced stock deficiencies by optimizing information and encouraging all actors toward better-informed decisions in inventory management and patient care.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S6.p5">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S6.p5.1">Furthermore, the framework described allows access to different levels of integrated insights about the health system to decision-makers of different capacities, including early alerts for out-of-norm events and when things are evolving differently than expected. The AI platform can be used to simulate the effect of different strategies and for policy evaluation through adaptive experimentation. It can thus play a crucial role in guiding evidence-based decision-making to drive the efficiency, effectiveness, and sustainability of health systems as a whole.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S6.p6">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S6.p6.1">While this approach’s potential impact on health outcomes, and thus criticality, might be greater in LMICs, where it is at least partially intended to compensate for resource scarcity, similar efficiency gains are expected in any setting regardless of the level of access to resources.</p>
