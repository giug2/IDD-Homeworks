<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">The usage of federated learning (FL) in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANET) has garnered significant interest in research due to the advantages of reducing transmission overhead and protecting user privacy by communicating local dataset gradients instead of raw data. However, implementing FL in VANETs faces challenges, including limited communication resources, high vehicle mobility, and the statistical diversity of data distributions. In order to tackle these issues, this paper introduces a novel framework for hierarchical federated learning (HFL) over multi-hop clustering-based VANET. The proposed method utilizes a weighted combination of the average relative speed and cosine similarity of FL model parameters as a clustering metric to consider both data diversity and high vehicle mobility. This metric ensures convergence with minimum changes in cluster heads while tackling the complexities associated with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data scenarios. Additionally, the framework includes a novel mechanism to manage seamless transitions of cluster heads (CHs), followed by transferring the most recent FL model parameter to the designated CH. Furthermore, the proposed approach considers the option of merging CHs, aiming to reduce their count and, consequently, mitigate associated overhead. Through extensive simulations, the proposed hierarchical federated learning over clustered VANET has been demonstrated to improve accuracy and convergence time significantly while maintaining an acceptable level of packet overhead compared to previously proposed clustering algorithms and non-clustered VANET.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Vehicular Ad hoc NETworks (VANETs) have recently adopted machine learning (ML) algorithms to improve the safety of transportation networks by providing a set of tools to assist the system in making more informed and data-driven decisions based on learning from sensors such as LIDAR, RADAR, vehicle cameras, and provide novel services such as location-based services, real-time traffic flow prediction and control, and autonomous driving <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. In centralized machine learning algorithms, a robust learning algorithm, typically a neural network (NN), is trained on a vast dataset acquired from the vehicles’ edge devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. The concept of federated learning (FL) was recently established to bring machine learning (ML) to the edge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, which reduces transmission overhead and preserves the privacy of the users. In FL, instead of sending local datasets to the central entity, the edge devices only communicate the gradients of the learnable parameters obtained from these local datasets. These gradients are aggregated by the central entity, which determines the model parameters, which are subsequently sent to the edge devices. This process is repeated until the learning model is fully trained <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. The main challenges of using FL algorithms are restricted communication resources of the wireless environment, vehicle mobility, and statistical heterogeneity of data distributions over the road.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The first challenge of the restricted communication resources in FL arises when the central entity cannot satisfy the concurrent requests from a massive number of vehicles, resulting in a communication bottleneck. Since the produced traffic grows linearly with the number of participating vehicles and model size, one way to address the communication bottleneck problem is a partial participation rule to reduce the number of vehicles uploading updates simultaneously <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. However, the convergence time of the FL may significantly increase with partial participation, which may not be acceptable for some applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Another way to alleviate the bottleneck problem is the usage of hierarchical FL such that clusters of vehicles train models concurrently and only the aggregate of each cluster is provided by the cluster head to the central entity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Cluster formation in FL has been formulated as an optimization problem with different objective functions and constraints <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> performs the clustering with the objective of maximizing the weighted sum of the FL accuracy of the cluster heads, with the constraint that the sum of training and upload time of any vehicle is less than the link lifetime, which is the duration of time where two vehicles remain connected. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> formulates the clustering problem with the objective of minimizing the cosine similarity of the client gradient updates while constraining on the maximum similarity between the updates from any two clients based on their data generating distribution. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> aims to minimize the empirical risk of the model over the data samples and parameters of the FL model while constraining the data samples in each cluster should not overlap with those of the other clusters. However, these clustering algorithms are impractical since they require collecting complete network topology and data characteristics of the nodes in a highly dynamic vehicular network.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The second challenge of handling high vehicle mobility in FL arises since network coverage, link quality, and stability fluctuate rapidly in vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, which influences the performance of FL applications regarding convergence rate and accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> considers the mobility in clustered FL by constraining that the upload time for the transmission of the model update to the cluster head is less than the time duration during which the vehicle is under the coverage of the cluster head or central entity. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> introduces route vehicles as a relay in clustered FL in the case that cluster members are out of the coverage of the cluster head. Route vehicles connect to the cluster head and a member at the same time, computing model parameters depending on the parameters provided by the member and forwarding the new aggregated model to the cluster head. However, all of these papers assume that FL learning time is shorter than cluster formation duration in their optimization problem, and no algorithm has been proposed to deal with clusters changing faster than the convergence time of the FL learning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The third challenge of handling the heterogeneity of data distributions in FL arises since the non-IID data of the nodes in the network cause slow convergence of the FL model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> and reduces model accuracy significantly when compared to centralized learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> proposes a weighted update for inner-cluster FL algorithm to give greater weight to the cluster with fewer data samples. This improves the accuracy and convergence time of the FL by incorporating the data of each vehicle into the model in a fair manner. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> provide a clustering algorithm for FL based on the similarity of their local updates such that the data of the nodes in each cluster are IID. On the other hand, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> proposes a cluster-head selection algorithm, where the node with the highest similarity of the local updates to the remaining cluster members is selected as cluster head. However, none of these papers address the slow convergence problem of non-IID data in HFL while considering the high mobility of vehicles.</p>

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposes a novel framework for hierarchical federated learning (HFL) in clustered VANETs based on the usage of a practical clustering algorithm and metrics that take into account both the mobility of the vehicles and non-IID data structure while introducing a mechanism to adapt FL to CH changes during the execution of the FL. Vehicles establish multi-hop clusters where cluster members (CMs) transmit their local gradients to the CHs. These CHs then propagate the average computed model parameter back to the cluster members and the EPC. The EPC computes the global model parameters and relays them to the CHs, thereby updating the entire system model. The multi-hop distributed clustering algorithm is employed to maximize clustering stability and minimize the convergence time of FL with minimum overhead. The proposed cluster head selection metric integrates average relative speed and cosine similarity for efficient federated learning with rapid convergence. Moreover, a mechanism to adapt FL to the CH changes in the network is incorporated by transferring the most recent learning parameters to the new CH for use as an edge node aggregator.

The first interface is for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications by using such standards as IEEE 802.11p <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> and IEEE 802.11bd for Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, standard cellular technologies, including LTE D2D <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> and 5G NR V2X <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.

CHs correspond to edge nodes that aggregate the model parameter updates collected from the CMs and send the latest updates to the EPC periodically for the general model aggregation.

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We propose a distributed multi-hop clustering algorithm for the implementation of hierarchical FL. In addition to the commonly used relative mobility measure in previous clustering algorithms designed for various applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, we use the similarity between the latest learning model parameters in FL. The relative mobility measure is a function of the average relative speed with respect to the nearby vehicles. The incorporation of relative mobility into the clustering metric aims to maximize the stability of the clusters with minimum change in CH and CM roles in the clusters. On the other hand, the similarity between the latest learning model parameters is used to mitigate the non-IID issue in FL, which causes a slow convergence in the global model learning. The proposed clustering algorithm reduces the clustering overhead by exchanging the relative speed and FL model parameters only with the neighboring nodes, establishing a direct link to a neighbor who is already a head or a member of a cluster rather than connecting to the CH over multiple hops and focusing on clustering based on both mobility and model update similarity metric to preserve the cluster structure while mitigating the probability of divergence in the FL algorithm.</p>

The reason for using the average relative speed in the selection of the CH is to achieve cluster stability such that the changes in the CHs are minimized. On the other hand, the reason for the selection of the cosine similarity between the previous and current model parameters at the same vehicle is that the similarity of the FL parameters at the same node shows the vehicle’s capability for training and how reliable the training procedure is. Moreover, this eliminates the overhead of collecting the FL parameters from the neighboring vehicles in the <math id="S3.p5.14.m9.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="SE" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.p5.14.m9.1a"><mrow id="S3.p5.14.m9.1.1" xref="S3.p5.14.m9.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.p5.14.m9.1.1.2" xref="S3.p5.14.m9.1.1.2.cmml">S</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.p5.14.m9.1.1.1" xref="S3.p5.14.m9.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S3.p5.14.m9.1.1.3" xref="S3.p5.14.m9.1.1.3.cmml">E</mi></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.p5.14.m9.1b"><apply id="S3.p5.14.m9.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.p5.14.m9.1.1"><times id="S3.p5.14.m9.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.p5.14.m9.1.1.1"></times><ci id="S3.p5.14.m9.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.p5.14.m9.1.1.2">𝑆</ci><ci id="S3.p5.14.m9.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.p5.14.m9.1.1.3">𝐸</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.p5.14.m9.1c">SE</annotation></semantics></math> state.

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We propose the usage of the HFL algorithm over the multi-hop clustered architecture, described in Section III, in contrast to the conventional FL (CFL) due to the advantages of distributed learning and computing in multiple clusters. The proposed HFL is capable of dealing with the divergence possibility in non-IID datasets and the mobility of vehicles by using both the mobility measure and the similarity between the latest learning model parameters in FL in the clustering metric. Moreover, it introduces a mechanism to adapt FL to CH changes during the execution of the FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In conventional FL, every CM constructs a local gradient vector during each communication round using its private dataset and the global model from the previous communication round. The gradients are then transmitted to the EPC through the respective CHs. At EPC, a global model is built utilizing both the received gradients and the previous communication round global model. The EPC then communicates the global model to all CMs through their connected CHs. This round of updating the global model continues until the global convergence.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In HFL, the local gradient vectors calculated at all the CMs connected to the CHs are aggregated by averaging at the CHs; CHs provide the aggregated model parameters to the EPC. The EPC then generates the global model by averaging the model parameters delivered by CHs and sends it to the CHs to update the model parameters based on the aggregated global model. The updated model parameters are finally sent to the CMs to continue the learning procedure based on the new parameters they received.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The aim of the simulations is to analyze the performance of the proposed HFL over clustered VANET algorithm for different network size and transmission range values and compare it to that of three existing approaches: Traditional FL without the usage of the clustering (No Clustering) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> HFL over previously proposed Multihop-Cluster-Based IEEE 802.11p and LTE Hybrid Architecture (VMaSC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, and HFL over previously proposed clustering algorithm for FL based on the similarity of their local updates (CVFL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. In traditional FL, clustering is not incorporated, and all vehicles are treated as clients, while an EPC is considered as the server and functions as the central server. In VMaSC, the selection of a CH for cluster formation relies solely on the average relative speed metric. On the other hand, in CVFL, the CH selection and cluster creation are determined exclusively by evaluating cosine similarity.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">During the FL training process, the vehicles utilize the well-known benchmark image classification datasets, namely MNIST <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. MNIST comprises 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits with random classes assigned to ensure non-IID data distribution. To introduce diversity, the dataset is randomly partitioned and made available to the vehicles. The dataset consists of 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples. Vehicles engage in cooperative training of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model consisting of two hidden layers, each containing 64 neurons. Additionally, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model is employed, comprising two 5 × 5 convolutional layers (10 channels in the first and 20 in the second), each followed by 2 × 2 max pooling. The CNN model also integrates two fully connected layers with 50 units and ReLU activation, culminating in a softmax output layer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
The performance metrics used to evaluate the FL are accuracy and convergence time. Accuracy is commonly measured using evaluation metrics that assess the model’s performance on a separate validation dataset, which measures the proportion of correct predictions made by the learning model when tested with samples from the dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. The convergence time refers to the duration taken for the distributed learning process to achieve a desired level of performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.</p>

The simulation involves 20 vehicles with a communication range of 100 meters. The accuracy is represented as a function of the communication round. A communication round is a distinct iteration within the training procedure wherein vehicles interface with a central server or aggregator. Within the figure, the intent is to visualize state transitions facilitated by the clustering algorithm. The variations in accuracy within CHs and EPC occur due to factors such as the introduction of new vehicles, state transitions of existing vehicles, and the merging of multiple CHs. A node’s absence in a specific communication round signifies alterations in its state to become a CM or SE or its amalgamation with another CH. Moreover, the variation in accuracy is illustrated across different CHs and the EPC.</p>

Furthermore, reducing the number of vehicles at a constant transmission range amplifies fluctuations in the global model, owing to the decreased number of clients in the system. Likewise, maintaining the same number of vehicles while increasing the transmission range intensifies fluctuations due to reduced clustering and fewer CHs; however, this scenario is smoother than the one with ten vehicles due to the higher number of vehicles. Furthermore, an increase in the number of hops for the same scenario causes an increase in the fluctuations. This can be attributed to the fact that a higher number of hops reduces the number of CHs within a cluster, leading to increased fluctuations. This trend is similar to the model with a higher transmission range, resulting in heightened fluctuations. Hence, with an increasing number of vehicles and a simultaneous reduction in transmission range, given an optimal value of <math id="S5.SS2.p2.5.m5.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\alpha" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.p2.5.m5.1a"><mi id="S5.SS2.p2.5.m5.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.p2.5.m5.1.1.cmml">α</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.p2.5.m5.1b"><ci id="S5.SS2.p2.5.m5.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p2.5.m5.1.1">𝛼</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.p2.5.m5.1c">\alpha</annotation></semantics></math>, the fluctuation in accuracy diminishes.

Additionally, reducing the number of vehicles while maintaining the same transmission range results in an increase in convergence time. This happens because fewer vehicles are available to participate in the FL process as the number of vehicles decreases, causing the learning procedure to take longer compared to scenarios with a higher density of vehicles. Similarly, retaining the same number of vehicles while increasing the transmission range leads to extended convergence time compared to the lower transmission range, yet it remains lower than the scenario with fewer vehicles. This is because a higher transmission range results in clusters with a greater number of vehicles but fewer CHs available to collect model parameters. Consequently, with more vehicles participating, it outperforms the scenario with fewer vehicles. However, due to the reduced number of CHs for gathering model parameters and fewer vehicles connecting to the EPC to engage in global model updates, the convergence time increases compared to a lower transmission range.</p>

This increased sensitivity can result in more vehicles being identified as CHs or experiencing changes in their roles within the network. This is because the system responds quickly to fluctuations in speed, leading to adjustments in the CH selection process. Consequently, this elevated CH count leads to an increased number of overhead packets dispatched to the EPC. This correspondence between the number of CHs and packet overhead showcases the relationship between the number of clusters and the associated communication costs of the LTE or 5G NR packets. As the number of CHs grows, the packet overhead increases, underscoring the system’s reliance on LTE or 5G packets for EPC communication.</p>

CVFL and VMaSC algorithms exhibit stagnation in local minima, failing to accommodate new data from emerging vehicles or adapting to vehicular and cluster dynamics changes as influenced by the clustering algorithm. In scenarios without clustering, significant fluctuations persist, even in higher communication rounds, indicating a heightened likelihood of divergence. Furthermore, when considering different numbers of hops in the network, it becomes evident that an increase in the number of hops corresponds to an increase in fluctuations. This is primarily attributed to the scenario of fewer clusters with a higher number of participating vehicles in the FL procedure. Consequently, a reduced number of CHs contribute to the model parameter and participate in the acquisition of the global model. Additionally, with an increase in the number of hops, the benchmarks display substantial variability, contrasting with our algorithm, which consistently demonstrates a trend toward higher accuracy with reduced fluctuations. Furthermore, within a fixed number of hops, as the number of vehicles increases under a constant transmission scenario, the degree of fluctuation tends to decrease. Conversely, the benchmark algorithm exhibits a susceptibility to becoming trapped in local minima or experiencing abrupt fluctuations in accuracy during extended communication rounds. In contrast, our algorithm maintains a more stable behavior with reduced fluctuations, offering improved performance and reliability in prolonged communication rounds. On the other hand, within a fixed number of hops and a constant number of vehicles, when the transmission range increases, there is a noticeable increase in the variability observed throughout the FL procedure. This heightened variation is a consequence of having a greater number of vehicles spread across fewer clusters. This phenomenon underscores the challenge faced by benchmark algorithms, which struggle to consistently achieve a high level of accuracy with stable performance under these conditions. In contrast, our algorithm demonstrates a remarkable ability to maintain a stable behavior while achieving high accuracy when compared to other methods. This capability positions our approach as a more robust and reliable solution, particularly in scenarios with a higher transmission range.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper presents a novel framework for HFL over a multi-hop cluster-based vehicular network with the goal of addressing the issues of limited communication resources at high vehicle density, high vehicle mobility, and the statistical diversity of data distributions. The proposed algorithm features a dynamic multi-hop clustering algorithm, combining average relative speed and cosine similarity metrics to ensure stable clustering and fast convergence in HFL. Additionally, the introduced framework incorporates an innovative mechanism aimed at enabling smooth transitions between cluster heads (CHs) and facilitating the transfer of the most up-to-date FL model parameter. This mechanism effectively aligns the FL procedure with the clustering algorithm. Through simulations, we have demonstrated that the proposed algorithm improves accuracy and convergence time while maintaining an acceptable level of packet overhead. This framework provides a promising solution for FL in VANETs, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of data-driven decision-making, real-time traffic prediction, and other advanced services.
In the future, we plan to work on analyzing the effect of HFL on security, incorporating vehicle selection into the HFL, and investigating the applicability of the proposed framework in traffic prediction and management, collision avoidance, autonomous driving, environmental monitoring, and emergency services applications.</p>
