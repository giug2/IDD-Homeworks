<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Automated cyber threat detection in computer networks is a major challenge in cybersecurity. The cyber domain has inherent challenges that make traditional machine learning techniques problematic, specifically the need to learn continually evolving attacks through global collaboration while maintaining data privacy, and the varying resources available to network owners. We present a scheme to mitigate these difficulties through an architectural approach using community model sharing with a streaming analytic pipeline. Our streaming approach trains models incrementally as each log record is processed, thereby adjusting to concept drift resulting from changing attacks. Further, we designed a community sharing approach which federates learning through merging models without the need to share sensitive cyber-log data. Finally, by standardizing data and Machine Learning processes in a modular way, we provide network security operators the ability to manage cyber threat events and model sensitivity through community member and analytic method weighting in ways that are best suited for their available resources and data.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Computers have been subject to malicious attacks for many years. However, the sophistication and impacts of those attacks have grown dramatically. Successful, timely detection of such attacks is essential to enable defenders to prevent or respond to an attack to mitigate or minimize damage. The consequences from such attacks include substantial financial losses, leaked personal data, and the release of proprietary information or state secrets. The immense human and computational resources required to analyze network logs is prohibitive and often still misses novel attacks. As a result, there is a growing need to incorporate advanced techniques such as machine learning in the cyber defender’s toolbox. However, the cyber domain presents key challenges to traditional batch machine learning techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Individual organizations that train models to recognize cyber threats are severely data limited, however, privacy concerns prevent them from directly sharing raw network data logs. Even anonymized data may collectively reveal sensitive information. We therefore propose a federated learning system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> where trained standardized models are shared across organizations through their parameters only without sharing any raw data. The models are then merged in a way to improve performance compared to individually trained models.

<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In order to entice a large group of organizations to participate in a collaborative learning enterprise, we lower barriers-to-entry by minimizing the computational requirements regarding platform, bandwidth, processing power, and storage. Our design choices were guided by this constraint, where we preferred small algorithms, minimal sharing, and streaming processing. Some modifications to the machine learning algorithms designed for traditional batch processing are needed to enable streaming learning.

To maintain a small model size, for our neural network model, we avoided deep learning and implemented a multilayer perceptron with five hidden layers of size [64, 32, 16, 8, 4] and output size two for the malicious and benign scores.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We presented an automated cyber threat detection system that leverages sharing communities for collaborative, federated learning with a streaming architecture. The computation DAG addresses the need for data privacy and low barriers-to-entry. We completed a prototype with streaming machine learning algorithms with the capability to merge shared models. The results from our internal testing demonstrate the feasibility of our approach and the effectiveness of sharing and merging shared models, however a detailed performance analysis is contingent on more robust labeling.</p>
