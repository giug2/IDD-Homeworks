<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text">Learning-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs) are widely deployed for defending various cyberattacks.
Existing learning-based NIDS mainly uses Neural Network (NN) as a classifier that relies on the quality and quantity of cyberattack data.
Such NN-based approaches are also hard to interpret for improving efficiency and scalability.
In this paper, we design a new local-global computation paradigm, <span id="id1.id1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FedForest</span>, a novel learning-based NIDS by combining the interpretable Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) and Federated Learning (FL) framework.
Specifically, <span id="id1.id1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FedForest</span> is composed of multiple clients that extract local cyberattack data features for the server to train models and detect intrusions.
A privacy-enhanced technology is also proposed in <span id="id1.id1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FedForest</span> to further defeat the privacy of the FL systems.
Extensive experiments on 4 cyberattack datasets of different tasks demonstrate that <span id="id1.id1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FedForest</span> is effective, efficient, interpretable, and extendable.
<span id="id1.id1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FedForest</span> ranks first in the collaborative learning and cybersecurity competition 2021 for Chinese college students.</span></p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As one of the most important infrastructures of the Internet, Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs) are designed to detect malicious behaviors or intrusions in the Internet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
As a gatekeeper for Internet devices, NIDS plays an important role in defeating cyber-attacks for enterprises, individuals, and governments on various computing systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
Nowadays, deploying the Machine Learning (ML) methods to improve the performance of NIDSs become a promising direction.
Benefiting from the extraordinary ability to extract and learn features from existing network data, these learning-based NIDSs are proved to outperform many existing NIDSs such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The current popular trend of building a learning-based NIDS is to train an anomaly detection model based on benign network traffic.
This anomaly detection model can characterize the normal behaviors of network traffic and identify intrusions by calculating the deviations from the normal behaviors.
The output of such models, such as Kitsune <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, is an anomaly score that will generate an intrusion alarm when this score exceeds a pre-set threshold.
Without requiring any known attack signatures, such systems can effectively generate alarms for various kinds of intrusions including even unknown attacks which have distinct behaviors from the normal traffic.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, such an anomaly detection-based NIDS approach still has several obvious limitations.
(1) The accuracy of these learning-based NIDS highly relies on the quality and quantity of the training data which is not suitable for the data privacy-sensitive scenarios.
(2) The output of such NIDS is just an anomaly alert but still requires human experts to analyze and identify to understand the attack category to react.
(3) Most of such NIDSs are designed based on ML models that are non-interpretable for further improvement and robustness.
(4) These NIDSs lack scalability since when dealing with different anomaly detection tasks, significant modifications on the ML models are usually required for training a new model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FedForest</span>, <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">a novel privacy-preserving, interpretable, and scalable NIDS</span>, to solve the above limitations.
First, <span id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FedForest</span> uses a Federated Learning (FL) framework to solve the data privacy issue.
A client-to-server architecture is deployed in our work to let the client share the privacy-preserving information of various kinds of network traffic data for the NIDS training on the server.
Enhanced privacy protection is given to further protect the data against the attacks like DLG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
Second, <span id="S1.p4.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FedForest</span> can classify the exact attack category for immediate reaction.
Also, our framework can support the extension for adding the unknown attacks by letting the client upload the novel attack data update the classifier with little cost.
Third, <span id="S1.p4.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FedForest</span> chooses Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) model as the core classification algorithm.
GBDT, as a tree-based ML method, is interpretable and efficient compared with the other ML-based approaches like NNs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
In the end, for scalability, <span id="S1.p4.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FedForest</span> can achieve high accuracy on different intrusion detection tasks without modifying the system architecture and model structures.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">We conduct extensive experiments for <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FedForest</span> on <math id="S1.p5.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="4" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p5.1.m1.1a"><mn id="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.cmml">4</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p5.1.m1.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1">4</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p5.1.m1.1c">4</annotation></semantics></math> cyberattack datasets for diverse cybersecurity tasks, including Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack classification task (DDoS2019 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>), DNS over HTTPS (DoH) traffic classification task (DoHBrw2020 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>), darknet classification task (Darknet2020 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>), and Android malware classification task (MalDroid2020 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>).
The results indicate that <span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FedForest</span> can achieve a high accuracy supported by the FL framework with data privacy protected.
We show that <span id="S1.p5.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FedForest</span> is interpretable which can be easily used for human experts’ intervene and for further improvement <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.
Also, <span id="S1.p5.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FedForest</span> is able to alert for unknown attacks.
In addition, <span id="S1.p5.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FedForest</span> can be efficiently trained and is scalable for providing high accuracy on these different intrusion detection tasks.</p>

<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In summary, our contributions can be summarized as follows.
(1) We propose a novel collaborative learning framework, <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FedForest</span>, by combining FL and GBDT to build high accuracy NIDS.

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we firstly present FL, including the definition and principles of horizontal and vertical FL.
Then, since most NIDSs adopt tree-based ML models and NNs as the backbone classifier for NIDSs, we provide an overview of previous works of NNs-based and tree-based NIDSs, analyze their advantages and limitations, and present our research motivation.
We conclude this section by introducing differential privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> which is widely used for enhancing privacy protection for the FL framework.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> is a distributed learning paradigm that allows training model with data of other participants without data sharing.
FL enables a model to capture more features and enhance generalization while keeping data privacy.
In practice, the FL setting comprises a server that holds a model and several clients holding the private data.
The server coordinates clients to train the model while preserving client data locality, i.e. no transfer required for the client’s private data.
Specifically, the server distributes the model to clients to train the model with their own data and collect back the updated weight.
According to the data feature distribution on clients, FL can be categorized into Horizontal FL and Vertical FL.
FL can be deployed in the scenario that data contains private information that is hard to collect and share such as the cyberattack data.
Combining NIDS with FL can let the NIDS classifier learn more cyberattack features from many parties which can help build effective learning-based NIDS.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Vertical FL, or feature-wise FL, whose architecture is shown in Figure <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 2.1 Federated Learning ‣ 2 Background ‣ An Interpretable Federated Learning-based Network Intrusion Detection Framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, is used for scenarios where clients share the same sample space.

An illustrative example can be an object detection FL training task: server trains global model with image data located on users’ smartphone.
Existing FL frameworks are mainly designed for training NNs model under horizontal FL setting, such as FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.
In FedAvg, instead of running only one SGD step, each client takes several SGD steps locally, and then sends their parameters to the server for update aggregation.
Other frameworks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> optimized local updating and gradient aggregation, resulting in higher accuracy score.
Horizontal FL can also be applied for DDoS attack detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.
The server uses the statistic data of network traffic gathered by the routers, <span id="S2.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text">i.e.</span> the FL clients, to train the NIDS classifier. In general, cyberattack data share the same feature space and differ on the sample space.

However, both of them are not considered to be scalable for other cyberattack detection tasks.
Besides, model interpretability is also decisive for security-critical applications.
On the one hand, model interpretability could help to improve the model robustness to mitigate issues like Adversarial Examples (AE) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.
On the other hand, interpreting a model could improve its performance as shown in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.
Thus, deploying a tree-based approach to build NIDS has obvious advantages over those NN-based NIDSs which are hard to include interpretability.</p>

<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The problem that we aim to solve can be described with the following description.
One cybersecurity service provider that plans to set up a NIDS for multi-class cyberattack detection as a service for his clients.
In order to achieve such a goal, the cybersecurity service provider must build a model based on the network traffic data and features collected by his clients.
However, the clients, such as small enterprises or governments, cannot directly provide this necessary network traffic data since the data privacy cannot be sacrificed.
Then, the NIDS must be able to automatically identify the cyberattack category since we assume the clients such as small enterprises or governments are lack security experts that can immediately react based on only an anomaly alarm.
Third, the NIDS must be interpretable due to the reason that interpretability can help to improve the NIDS performance in the future and potentially provide robustness.
In the end, once the NIDS is built, the cybersecurity service provider can also extend the usage of NIDS to diverse cyberattack detection tasks without too much modification on the NIDS including the system architecture and ML model structures.

<div id="S3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we aim to develop a novel learning-based NIDS for multi-class intrusion classification.
This NIDS should provide high accuracy while keeping the data locality and privacy.
Also, NIDS should also be interpretable to human experts for reaction and improvement.
Scalability should also be considered for extending the usage for other cybersecurity tasks such as Android malware detection with little modification.
Therefore, we summarize our design goals as follows.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Figure <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4 Design and Implementation ‣ An Interpretable Federated Learning-based Network Intrusion Detection Framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> illustrates the workflow to build <span id="S4.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FedForest</span>.
There are four steps between the server end (security service provider) and the clients (cyberattack data owners).
In the first step (Figure <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4 Design and Implementation ‣ An Interpretable Federated Learning-based Network Intrusion Detection Framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> (1)), the server schedules the involved clients according to the performance requirement, data feature distribution and the cost budget. Then, each selected client trains a local encoder (GBDT classifier) with their sampled private data and then uploads encoders containing the local data feature to the server.
The second step (Figure <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4 Design and Implementation ‣ An Interpretable Federated Learning-based Network Intrusion Detection Framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> (2)) is to select the most necessary encoders and distribute them to all clients.
The encoder selection on the server can further reduce the transmission and computation cost.
Thirdly, each client encodes its own data with the received encoders and sends back the encoding as well as label data to the server (Figure <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4 Design and Implementation ‣ An Interpretable Federated Learning-based Network Intrusion Detection Framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> (3)).
The encoding contains necessary features that suffice to identify the attack. As an illustrative example, we can regard data as a cylinder and the encoders as cameras of different positions. The encoding data are pictures taken from different angles.
In the last step, the server trains a global model for final predictions (Figure <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4 Design and Implementation ‣ An Interpretable Federated Learning-based Network Intrusion Detection Framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> (4)).
our method does not involve an additional change to the model implementation, which makes our approach easy to deploy and can benefit from existing highly-optimized implementations.
Overall, we leverage the idea of a partial encoder and global classifier: local features are extracted through encoders and are fed into a global classifier for final prediction.</p>

We propose to select clients in a greedy manner based on their own attack type distribution to keep each data type balanced in the training set.
Concretely, a survey of data type distribution for each participant client is conducted before the main process.
The survey includes the types of attack and the number of data samples for each type of attack on each participant client.</p>

The trained encoder is composed of a series of decision trees and each inner node of a decision tree represents a decision threshold of a feature.
Therefore, the encoder does not contain original data nor reversible information.
Furthermore, the structure of the decision tree (Figure <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 2.3 Tree-based NIDSs ‣ 2 Background ‣ An Interpretable Federated Learning-based Network Intrusion Detection Framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>) makes it possible for human experts to understand the prediction process for further improvement.
These selected clients then upload trained encoders to the server.</p>

In order to guarantee the training efficiency, we propose the following heuristic to select the encoders<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>For cases with a limited number of clients, all clients will download the encoders to maximize the performance.</span></span></span>.</p>

For example, during the encoder selection, the server selects not only encoders that cover all the classes but also encoders that contain potential zero-day attack types.

<p id="S4.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">After the server has obtained the encoding and label data, it trains the server classifier (GBDT model) for final predictions.
When deploying, the service provider needs to combine the selected encoders and the server classifier. The inference consists of two steps: the encoders firstly generate softmax probabilities as the encoding, and the server classifier then outputs final predictions using the encoding.
Thus, another advantage is that the GBDT models allow the security service provider to extract logic rules learned by the model because of the natural interpretability of the tree-based machine learning model.</p>

Bold numbers are the highest accuracy scores obtained on the datasets under the FL setting.
We can see that <span id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FedForest</span> of architecture “L+L” achieves systematically higher accuracy against MLP models under FL settings.

Another benefit of leaf-wise growth is the reduction of training complexity and model size.
Consequently, we use “L+L” as the default architecture of <span id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FedForest</span> for further analysis. As for comparison, we choose 3-layer MLP (fastest) and 7-layer MLP (most accurate) for NNs-based NIDS with FedAvg.</p>

To interpret the performance of our encoders considering the feature extraction, we choose DDoS2019 data as an example and use t-SNE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> to visualize encoding data (Figure <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 5.3.1 Quality of feature extraction ‣ 5.3 Result Analysis ‣ 5 Experimentation and Evaluation ‣ An Interpretable Federated Learning-based Network Intrusion Detection Framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> (a)), as well as data preprocessed by logarithm operation (Figure <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 5.3.1 Quality of feature extraction ‣ 5.3 Result Analysis ‣ 5 Experimentation and Evaluation ‣ An Interpretable Federated Learning-based Network Intrusion Detection Framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> (b)) and followed standarization operation (Figure <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 5.3.1 Quality of feature extraction ‣ 5.3 Result Analysis ‣ 5 Experimentation and Evaluation ‣ An Interpretable Federated Learning-based Network Intrusion Detection Framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> (c)).</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We observe that in the comparison with single logarithm operation, a followed standardization demonstrates better clustering ability for certain classes (<span id="S5.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text">e.g.</span> Class 12, blue points), while it still cannot deal with other classes (<span id="S5.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text">e.g.</span> Class 10, green points) which indicates the weakness of handcrafted preprocessing methods.
As shown in Figure <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 5.3.1 Quality of feature extraction ‣ 5.3 Result Analysis ‣ 5 Experimentation and Evaluation ‣ An Interpretable Federated Learning-based Network Intrusion Detection Framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> (a), the representation of encoding data is less divergent, signifying that encoders outperform others in clustering characteristics for all classes.
Considering the data and label noise, most samples belonging to the same class are still successfully clustered.

We observe that the total overhead of <span id="S5.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FedForest</span> is much lower than NNs when only using CPU for training.
The reduction is because of the small overhead on the client since the encoders are much smaller than the server classifier. Moreover, most importantly, they do not require updating parameters multiple times like NNs do which proves that <span id="S5.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FedForest</span> is lightweight and easy to deploy on resource-constrained devices without accelerator like GPUs.</p>

Furthermore, as mentioned in Section <a href="#S3" title="3 Problem Statement ‣ An Interpretable Federated Learning-based Network Intrusion Detection Framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, the client adds random data masking for feature data and label data before training starts, making it more difficult to fully recover the client’s data.
Consequently, except for extremely simple data and models, the attacker can not practically rebuild client data given softmax probability (encoding) and the GBDT model. Moreover, our NIDS can be implemented altogether with privacy-enhancing techniques, <span id="S5.SS3.SSS3.p2.7.2" class="ltx_text">e.g.</span> homomorphic encryption.</p>

Another benefit is that the clients do not need to transmit the masked data to the server and further reduce communication overhead.
However, the masked data may contain critical features and decrease the model’s performance.
Particularly, the masking on the feature data is more worth studying since it covers the majority of the data, <span id="S5.SS4.SSS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text">i.e.</span> feature data.

<p id="S5.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The right to be forgotten attracts increasing attention and is protected by legislations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> in Europe.
Bourtoule <span id="S5.SS5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text">et al.</span> have introduced machine unlearning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> which aims to erase the effect of data to be unlearned from a trained model.
They have also proposed SISA, a training framework that allows data to be unlearned from the model with a minimal cost.
Specifically, SISA partitions the training dataset into small parts called shards, and train one constituent model for each shard.
In this way, when some data need to be unlearned, only the model of the shard containing the data has to be retrained from the last checkpoint where the data is not introduced into the training process.</p>

<div id="S5.SS5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For the machine unlearning, <span id="S5.SS5.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FedForest</span> is designed to be similar to the SISA by regarding client data as the shards.
If some client wants to be unlearned, it only needs to delete the corresponding encoding data and retrain the server classifier.
For the client who wants to be unlearned but whose encoder has been spread to other clients during training, the server has to select another available encoder to encode client data.
Nevertheless, the major cost is still retraining the server classifier. Consequently,
<span id="S5.SS5.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FedForest</span> allows participants to freely unlearn data without exerting much influence on the server.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There are three major hyperparameters for training a GBDT model, and six hyperparameters for training <span id="S6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FedForest</span> including those for client encoders and those for the server classifier.
During our experiments, we discover that <span id="S6.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FedForest</span> is sensitive to the hyperparameters tuning especially for the server classifier.
Nevertheless, following the official parameter tuning guide of LightGBM and XGBoost, it is possible to determine a search space of common hyperparameters and adopt a grid search to find the optimal.
In this work, we use grid search over the neighborhood of default hyperparameters.
Besides grid search, there are various AutoML heuristics that can be applied for searching optimal hyperparameters, <span id="S6.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text">e.g.</span> random search <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>, bayesian hyperparameter optimization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>.
We leave these hyperparameter optimization heuristics as future work.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Another issue for building NIDS is to identify the unknown attacks. For those anomaly-based NIDS, although they can alarm when unknown attacks are launched, identification and reacting are still hard since human experts must intervene.
In this paper, we have shown that <span id="S6.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FedForest</span> has the ability to alarm when unknown attacks exist although the exact category cannot be given.
In future work, one solution is to train a group of one-vs-rest server classifiers.
Typically, to train an ensemble of one-vs-rest classifiers, the server needs to train a binary classifier for each attack, and the complexity of total training cost will be linear to the number of attack types.
In cases where there are many different attack types, a heuristic for reducing the training cost is to manually group the attacks into fewer attack categories.
Taking multi-class DDoS attack detection as an example, the SYN flood attack and UDP flood attacks belong to the exploitation attack and the other attacks are members of the reflection attack.
To reduce the attack types, it only needs to train a classifier distinguishing between exploitation attack and reflection attack.</p>
