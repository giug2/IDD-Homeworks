<h6 class="ltx_title ltx_title_abstract">Abstract</h6>
<p class="ltx_p" id="id18.id1">The rapid proliferation of Internet-of-things (IoT) as well as mobile devices such as Electric Vehicles (EVs), has led to unpredictable load at the grid. The demand to supply ratio is particularly exacerbated at a few grid aggregators (charging stations) with excessive demand due to the geographic location, peak time, etc. Existing solutions on demand response cannot achieve significant improvements based only on time-shifting the loads without considering the device properties such as charging modes and movement capabilities to enable geographic migration. Additionally, the information on the spare capacity at a few aggregators can aid in re-channeling the load from other aggregators facing excess demand to allow migration of devices. In this paper, we model these flexible properties of the devices as a mixed-integer non-linear problem (MINLP) to minimize excess load and the improve the utility (benefit) across all devices. We propose an online distributed low-complexity heuristic that prioritizes devices based on demand and deadlines to minimize the cumulative loss in utility. The proposed heuristic is tested on an exhaustive set of synthetic data and compared with solutions from a solver/optimization tool for the same runtime to show the impracticality of using a solver. A real-world EV testbed data is also tested with our proposed solution and other scheduling solutions to show the practicality of generating a feasible schedule and a loss improvement of at least 57.23%.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p1.1">The availability of various communication technologies from IoT has enabled a plethora of devices to interact with the grid for energy trading.
Scheduling demand requests from all the devices could result in outages and/or prohibitive costs due to exceeding the available peak capacity of the grid <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.14293v1#bib.bib1" title="">1</a>]</cite>. Further, the arrival of mobile devices such as Electric Vehicles (EVs) is generally not known apriori, leading to uncertainty in demand planning.
The penetration of renewables has alleviated this issue with distributed energy resources (DERs) that can supply additional energy in the form of aggregators (micro-and nano-grids). This bridges the disparity between the exponential rise in the number of EVs and the limited charging stations.
Traditional demand-response entails devices receiving power from a specific (geographically limited) grid location.
These solutions aim to maximize the devices meeting their demand while keeping the demand within the aggregator’s peak capacity.
However, with the availability of multiple aggregators, mobile devices (represented by EVs) communicate with the aggregators and move to different locations to improve the demand-side management (DSM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.14293v1#bib.bib2" title="">2</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p2.1">The primary goal of DSM is to efficiently utilize the existing grid capacity to meet the demands of the devices without any grid enhancements <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.14293v1#bib.bib3" title="">3</a>]</cite>. The demand satisfaction is based on fulfilling the energy demand within a specified time (deadline).
Existing works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.14293v1#bib.bib4" title="">4</a>]</cite> perform DSM by utilizing the day-ahead schedule such that the demand for some devices can be shifted either to an earlier or later time.
Additionally, most of the existing solutions consider only a single mode of operation (single value of energy consumption) for the energy demand of the device during scheduling.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p3.1">Most electrical devices are heterogeneous operating in multiple power modes, <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="S1.p3.1.1">e.g.,</em> a refrigerator can operate in defrost, quick freeze, etc.With mobile devices, the demand can be shifted not only in time but geographically as well.
Hence, we model the device characteristics such as multiple power modes and mobility in addition to the demand and the deadlines for DSM.
The combined model is used to maximize the utility/benefit of the devices obtained by fulfilling their demanded energy within the deadline.</p>

An aggregator interfaces with the grid and manages the demand from a set of devices as a cluster based on its maximum capacity.
Devices can turn on/arrive at any time and request their demand to the associated cluster’s aggregator.
The power supply is realized through an electrical transmission line while the communication is either through a wired or wireless channel.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p5">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p5.1">In this paper, we develop an efficient scheduling algorithm to maximize the utility of the devices and aggregators while not exceeding its peak capacity at any point.
We consider heterogeneous devices having a different power consumption profile (<em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="S1.p5.1.1">e.g.,</em> EVs, Washing machine, etc.) and various modes of operation (<em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="S1.p5.1.2">e.g.,</em> low-power mode, sleep mode, etc.).
Based on the device parameters such as requested demand, deadline, operating modes, etc., the aggregator assigns priorities to devices and schedules them to maximize their utility.

Although the above works minimize the aggregators’ peak load, devices are restricted to only a single mode of operation and do not account for the stochastic arrival of mobile devices. Practically, devices have multiple modes of operation that can be exploited to serve power to more devices within their deadlines <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.14293v1#bib.bib10" title="">10</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.p3.1">In contrast to grids where good estimates of daily, weekly or monthly schedules are available, there is more uncertainty with mobile devices such as EVs due to their stochastic arrivals and demands.

Other methods adjust the generation of renewable resources depending on the demand from EVs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.14293v1#bib.bib12" title="">12</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.14293v1#bib.bib4" title="">4</a>]</cite>.
Zhang and Cai <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.14293v1#bib.bib4" title="">4</a>]</cite> focus on increasing the profit for aggregators by utilizing Model Predictive Control (MPC) to estimate renewable generation to adjust the EV schedule whereas, Schuller et.al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.14293v1#bib.bib12" title="">12</a>]</cite> focus on reducing reliance on the grid using empirical EV data and LP to maximize renewable utilization and optimal EV scheduling.
Similar to grid-powered devices, a Stackelberg game was used between aggregators and EVs to set prices proportional to the demand to maximize the aggregator utilization and hence, the number of EVs served <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.14293v1#bib.bib1" title="">1</a>]</cite>.
A priority function is introduced based on the demand and deadline of the EVs and formulated as a binary optimization problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.14293v1#bib.bib13" title="">13</a>]</cite>. Zhu et.al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.14293v1#bib.bib14" title="">14</a>]</cite> consider multiple modes of charging linked to the time of day in a multi-stage optimization with EV scheduling where EVs change the aggregator at arrival time if the aggregator is fully loaded.
The above works on EVs are focused on optimizations to obtain EV schedules assuming EVs cannot change their geographical location.
However, by exploiting the mobility property of the EVs, movement across different aggregators can alleviate the peak load and achieve higher utility for EVs.
Load scheduling of heterogeneous devices coupled with mobility is the novelty of our proposed work.

Movement delays are representative of the distance of the aggregators from each other and the movement costs are proportional to the distance.
E.g., an EV that moves longer distance incurs higher cost and delay and vice-versa.

<p class="ltx_p" id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.1">Mobile devices consume additional energy than their initial demand to finish their tasks owing to energy loss during movement.
The loss in energy reduces the utility and consequently, increases the demand of the device from the aggregator.
This additional energy supplied by the aggregator due to mobility on top of the initial energy demand of all the devices leads to a utility loss on the grid which cannot be compensated.
Hence, there is a factor of two for the second term for utility loss due to mobility.
The loss due to mobility is given as:</p>

It is important to note that the objective is to allow a device with high criticality to consume power at the earliest to reduce the penalty in utility rather than maximizing the devices to meet their deadlines.
Hence, there could be a higher number of deadline violations while minimizing the utility loss.</p>

For this problem, we try to serve the device with the best utility within the constrained power budget of the aggregator.

<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.p2.1">Devices submit their requests to their respective cluster’s aggregator in the form of Equation <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.14293v1#S3.E1" title="In III-B Device level ‣ III Model ‣ A novel load distribution strategy for aggregators using IoT-enabled mobile devices This work was financially supported in part by the Singapore National Research Foundation under its Campus for Research Excellence And Technological Enterprise (CREATE) programme."><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> and aggregators schedule these requests to minimize the utility loss.
Each aggregator uses a <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="S4.p2.1.1">priority</em> function to establish the order in which the devices can receive power in the next time slot.
Additionally, the power mode for each device is also decided for the time slot and the schedule gets disseminated to all devices within the same cluster indicating the order in which the devices receive power.
Using this information, each device computes its corresponding utility loss.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S4.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.p3.1">Furthermore, mobile devices that cannot fulfill their demand within the deadline submit their requests to move to another aggregator.
Since the aggregators are connected using a backhaul network, each aggregator can compute the cost and the associated time of movement to other aggregators.
<span class="ltx_text" id="S4.p3.1.1" style="color:#FF0000;">The backhaul network consists of electrical connections to the grid as well as network connections with the grid operator to facilitate load data analysis.</span>
Hence, using the cost and computed utility loss for movement provided by the aggregator, mobile devices are able to take independent decisions on making a move to a different aggregator.
It is important to note that aggregators do not have any information on the future arrivals of devices and computes a schedule only based on the information in the current time slot.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p4.1">The distributed low-complexity algorithm that is executed at every time slot is shown in Algorithm <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.14293v1#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ Priority function ‣ IV Low-complexity heuristic solution ‣ A novel load distribution strategy for aggregators using IoT-enabled mobile devices This work was financially supported in part by the Singapore National Research Foundation under its Campus for Research Excellence And Technological Enterprise (CREATE) programme."><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.
At a system level (lines 1-6), the aggregators (re-)initialize the devices in its cluster-based on device arrival requests and the associated priority list.
They also initialize the <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p4.1.1">status_list</em> variable to an empty set that is later populated with aggregator utilizations (load).
Each aggregator computes the priority for each of the devices within its cluster-based on Equation <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.14293v1#S4.E10" title="In Priority function ‣ IV Low-complexity heuristic solution ‣ A novel load distribution strategy for aggregators using IoT-enabled mobile devices This work was financially supported in part by the Singapore National Research Foundation under its Campus for Research Excellence And Technological Enterprise (CREATE) programme."><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a> and sorts them in descending order.
After computing the remaining time and power to meet the device demand, the parameters are passed to the priority function shown in Equation <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.14293v1#S4.E10" title="In Priority function ‣ IV Low-complexity heuristic solution ‣ A novel load distribution strategy for aggregators using IoT-enabled mobile devices This work was financially supported in part by the Singapore National Research Foundation under its Campus for Research Excellence And Technological Enterprise (CREATE) programme."><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>.
Devices in the list are assigned power with the lowest of their feasible power modes since few modes may not be feasible based on the progress. Subsequently, any available power at the aggregator is used to upgrade to the higher power mode for devices in the same order of priority.
Lastly, the status_list is updated by communicating the utilization among the aggregators and shared with the devices for mobility.
Aggregator steps are illustrated from lines 7-17 of Algorithm <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.14293v1#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ Priority function ‣ IV Low-complexity heuristic solution ‣ A novel load distribution strategy for aggregators using IoT-enabled mobile devices This work was financially supported in part by the Singapore National Research Foundation under its Campus for Research Excellence And Technological Enterprise (CREATE) programme."><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.
At the device level (lines 18-24), mobile devices that did not receive power use the information from the status_list to compute the loss due to movement.
If the loss can be minimized at a neighboring aggregator, it sends a request to join the neighboring cluster.
The above steps are common to all devices independent of their mobility capabilities shown in steps 1-11 in Algorithm <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.14293v1#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ Priority function ‣ IV Low-complexity heuristic solution ‣ A novel load distribution strategy for aggregators using IoT-enabled mobile devices This work was financially supported in part by the Singapore National Research Foundation under its Campus for Research Excellence And Technological Enterprise (CREATE) programme."><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>

Increasing the utilization to the higher end (H) on all aggregators leads to a non-feasible schedule since each device would have a high demand, leading to some devices (low-criticality) never getting scheduled.
Devices are generated to achieve utilization by taking into consideration the maximum consumption capacity of various device classes (HVAC, EV, etc.).
For example, devices such as iron consume 1kWh, airconditioners consume about 3kWh and EVs can consume up to 50kWh.
A deadline is randomly chosen to create a periodic demand from the devices (arrival = deadline) and corresponding power modes are assigned to ensure that demand can be met.
Mobility costs and movement time between the clusters are inversely related to distance <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="S5.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p2.1.2">i.e.,</em> the farthest cluster incurs the highest mobility cost and time for movement (4, 0.15) and vice-versa (1, 0.15).</p>

For a fixed capacity of the aggregator, a lower number of devices translates to devices with higher demand (<em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="S5.SS1.p2.1.1">e.g.</em> electric buses, etc.) while a higher number of devices have devices with lower demand (<em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="S5.SS1.p2.1.2">e.g.</em> HVACs, e-scooters, etc.).
Movement may not be effective to reduce the utility loss due to the higher demand of the devices for a smaller number of devices.
Scheduling a mobile device with high demand (and associated power modes) is difficult at the aggregator as devices within its cluster also have a high demand resulting in long wait times.
Consequently, there is a higher utility loss due to mobility and deadline misses at the devices based on the resulting schedule.</p>

This can be seen by the reduction in utility loss for mobility enabled in the plot for a higher number of devices.
The scheduling can be realized practically as electric buses are more difficult to schedule than a low-power EV or electric scooter.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS2.p1.2">Typically, optimization problems are solved with a solver since a ”near-optimal” solution can be obtained.
Although a solver can produce an optimal solution in practice, the runtime to complete the simulation is prohibitive.
In our experiments, the solver runtime was observed to be upwards of <math alttext="10" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1"><semantics id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mn id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">10</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><cn id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" type="integer" xref="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1">10</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1c">10</annotation><annotation encoding="application/x-llamapun" id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1d">10</annotation></semantics></math> hours.
To prevent the long runtime, a time limit is set to the maximum time taken by the heuristic solution to terminate the simulation to obtain a feasible solution.
Additionally, we picked 10 random samples of the 50 samples in the previous experiment to test the performance of the solver.
For the same time limit, we compare the results of the solver to those from the heuristic and plot the difference in the utility loss <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="S5.SS2.p1.2.1">i.e.,</em>

With a lower number of devices and a lower proportion of mobile devices among them, the model is able to produce at least one solution due to lower complexity.
As the proportion of mobile devices increase, the number of solver variables and the resulting losses are exacerbated yielding lesser samples that can produce a feasible schedule.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S6.p1.1">In this paper, we exploit the device properties such as power modes and mobility to address the issue of load balancing and scheduling.
Our model integrates these properties to estimate the utility loss incurred due to delays in receiving the power.
We proposed an online low-complexity heuristic to minimize the utility loss with a practically feasible runtime compared to a solver with similar runtime.
Our solution also performed better by over 57.23% on a real-world dataset compared to existing scheduling solutions.
As future work, the heuristic partially integrated with the solver can speed up the solver and improve the utility loss closer to the optimal solution.
