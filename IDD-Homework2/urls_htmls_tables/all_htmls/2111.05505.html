<p id="id5.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a burgeoning distributed machine learning framework where a central parameter server (PS) coordinates many local users to train a globally consistent model.
Conventional federated learning inevitably relies on a centralized topology with a PS.
As a result, it will paralyze once the PS fails.
To alleviate such a single point failure, especially on the PS, some existing work has provided decentralized FL (DFL) implementations like CDSGD and D-PSGD to facilitate FL in a decentralized topology.
However, there are still some problems with these methods, e.g., significant divergence between users’ final models in CDSGD and a network-wide model average necessity in D-PSGD.
In order to solve these deficiency, this paper devises a new DFL implementation coined as DACFL, where each user trains its model using its own training data and exchanges the intermediate models with its neighbors through a symmetric and doubly stochastic matrix.
The DACFL treats the progress of each user’s local training as a discrete-time process and employs a first order dynamic average consensus (FODAC) method to track the <span id="id5.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">average model</span> in the absence of the PS.
In this paper, we also provide a theoretical convergence analysis of DACFL on the premise of i.i.d data to strengthen its rationality.
The experimental results on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 validate the feasibility of our solution in both time-invariant and time-varying network topologies, and declare that DACFL outperforms D-PSGD and CDSGD in most cases.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Numerously increasing smart mobile devices such as phones, tablets, etc. have provided convenience for human beings and generated plentiful user-related data like images, sound, text and others.
In order to make full use of such huge amount of data, data mining and machine learning techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> have been developed.
However, these techniques usually work on a central parameter server (PS).
This makes it inevitable to collect large amounts of users’ data into PS, which may lead to an excessive overhead and expose users’ privacy like food preference, consuming behavior, social ties and so on.
According to the general data protection regulation (GDPR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, both industry and academia should pay more attention to the privacy protection of machine learning.
Hence, taking into consideration the privacy concerns when exploiting users’ data is now becoming an imperative in the era of artificial intelligence.
To tackle this problem, Google has advocated an alternative known as federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Rather than collecting users’ raw data into a PS, the FL enables each user to train their respective models using their own data, and only the intermediate models are periodically synchronized by the PS to obtain a global model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, there exist several limitations in conventional FL due to the centralized network topology (see fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ DACFL: Dynamic Average Consensus Based Federated Learning in Decentralized Topology" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>).
For example, to iteratively synchronize users’ local-trained models and send back the aggregated global model to them, the communication load of the entire system is extremely unbalanced. Specifically, because all users need to communicate with the PS concurrently iteratively, the communication traffic jam is very likely to happen to the PS and the performance will be degraded when the network bandwidth is low.
What’s worse, if there is a single point failure that happens to the PS by any chance, e.g., being attacked, the entire framework will be paralyzed.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To eliminate the above bottleneck caused by centralized network topology, a natural idea is that, is it possible to facilitate FL in a decentralized topology (see fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ DACFL: Dynamic Average Consensus Based Federated Learning in Decentralized Topology" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>) without the support of a PS?
Thankfully, some existing work on wireless sensor network (WSN) and device-to-device (D2D) communication <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> has confirmed the possibility of communication in a decentralized network topology.
Therefore, we believe that it is not only important but also applicable to implement FL in a decentralized topology.</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we consider the problem of facilitating federated learning in a decentralized network topology in the absence of a central parameter server. To this end, we propose a new decentralized federated learning framework based on dynamic average consensus, which is coined as DACFL.
In DACFL, there is no central PS and all users are connected through an undirected graph, which is denoted by a symmetric doubly stochastic matrix (i.e., mixing matrix).
Each user trains its local model utilizing its own training data.
The respective trained model intermediates of different users are treated as different discrete-time reference input sequences.
In order to aggregate different users’ intermediate models<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>In a centralized federated learning, there is central PS to periodically aggregate different users’ model into a global model and send it back to all users. However, to implement federated learning in a decentralized network topology where no PS exists, the global aggregation phase would be a critical problem.</span></span></span>, for each user, we employ an approximate estimation method, i.e., a first-order dynamic average consensus (FODAC), to track the <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">average model</span> estimation.
Besides, to alleviate the possible local over-fitting problem, especially for non-i.i.d data, each user in DACFL takes its neighborhood weighted average model parameter to reinitialize its local model after each training round.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Actually, there has been some existing work to date devoting to implementing federated learning in a fully decentralized network topology (as is described in <a href="#S2.SS2" title="2.2 Decentralized Federated Learning Implementation ‣ 2 Related Works ‣ DACFL: Dynamic Average Consensus Based Federated Learning in Decentralized Topology" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.2</span></a>).
Apart from them, references <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> should be the most similar work to this paper.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, the authors propose a new consensus-based distributed SGD (CDSGD) algorithm for collaborative deep learning over a fixed network topology that enables data parallelization as well as decentralized computation.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, the authors study a decentralized parallel SGD (D-PSGD) algorithm on a decentralized computational network. They further prove that D-PSGD achieves the same convergence rate as the centralized parallel SGD (C-PSGD) algorithm, but outperforms C-PSGD by avoiding the communication jam.
Although some existing work summarizes CDSGD and D-PSGD into the same method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, note that we distinguish between CDSGD and D-PSGD by whether the algorithm requires a global average or not in this paper (D-PSGD additionally needs a network-wide model average compared with CDSGD).
In what follows, we describe the deficiency of CDSGD and D-PSGD, and differentiate our solution from these two methods in detail.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">For CDSGD in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, there are two main limitations.
One is that it only considers a fixed network topology with a uniform interaction matrix (identical value of each element in the matrix). The other is that it assumes that the training data is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) over all users.
These two limitations make it not well suited for federated learning since mutative network topology and non-i.i.d data are common occurrences in federated learning.
Besides, we empirically verify that when faced with a sparse topology, there is obvious variance across all users’ final models.
This is also inconsistent with the goal of FL to attain a globally consistent model for all users.
While for D-PSGD which additionally performs a network-wide model average in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, since there is no PS in decentralized network topology, a problem that naturally arises is who should perform this network-wide model average task? And how to ensure the consistency of each user’s model? Just imagine, if we make each user perform this network-wide average (although this is achievable by exchanging information through multi-hop communication), it will inevitably cause communication congestion in some users (especially those user nodes with higher degrees on the graph).
Besides, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> consider only a fixed ring network topology.
Our solution differentiates CDSGD and D-PSGD from the following aspects.
First, rather than taking roughly the neighborhood weighted average to replace the model aggregation like CDSGD or D-PSGD does, the DACFL employs an average consensus method, i.e., FODAC, to approximate the <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">average model</span> for each user.
Thanks to the effectiveness of FODAC, each user is able to track the <span id="S1.p6.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">average model</span> as the training progresses. Thus, no additional network-wide model average is needed in our DACFL.
Second, we extend more typical network topologies in this work. Apart from time-invariant (or static) and dense topology, we also consider time-varying (or dynamic) and sparse topology in this paper.
Third, non-i.i.d data assignment in addition to i.i.d case is also considered in this paper.
To alleviate the possible local over-fitting problem, each user in DACFL takes its neighborhood weighted average model parameter to reinitialize its local model after each training round.

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">From the technical perspective, there are two main strategies implementing federated learning: Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL) and Vertical Federated Learning<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
In HFL, participating clients share the same set of features but target different populations. While in VFL, the client devices share the same population but target different sets of features. Note that throughout this paper, we focus only on the HFL. For detail introduction about VFL, please refer to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The concept of federated learning was first introduced<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, where a distributed training model is executed by a number of participants, usually called clients or users, that share local model updates with a central parameter server whose role is to aggregate these updates to build a global model.
Generally, a federated learning scenario consists of two main phases, i.e., <span id="S2.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">local update</span> and <span id="S2.SS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">global aggregation</span>. In the <span id="S2.SS1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">local update</span> phase, clients compute the gradients to minimize the underlying loss function using their local data. While in the <span id="S2.SS1.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">global aggregation</span> phase, the central parameter server collects the model updates from different clients, aggregates these model updates to form a global model and then sends back the aggregated result to the clients for their next training epoch.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Actually, apart from references <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> which have been introduced in section <a href="#S1" title="1 Introduction ‣ DACFL: Dynamic Average Consensus Based Federated Learning in Decentralized Topology" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, there has also been some existing work to date devoting to deep learning with decentralized computation without the aid of a PS.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, the authors present a distributed learning algorithm to address the fully decentralized federated learning problem.
In this framework, users take a Bayesian-like approach to iterate and aggregate the beliefs of their one-hop neighbors and collaboratively estimate the global optimal parameter.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, the authors propose a server-less, peer-to-peer approach for federated learning termed <span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">BrainTorrent</span>, particularly targeted towards medical applications.
In this approach, all clients are assumed pair-wise connected and update their models by checking the local model version with the latest model version over the network.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, the authors propose a decentralized federated learning design, Combo, based on the gossip protocol. They also present a model segmentation level synchronization mechanism in order to maximize the utilization of bandwidth capacities between users. However, their design also requires a fully connected network topology and a prerequisite of randomly distributed data among the workers.
While in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, the authors further extend the Combo into a bandwidth aware solution BACombo by greedily choosing the bandwidth-sufficient worker to reduce the transmission delay.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, the authors design an experimental study to compare federated learning with gossip learning, and find that gossip learning is comparable to federated learning in their result.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, the authors propose a decentralized federated learning framework based on blockchain termed BFLC. The framework uses blockchain for the global model storage and the local model update exchange without a central server.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, the authors introduce a fully decentralized federated learning framework, termed IPLS, that is partially based on the interplanetary file system (IPFS). By using IPLS and connecting into the corresponding private IPFS network, any party can initiate the training process of a model or join an ongoing training process that has already been started by another party.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, the authors propose the decentralized federated learning via mutual knowledge transfer (Def-KT) algorithm where local clients fuse models by transferring their knowledge to each other.</p>

It has already been widely used in various fields such as formation control <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, sensor fusion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, distributed estimation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> and distributed tracking <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>.</p>

In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, the authors use standard frequency-domain techniques and show that their algorithm is able to track the average of ramp reference inputs with zero steady-state error.
In the context of input-to-state stability, the authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> show that proportional dynamic average consensus algorithm can track with bounded steady-state error the average of bounded reference inputs with bounded derivatives. Besides, a proportional-integral dynamic average consensus algorithm is also designed to track the average of constant reference inputs with sufficiently small steady-state error.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, the authors propose a dynamic consensus algorithm and apply it to design consensus filters. Their algorithm can track with some bounded steady-state error the average of a common reference input with a bounded derivative.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, the authors study a problem similar to that in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> but further assume that agents know the nonlinear model which generates the time-varying reference function.</p>

However, to implement federated learning, a <span id="S3.SS1.p3.11.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">global aggregation</span> phase is still needed in addition to <span id="S3.SS1.p3.11.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">local update</span>.
So, we are now faced with the problem of how to make nodes periodically synchronize the <span id="S3.SS1.p3.11.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">average model</span> in the absence of a central PS?</p>

<div id="S6.SS1.SSS5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS1.SSS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we compare our DACFL with a conventional centralized federated learning method, i.e., FedAvg and another two decentralized federated learning implementations called CDSGD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> and D-PSGD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
For the FedAvg implementation in this paper, a centralized topology with the same number of users to the decentralized topology is considered, where all users are ensured to participate in each training round.
For CDSGD and D-PSGD, the mixing matrix and other hyper-parameters are consistent with DACFL.
Additionally, we assume that there still exists a “god node” for D-PSGD to perform the network-wide model average, hence generating a global model used for the performance test.
To make the result more clear, we design two metrics including <span id="S6.SS1.SSS5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Average of Acc</span> and <span id="S6.SS1.SSS5.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Var of Acc</span> to indicate the performances of different methods.
Specifically, we respectively test each user’s trained model (or estimated model in DACFL) and get the test accuracy of all users. Then the <span id="S6.SS1.SSS5.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Average of Acc</span> is computed through averaging all users’ test accuracy and <span id="S6.SS1.SSS5.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Var of Acc</span> is the variance over all users’ test accuracy.
Generally, a superior decentralized federated learning method is expected to obtain a higher <span id="S6.SS1.SSS5.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Average of Acc</span> and a smaller <span id="S6.SS1.SSS5.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Var of Acc</span>.
Note that for FedAvg and D-PSGD where the final output is the only global model, the <span id="S6.SS1.SSS5.p1.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Average of Acc</span> is actually same with the test accuracy and the <span id="S6.SS1.SSS5.p1.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Var of Acc</span> is 0.</p>

<p id="S6.SS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">As can be seen in fig. <a href="#S6.F3.sf1" title="In Figure 3 ‣ 6.2 Why Choose FODAC? A Numerically Empirical Perspective ‣ 6 Experiments and Performance Evaluation ‣ DACFL: Dynamic Average Consensus Based Federated Learning in Decentralized Topology" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3(a)</span></a>, the FODAC is superior to CDSGD when users’ reference inputs are with large variance under both sparse and dense mixing matrices. It can be concluded that if employing CDSGD to approximate the average of inputs, an estimating error and a large deviation between users are not negligible.
While the CDSGD becomes feasible only when the inputs turn to be with small variance or when the mixing matrix is uniform. Nonetheless, the FODAC still slightly outperforms CDSGD from the perspective of convergence speed when users’ inputs are with small variance under both sparse and dense mixing matrices, which are shown in Fig. <a href="#S6.F3.sf2" title="In Figure 3 ‣ 6.2 Why Choose FODAC? A Numerically Empirical Perspective ‣ 6 Experiments and Performance Evaluation ‣ DACFL: Dynamic Average Consensus Based Federated Learning in Decentralized Topology" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3(b)</span></a>.
Note that D-PSGD outperforms the other two methods because it additionally executes a network-wide average which enables it to accurately compute the average value of the inputs. However, such a network-wide average is unacceptable when it comes to a fully decentralized topology where no PS helps to do this.</p>

<p id="S6.SS2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">From this empirical result, we conclude that the FODAC method is more adaptable than CDSGD and D-PSGD on approximating the average in a fully decentralized topology. Actually, this also motivates us to employ FODAC to decentralized federated learning since (i) the common non-i.i.d data usually leads to a large variance between users’ local models; (ii) a non-ideal communication topology (a not uniform mixing matrix) often arises in practical; (iii) there is no central PS to perform a network-wide model average.</p>

Since D-PSGD additionally performs a network-wide model average over all users, it holds a better <span id="S6.SS3.SSS1.p2.18.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Average of Acc</span> than CDSGD.
Contrarily, there exists different levels of deviation between user’s intermediate training models, which may severely rely on the unevenness of the decentralized communication network topology.
By means of FODAC, each user in DACFL is able to well approximate the “near average” model.
This is exactly why DACFL outperforms CDSGD and D-PSGD in this experiment.</p>

Intuitively, the FedAvg with a centralized topology performs better than other decentralized implementations as it has a central parameter server to do the <span id="S6.SS3.SSS2.p2.3.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">global aggregation</span> phase.

<div id="S6.SS3.SSS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS3.SSS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Besides, a time-varying topology has greater randomness than a time-invariant topology.
Due to the randomness, the accuracy degradation caused by the topology sparsity becomes smaller for all decentralized implementations considered in this section.
Specially, for D-PSGD on FMNIST (fig. <a href="#S6.F5.sf2" title="In Figure 5 ‣ 6.3 Performance on i.i.d Data ‣ 6 Experiments and Performance Evaluation ‣ DACFL: Dynamic Average Consensus Based Federated Learning in Decentralized Topology" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5(b)</span></a>) and CIFAR-10 (fig. <a href="#S6.F5.sf3" title="In Figure 5 ‣ 6.3 Performance on i.i.d Data ‣ 6 Experiments and Performance Evaluation ‣ DACFL: Dynamic Average Consensus Based Federated Learning in Decentralized Topology" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5(c)</span></a>), the average accuracy under a sparse topology is even greater than that under a dense topology.
This might because that the randomness introduced by time-varying topology reduces the possibility of early over-fitting that may be caused by a sparse topology.</p>

This is because the non-i.i.d property would lead to users’ local model divergence and early over-fitting.
Since D-PSGD additionally performs a net-work wide model average, it has higher accuracy than DACFL and CDSGD in MNIST and FMNIST.<span id="footnote6" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">6</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">6</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">6</span>Since all three DFL approaches do not converge in CIFAR-10, the result on CIFAR-10 is not counted here.</span></span></span>
However, we should note that a network-wide model average usually becomes impractical when users are very scattered in a very large decentralized topology since an acceptable overhead would be caused by such a network-wide communication.
Therefore, in case that there is no network-wide model average, our DACFL outperforms CDSGD.
Take the result under dense topology as an example, DACFL gets average accuracy of <math id="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="86\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">86</mn><mo id="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2">86</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1c">86\%</annotation></semantics></math>, <math id="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="70\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">70</mn><mo id="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.2">70</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.2.m2.1c">70\%</annotation></semantics></math>, while CDSGD only reaches <math id="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="58\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.3.m3.1a"><mrow id="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.3.m3.1.1" xref="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.3.m3.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.3.m3.1.1.2" xref="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml">58</mn><mo id="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.3.m3.1.1.1" xref="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.3.m3.1b"><apply id="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.3.m3.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.3.m3.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.3.m3.1.1.2">58</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.3.m3.1c">58\%</annotation></semantics></math>, <math id="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="40\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.4.m4.1a"><mrow id="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.4.m4.1.1" xref="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.4.m4.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.4.m4.1.1.2" xref="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.4.m4.1.1.2.cmml">40</mn><mo id="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.4.m4.1.1.1" xref="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.4.m4.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.4.m4.1b"><apply id="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.4.m4.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.4.m4.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.4.m4.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.4.m4.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.4.m4.1.1.2">40</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS4.SSS1.p2.4.m4.1c">40\%</annotation></semantics></math> on MNIST and FMNIST, respectively.</p>

Because the randomness introduced by time-variant topology may alleviate the local model over-fitting caused by non-i.i.d data, our DACFL has a better performance than that of a time-invariant topology shown in Fig. <a href="#S6.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 6.4.1 Time-invariant Topology ‣ 6.4 Performance on non-i.i.d Data ‣ 6 Experiments and Performance Evaluation ‣ DACFL: Dynamic Average Consensus Based Federated Learning in Decentralized Topology" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, especially on FMNIST and CIFAR-10.

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Over-reliance on the central PS makes the federated learning possibly paralyze when the server breaks down.
To alleviate this single point failure in conventional FL, existing researches have offered different DFL implementations including CDSGD and D-PSGD.
However, there exists significant variance between users’ final models in CDSGD while D-PSGD necessitates a network-wide model average.
In this paper, we devise a new DFL method coined as DACFL to solve the deficiency in CDSGD and D-PSGD.
The DACFL treats the respective local training processes as discrete-time series and employ FODAC to track the <span id="S7.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">average model</span> over all users.
To confirm the feasibility of DACFL, we also deliver a theoretical analysis on the premise of some assumptions, which offers a convergence guarantee of our solution.
Besides, we design specific experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 under i.i.d and non-i.i.d allocations, and compare the DACFL with D-PSGD and CDSGD.
The results verify the effectiveness of DACFL under different network topologies, and declare that DACFL outperforms D-PSGD and CDSGD in most cases.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">There are several issues need further investigation.
First, DACFL solves the problems of CDSGD and D-PSGD at the expense of more communication overhead because each user exchanges both estimation states and local models during the training progress. Therefore, a more communication-efficient method for DACFL is deserved.
Second, since this work only considers DACFL with synchronized settings, an asynchronized decentralized federated learning deserves investigation for practical application.
Third, because DACFL works effectively only when mixing matrix is symmetric and doubly stochastic, users dropping out or joining in during the training process will change the nature of mixing matrix and thus yields negative effects on this method. Thus, designing an offline and join aware DACFL would be worthy of future research.</p>
