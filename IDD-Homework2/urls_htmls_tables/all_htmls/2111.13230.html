<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative learning of a deep learning model without sharing the data of participating sites. FL in medical image analysis tasks is relatively new and open for enhancements. In this study, we propose <span id="id3.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedDropoutAvg</span>, a new federated learning approach for training a generalizable model. The proposed method takes advantage of randomness, both in client selection and also in federated averaging process. We compare <span id="id3.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedDropoutAvg</span> to several algorithms in an FL scenario for real-world multi-site histopathology image classification task. We show that with <span id="id3.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedDropoutAvg</span>, the final model can achieve performance better than other FL approaches and closer to a classical deep learning model that requires all data to be shared for centralized training. We test the trained models on a large dataset consisting of 1.2 million image tiles from 21 different centers. To evaluate the generalization ability of the
proposed approach, we use held-out test sets from centers whose data was used in the FL and for unseen data from other independent centers whose data was not used in the federated training. We show that the proposed approach is more generalizable than other state-of-the-art federated training approaches. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study to use a randomized client and local model parameter selection procedure in a federated setting for a medical image analysis task.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, deep learning methods have shown success in many different tasks including those in computational pathology <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. A major drawback to these approaches is the need for large amounts of data to train the networks. This drawback is even more obstructive in the medical field, as medical data are difficult to access and their sharing may be subject to legal and ethical limitations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> allows to overcome these challenges. While in traditional deep learning approaches, all data is required to be co-located in a central server where model training takes place, in an FL paradigm, each of the multiple decentralized centers holding local data can train the model on their own servers. By enabling training of the deep learning models collaboratively without exchanging the datasets, FL offers a solution to data ownership and governance issues <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Existing FL methods comprise of several rounds of local training and federal aggregation steps. In each round of the federated training process, each data-holder trains a model for some number of epochs on their local dataset. The local data-holders then send their trained models to a central server for model aggregation. The aggregated model is sent back to the data-holders for further training rounds.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Model aggregation is an important step for the overall performance. The most common method of model aggregation in existing FL studies is Federated Averaging (FedAvg) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. FedAvg is weighted averaging of local model parameters (the gradients) to obtain a global model at each round. The weights in this case are determined based on the number of training samples of each local data-holder. Li <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> argued that local models are often substantially different from global models because of the heterogeneous and imbalanced nature of the datasets. Therefore, they proposed FedProx, which contained a proximal term in the loss function to restrict the effects of local training and prevent divergence from the global model parameters.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Study of FL in the area of medical image analysis is relatively new.

Most of the FL studies in medical imaging have employed FedAvg method for model aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.

</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Medical image datasets can be very heterogeneous and unbalanced. Besides being unbalanced in terms of number of samples, the data quality and the diversity of different samples could differ by a large margin. In this case, the approach of FedAvg and FedProx, weighting the contributions of each local model by their data size, may have limitations. Since we cannot know beforehand which private local dataset(s) will generalize better for the test set of another center, measuring the contributions of individual centers and accurately weighting them is not feasible. While local validation set performances could be used to increase the weight of under-performing centers during training, these under-performing centers could have low data-quality and may not be worth learning strongly for the greater good. Therefore, we propose introducing dropout strategies for global model aggregation and clients participating in FL training to mitigate the complexities of learning from imbalanced and heterogeneous datasets from various clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose Federated Dropout Averaging (FedDropoutAvg), a new FL aggregation method with the objective of obtaining a global federal model that achieves maximum performance by adjusting dropping out of the parameters of locally trained models before aggregation and also randomly dropping out some clients at each round. Our approach is inspired by FL model training with sensitive user data on mobile devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, where thousands of clients participate and several clients may also get dropped out at each training round due to various reasons and constraints like unstable connectivity or efficiency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. However, the impact of clients dropping in FL training for medical image analysis tasks remained unexplored.</p>

<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">The proposed federated dropout averaging method for aggregating weights and parameters of deep neural network models trained at different client sites into a federated model is also different from the well-known dropout technique used to drop weights of the neurons during training of standard convolutional neural network by Srivastava <span id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. We present a comparative evaluation of the proposed method with locally trained models, the model trained in a centralized manner and two major FL model aggregation methods for histopathology image classification. We explore the comparative performance of the different methods on multi-institutional histopathology images datasets using federated models in real-world setting, using not only test data from centers (clients) participating in training but also the held-out test data from completely different centers.</p>

We used this trained network to separate the tumor and non-tumor tiles from the entire TCGA cohort.</p>

This strengthens the motivation to put federated learning into practise. Comparing locally trained models with each other, we see that some of the locally trained models are indeed do best on the test set of the same client they are trained on (CM, A6, DY, G4, AA). Surprisingly we observe this is not the case for majority of them. For example, we see that the model locally trained on the training data of DC give the best F1 results compared to other local models on the test sets of AY and AH. Likewise, among other local models, the locally trained model on A6 is best for AF, CK and DC; and locally trained model on AA is best for AG. These results point to complexity of the underlying relationships between the different local models. They also supports our initial motivation about not being able to measure the individual contributions of each local dataset without sharing the datasets.</p>

Centralized, federated and local training methods are compared. The WSIs in this figure are from four different independent testing centers (AD, F4, NH, D5), thus the models are not trained on these centers’ dataset. The best local models are selected based on comparison of all of the locally trained models by the slide-level F1 metrics.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For all of the WSIs, our proposed method has given better results than other federated approaches (FedAvg, FedProx) both qualitatively and in terms of F1 score. In the last three columns, we see that best of the locally trained models give better results than federated approaches. The results in the last column can be regarded as a fail case for all of the federated models, although it should be noted that our model still gives better results.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we demonstrated <span id="S4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedDropoutAvg</span> method as a better way to train models with federated learning for histopathological image analysis tasks. In the application we presented, <span id="S4.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedDropoutAvg</span> achieved closer performance to the conventional training where all of the data is centralized in a data lake, compared to other major federated learning approaches. We think that our strategy will allow us to achieve the goal of training better and more robust models with higher clinical usefulness while maintaining the privacy of the data via federated learning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The dropout method in the literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> is a generic technique to reduce over-fitting while training a routine neural network and it is different than our approach in several ways. Firstly, it is to be used in a single neural network training and not for FL settings. Our approach is proposed for adapting model aggregation step of FL. Also, in this method only hidden layer model weight parameters are dropped-out at training time. In our proposed method, all of the model parameters might be dropped-out before federated aggregation step, including the ones in the first and final layers, and also the bias parameters. Also, the obtained aggregated global model is used both for further training rounds and/or testing.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">There have been other FL studies inspired by the drop-out method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. Namely, “Federated Dropout” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> and “Adaptive Federated Dropout” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. The main goal of both of these approaches is to increase communication efficiency by decreasing the model size to be sent and received by the local clients(mobile devices). Since those studies are for FL in mobile devices, communication efficiency is an important aspect due to the large number of devices involved in the training. In these approaches, each local client trains a smaller model (a submodel of the global model) to reduce model size and update size, while the server has the whole global model. Clients train a selected subset of the global model, and it is either a random subset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> or dynamically selected subset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. Then, the server maps and reunites those smaller locally trained models into the global model. Differently than these approaches, we propose to train the same whole global model architecture locally at each client, achieving better trained local models and a much more flexible drop-out application at aggregation time.</p>

<div id="S4.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Although there are other FL optimization methods in the literature, those are usually different additions to the FedAvg method. Because of this, in this study, we only used the major ones for comparison. We strongly believe that our proposed approach can easily be combined with other additional optimization techniques (e.g., gradient averaging with momentum of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>).</p>

As a result, at each round, computation will only take place at the selected subset of clients. The clients who are not selected do not need to communicate with the server at the end of the round, providing a straightforward way to increase communication efficiency. Also, total amount of computation time will be decreased, since it is proportional to total amount of data of the selected clients. We did not provide an analysis of this aspect since the amount of data of each local training client is very heterogeneous in our dataset. In the future, additional multiple experiments can be done to understand computational efficiency of the proposed method.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning can help different institutions contribute to the training of powerful models without requiring any training data to be shared. In this paper, we proposed <span id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedDropoutAvg</span> and explored this federated training approach for real-world multi-site histopathology image classification and compared it with various existing federated learning methods. We evaluated the trained models on an independent test set of clients which have not participated in the training process. We showed that by using the proposed federated learning method, it is possible to achieve a classification performance comparable to a centralized model that requires data from all the clients used for training the model. In this study, we did not examine the privacy limitations of the proposed approach. We did not consider the data leakage from the model parameters if someone attempts to reconstruct the data using the model parameters exchanged during the federated training (i.e., a model inversion attack). In future, the effects of the proposed approach on privacy and combination of the proposed approach with different privacy-preserving techniques can be examined. Model aggregation is a critical piece of the FL paradigm and the improvement in performance and generalization ability of this new federated aggregation method has rich potential for usage in the future FL models.</p>
