<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, mobile clients’ computing ability and storage capacity have greatly improved, efficiently dealing with some applications locally. Federated learning is a promising distributed machine learning solution that uses local computing and local data to train the Artificial Intelligence (AI) model. Combining local computing and federated learning can train a powerful AI model under the premise of ensuring local data privacy while making full use of mobile clients’ resources. However, the heterogeneity of local data, that is, Non-independent and identical distribution (Non-IID) and imbalance of local data size, may bring a bottleneck hindering the application of federated learning in mobile edge computing (MEC) system. Inspired by this, we propose a cluster-based clients selection method that can generate a federated virtual dataset that satisfies the global distribution to offset the impact of data heterogeneity and proved that the proposed scheme could converge to an approximate optimal solution. Based on the clustering method, we propose an auction-based clients selection scheme within each cluster that fully considers the system’s energy heterogeneity and gives the Nash equilibrium solution of the proposed scheme for balance the energy consumption and improving the convergence rate. The simulation results show that our proposed selection methods and auction-based federated learning can achieve better performance with the Convolutional Neural Network model (CNN) under different data distributions.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Machine learning is applied to various fields, including medical care, autonomous driving, finance, etc. Massive data generated by mobile clients can effectively promote the improvement of machine learning technology. However, these data directly or indirectly reveal the privacy of users. With the increase of people’s awareness of privacy and the introduction of privacy protection laws, privacy data leakage has become one of the main bottlenecks hindering artificial intelligence development. Federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> is proposed as a promising distributed learning to alleviate the privacy leakage problem of machine learning. Unlike traditional machine learning and distributed machine learning, there is no need to centralize user data for AI model training. In the federated learning system, clients only need to transmit the model parameters or gradients trained on their local data to the aggregation server, thereby protecting data privacy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, data heterogeneity brings new challenges to federated learning development. Wang <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> proposed a reinforcement learning solution to solve federated learning in Non-IID scenarios. Since this scheme requires multiple rounds of reinforcement learning model training in advance for different scenarios, its generalization ability is weak. There are also some clustering solutions to solve this challenge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. For example, Sattler <em id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> divided the clients into several groups based on the similarity of the local model and then train in each group to improve the average accuracy. The above solutions have shown specific effects in dealing with Non-IID scenarios, but they ignore the imbalance of local data. That is, the size of data generated by different clients is inconsistent. Cai <em id="S1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> proposes a scheme that using dynamic samples to solve the problem of data imbalance without considering the impact of Non-IID.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Also, especially in wireless edge networks, the energy consumption of mobile clients is usually limited. How to balance the clients’ energy consumption in the system is another core challenge for developing federated learning in the mobile edge computing system. Clients are required to perform calculations, making mobile clients unwilling to participate in federated learning due to limited energy. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> design incentive mechanism to give part of the benefits to participating clients to encourage them to participate in federated learning. These schemes fully consider the resource status when selecting clients and are committed to minimizing the federated learning system’s overall resource consumption but ignoring individual clients’ energy consumption.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning can effectively solve the problem of user data privacy leakage in traditional machine learning. Furthermore, it can make full use of the remaining computing power of idle edge clients. On the one hand, federated learning systems’ data heterogeneity has become one of the main bottlenecks of federated learning development. Wang <em id="S1.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> observed that the clustering scheme could speed up the convergence speed of the global model compared with randomly selecting user local models on Non-IID. They also verified the effectiveness of the clustering algorithm through experiments. However, in their experimental settings, each user has the same number of data samples, which is unrealistic in real system scenarios. The real scene is different users have different data sizes, which means the scale of data owned by edge clients is imbalanced. Therefore, in our research, we will fully consider the two aspects of data heterogeneity: Non-IID and imbalances of local data. Besides, they did not give a theoretical analysis. On the other hand, partial edge clients are selected for training in each iteration. Appropriate edge client selection can effectively improve the convergence rate of the global model. However, the energy of mobile edge clients is limited. Therefore, we proposed the energy balanced selection mechanism in this paper.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, federated learning [1] as a special distributed machine learning approach has been widely studied by researchers. On the one hand, the original intention of federated learning is to train the AI model to ensure data privacy. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> study federated learning from the perspective of protecting client’s data privacy and AI model. On the other hand, different from the traditional distributed machine learning system, the federated learning system’s communication environment is more complex and uncertain. Therefore, reducing communication overhead and improving communication efficiency is another core challenge of federated learning. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> is devoted to reducing the communication cost of
federated learning or the communication rounds required for training.
Recently, the heterogeneity of federated learning systems has become the main bottleneck of its development. FL heterogeneity is divided into data heterogeneity and structural heterogeneity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our research is mainly to solve the challenge of data heterogeneity in the federated learning model’s training process. In terms of training data samples, unlike conventional distributed machine learning, the training data samples of federated learning are generally Non-IID.

They also pointed out that the FedAvg algorithm is still applicable when the data of clients is Non-IID. Li <em id="S2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> theoretically analyzed the effectiveness of the FedAvg algorithm and show that the convergence rate of FedAvg algorithm under Non-IID is significantly worse than under IID.

Besides, they proposed a data-sharing strategy, which is to improve the accuracy of model training by sharing part of the data that meets the global distribution. However, without knowing the distribution of clients, it is not easy to make all client data evenly distributed by sharing data samples. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> analyzed the convergence bounds of gradient descent algorithm in federated learning system under Non-IID setting.

They also verified the effectiveness of this scheme through experiments. However, there are still two problems with t
heir strategy. Firstly, in their experimental settings, each client has the same number of data samples. In a simple federated learning system, different clients have a different number of local data samples. Secondly, after only one epoch of SGD update, the local model parameters may not reflect the local distribution.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p8.1" class="ltx_p">As shown in Fig. 4, the client selection schemes with clustering strategy shows better performance than FedAvg scheme. The reason is that virtual datasets constructed by the first two scheme is closer to the global distribution, and the distribution of the virtual dataset in each iteration is similar, thereby reducing the impact of data heterogeneity. Since our proposed scheme fully considers the imbalance of the data, the clustering is more accurate.
Therefore, our scheme has a higher convergence rate than the other two schemes.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.3" class="ltx_p">In section III, we experimentally verify that the clustering scheme can effectively improve global model training convergence under the Non-IID and imbalanced setting. However, in wireless edge networks, most clients are mobile clients whose energy is limited. Randomly selecting clients from each cluster for the next round of training will cause some clients’ excessive consumption. Therefore, in this section, we propose an auction-based client selection scheme in each cluster. The auction mechanism is a game theory model which consists of two roles, auctioneers and bidders. As shown in Fig. 1, each group constitutes an auction system. Unlike traditional cloud computing systems, edge clients act as a bidder in this auction system, providing data services and computing services. Also, the cloud aggregation server acts as an auctioneer, and the server trains a global AI model by purchasing data services and computing services from the bidders.

<div id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.11" class="ltx_p">The quality of service provided by clients determines the service cost. Moreover, clients’ quality of service depends on the quality and quantity of their samples. Clients with more data samples can accelerate the model’s convergence, which means that the clients have a better quality of service. To ensure that clients with higher service quality have a higher probability of participating in training, we set the sample size to be inversely proportional to the cost. Besides, for the global model, the more data samples involved in training can improve the model’s generalization ability. Therefore, we record the historical participation rounds of clients. With the increase of clients’ participation rounds, our model appropriately reduces service quality to ensure that the clients with less sample number can participate in the training. So, our service cost is calculated as follows:</p>

For the second, the server and clients share the economic profits of the AI model according to a certain proportional relationship. In other words, we divide the profit of AI model into each round equally, and then divide each profit equally according to the number of clients participating in the training in each round. After that, the server shares this benefit with each client participating in the training in a certain proportion. We take the bid of the client as the proportion of each benefit, so the reward function of client at this time can be expressed as:</p>

<p id="S4.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this subsection, we describe our proposed edge clients selection algorithm in detail. From the server’s perspective, the edge clients selection algorithm’s function is to select appropriate edge clients to participate in federated learning training, thereby accelerating the global model’s convergence rate. From the perspective of edge clients, the client selection algorithm’s goal is to maximize the benefits for users and avoid excessive energy consumption. So, we designed an auction-based edge clients selection algorithm, as shown in Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1 has three main stages, gradient-based clustering, auction-based selection, and federated training.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.2" class="ltx_p">We have implemented our scheme in a federated learning simulator developed from scratch using PyTorch under a device with a 3.0GHz CPU frequency. We choose three classic picture datasets for dataset selection: MNIST, Fashion MNIST (represented by FMNIST), and CIFAR-10. These datasets all contain ten types of data samples, and the former two datasets both have 70,000 images, 60,000 for training, and 10,000 for testing. The latter has 60,000 images, 50,000 for training, and 10,000 for testing. In terms of the AI model, we trained three different models, including CNN for MNIST<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>The CNN for MNIST has 10 layers with the following structure: 5×5×10 Convolutional

Firstly, the AI model trained by the federated learning system has certain economic returns, which belong to the whole federated learning system. In other words, the server and clients share the economic returns of the AI model. Secondly, we divide the economic returns equally according to the communication rounds required by the training model. Thirdly, we mainly measure all clients’ average bids for clients’ prices in each round of the system. The reward mainly includes two parts: server-side and clients side. For the server-side, we record the server’s reward with the number of communication rounds. For the client’s side, we mainly consider the sum of each round of training’s benefits.</p>

As the number of training rounds increases, the remaining energy of the client is decreasing, so the cost and bid will also increase. Besides, it also shows that the client’s bid will be lower when the battery is full, which is also in line with economic theory. Fig. 8 also shows that with the increase of communication rounds, the server’s reward per round decreases. This is because the bidding of clients is increasing, and the proportion of clients in reward is also increasing, so the server-side reward is decreasing.</p>

As shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, the proposed cluster selection client scheme is better than FedAvg and FedProx in convergence rate. The reason is that the first two schemes fully consider the local data distribution of different clients when sampling clients. Through the clustering sampling strategy, a virtual data set is constructed in each round, which approximates the global distribution in distribution, thereby alleviating the influence of data heterogeneity on the global model’s convergence. However, for FedAvg and Fedprox with random sampling strategy, the distribution of the selected local data set is different in different rounds, which has a negative impact on the convergence of the global model. Besides, compared to randomly selecting a client from each class after clustering, the auction-based client selection scheme can show a faster convergence rate. This is because our auction scheme fully considers the local data size when choosing clients, making the average number of training samples larger than our proposed cluster scheme. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 7, our proposed clustering client selection scheme shows a better convergence rate when IID dominates (<math id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\nu=0.5" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2.3.m3.1a"><mrow id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2.3.m3.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml">ν</mi><mo id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml">0.5</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2.3.m3.1b"><apply id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2.3.m3.1.1"><eq id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.1"></eq><ci id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.2">𝜈</ci><cn type="float" id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.3">0.5</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2.3.m3.1c">\nu=0.5</annotation></semantics></math>).

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In terms of energy consumption, for the balance of remaining energy, we use the standard deviation of all clients’ remaining energy in the system as the metric to measure the balance of energy consumption. The system energy consumption is balanced when the standard deviation is smaller. We set the system client to 100 and then verify the scheme’s effectiveness in three different Non-IID scenarios. As shown in Fig. 9 and Fig. 10, our proposed auction-based selection scheme shows a better balance than the other schemes. The reason is that the auction-based client’s selection scheme fully considers the clients’ remaining energy consumption in the cost function and then bids according to the optimal solution that satisfies the Nash equilibrium to achieve the balance of energy consumption in the system. Since the FedAvg and FedProx scheme uses a random sample selection strategy, some clients with many local samples may consume too much energy.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In our research, we are committed to solving the data heterogeneity problem faced by the federated learning system by designing a client selection scheme. Thus, we design a client selection method based on initial gradient clustering. This method mainly includes three innovations. Firstly, we introduce the concept of a federated virtual data set for the first time to provide a solution to the data heterogeneity of the federated learning system. Secondly, we proposed the sample windows mechanism , whose goal is to alleviate the impact of local data imbalance on clustering accuracy. Thirdly, we prove that our proposed client’s selection method can converge to the approximate optimal solution under the stochastic gradient descent algorithm.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, we designed an auction-based client selection algorithm in each cluster, which aims to solve the imbalance of resource consumption caused by the random selection of clients. At the same time, we introduced energy-balanced metrics in the federal learning scenario for the first time. Simulation results show that our proposed client selection scheme can achieve better performance in the AI model’s convergence rate and the energy consumption balance of the system.</p>
