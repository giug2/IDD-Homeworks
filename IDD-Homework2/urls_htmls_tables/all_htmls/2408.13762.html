<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">This paper addresses the challenges of designing mesh convolution neural networks for 3D mesh dense prediction. While deep learning has achieved remarkable success in image dense prediction tasks, directly applying or extending these methods to irregular graph data, such as 3D surface meshes, is nontrivial due to the non-uniform element distribution and irregular connectivity in surface meshes which make it difficult to adapt downsampling, upsampling, and convolution operations. In addition, commonly used multiresolution networks require repeated high-to-low and then low-to-high processes to boost the performance of recovering rich, high-resolution representations.
To address these challenges, this paper proposes a self-parameterization-based multi-resolution convolution network that extends existing image dense prediction architectures to 3D meshes. The novelty of our approach lies in two key aspects.
First, we construct a multi-resolution mesh pyramid directly from the high-resolution input data and propose area-aware mesh downsampling/upsampling operations that use sequential bijective inter-surface mappings between different mesh resolutions. The inter-surface mapping redefines the mesh, rather than reshaping it, which thus avoids introducing unnecessary errors. Second, we maintain the high-resolution representation in the multi-resolution convolution network, enabling multi-scale fusions to exchange information across parallel multi-resolution subnetworks, rather than through connections of high-to-low resolution subnetworks in series. These features differentiate our approach from most existing mesh convolution networks and enable more accurate mesh dense predictions, which is confirmed in experiments.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper considers 3D mesh dense prediction tasks such as instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, monocular depth estimation, human pose estimation, and shape correspondence, which are often required in geometric modeling and analysis. In the past decade, deep learning has achieved remarkable success in various 2D/3D applications, including dense predictions in computer graphics and vision. Some well-known networks such as AlexNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, VGG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> and ResNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> have been developed. However, dense predictions are position-sensitive and often require element-level predictions, making classical network architectures that first encode the input data into low-resolution representations unsuitable for these tasks. Therefore, new architectures and strategies are needed to achieve accurate dense predictions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">There are typically three approaches to generating high-resolution representations for images using convolutional neural networks (CNN). The first approach involves a high-to-low and low-to-high process, which recovers high-resolution features through upsampling operations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> and skip-connections <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. The second approach is to build an image pyramid with pyramid pooling modules <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> or atrous spatial pyramid pooling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. The pyramid features are then fused to generate high-resolution representations. The third approach maintains high-resolution channels through the high-to-low and low-to-high process, together with repeated multi-scale feature fusion modules, which produces representations with rich semantic meaning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> and has been reported to achieve state-of-the-art dense prediction performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Applying and extending CNN frameworks for 3D mesh dense prediction is a tempting idea, but the irregular structure of 3D meshes presents a challenge. Basic CNN operators, such as convolution, pooling, and unpooling, need to be specifically designed to work with non-grid structures.
Recently, some approaches have been proposed to mimic CNN networks, such as MeshCNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> and PDMeshNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, which utilize sequential edge collapses to produce a lower-resolution mesh. However, the selection of edges for collapse depends on specific learning tasks, and training samples may have specific regions that never collapse. This may raise the requirement for diversity of training data and increase the complexity of training networks. Another approach,
SubdivNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, proposes to remesh the irregular input mesh into a semi-regular structure with subdivision sequence connectivity. However, this approach applies the network operators to the remeshed model instead of the original mesh, making the method dependent on the remeshing results.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Thus one question arises: <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">can we construct a neural network defined directly on irregular mesh data whose local receptive fields can grow uniformly after each convolution, pooling, or unpooling layer</span>? Though the terms “irregularity” and “uniformity” seem contradictory, this paper provides a positive answer to this question. In particular, to achieve top-down and bottom-up propagation, we first create a multi-resolution mesh using mesh simplification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. To address the challenge of performing basic network operations on the irregular connectivity of a triangular mesh, we construct bijective piecewise linear surface-to-surface maps between meshes of adjacent levels, inspired by inter-surface mapping <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Specifically, we map each triangle of a coarse mesh to a “curved” triangle on the fine mesh. The curved triangle consists of polygonal pieces on the fine mesh, which we can use to design area-aware pooling/unpooling and face convolution layers. For example, in the pooling layer, we merge all the polygonal pieces associated with a curved triangle into one, and the contribution of each polygonal piece is proportional to its area.
The key to our approach is that the inter-surface mapping <em id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">redefines</em> the input mesh rather than <em id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">reshaping</em> it. This provides guidance for feature propagation without introducing approximation errors or worrying about the irregularity of the input data.
Furthermore, we control the triangle quality during the construction of the multi-resolution mesh, as described in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, to ensure that the triangles in each level have similar shapes.
Additionally, we can constrain the surface-to-surface maps to minimize significant distortion. As a result, the local receptive fields of our network have a relatively fixed pattern and expand uniformly during the layer-by-layer pass, similar to powerful 2D CNNs. Finally, we propose to maintain the high-resolution representation in the multi-resolution convolution network, which enables multi-scale fusion to exchange information across parallel multi-resolution subnetworks and avoids loss of information in the high-to-low process.
The overview of our approach is illustrated in Figure. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Self-Parameterization Based Multi-Resolution Mesh Convolution Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A surface mesh is composed of vertices, edges, and faces.
Geometric deep learning methods perform convolution in local Euclidean neighborhoods based on the connectivity of vertices or the topology of surfaces.
Various convolution operations have been designed. The methods that perform convolution on vertices consider the spatial relations of vertices using Cartesian, polar or spherical coordinates, and define weights between vertices accordingly.
Early approaches focused on adapting grid CNNs to irregular graph data. GCNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> proposed building a local geodesic system in polar coordinates for each node and discretizing neighboring nodes into a fixed number of bins to handle nodes without a fixed number of neighbors. MoNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> represented the learnable convolution kernel in 3D space using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), while SplineCNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> extended MoNet with a more flexible convolution kernel that uses B-spline basis functions in a geometric space, providing more learnable parameters compared to previous methods.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Face-based methods incorporate topological features into mesh faces and use an aggregation mechanism to combine neighboring face features. MeshNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> introduced a face rotation convolution block that applies the convolution kernel to three pairs of corner vectors, combining the results with MLP layers to ensure invariance to the order of corner vectors. Another method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> defines two types of convolutions based on geodesic and Euclidean distances to improve the convolution results. SubdivNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> remeshes the input mesh into Loop subdivision connectivity to enable four adjacent faces to be pooled into one face. It also introduces an order-invariant face convolution and a mesh pooling operation. Instead of using the geometric descriptor, Laplacian Mesh Transformer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> uses Laplacian spectral decomposition to describe the connectivity of triangles, and employs dual attention mechanism to define the message propagation process.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In edge-based convolution, MeshCNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> defines convolution operators directly on edges, leveraging the consistent neighboring structure of edges in a triangular mesh. MeshWalker <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> extracts shape features by walking randomly along mesh edges to sample subgraphs for learning. PD-MeshNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> constructs both a primal and a dual graph, enabling the assignment of features to edges and faces as well.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">For dense prediction tasks on meshes, adapting existing 2D CNN techniques, such as high-resolution representation recovery and multi-resolution fusion, is an appealing idea. However, defining multi-scale representations on meshes is non-trivial due to their irregular and non-uniform characteristics. Clustering methods, such as Graclus pooling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> (also called greedy node clustering) and diff-pool <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, have been proposed for graph pooling. Although these techniques work well for some undirected graphs, they may not preserve the manifold structure, resulting in undesirable outcomes.
One possible solution is to re-design the pooling operation, for instance, using dynamic edge collapse operations which generate a coarse surface, as demonstrated in MeshCNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> and PD-MeshNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. These methods record the indices and positions of the collapsed edges, which can be used to perform upsampling via vertex split operations and thus to adapt CNN dense prediction networks such as U-Net. However, they may result in non-uniform downsampling of edges. Another solution is to build multi-resolution mesh pyramids through remeshing, as shown in SubdivNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> and Neural Subdivision <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. These methods first decimate the input mesh to a base mesh and then construct a semi-regular connectivity by subdividing the base mesh. The semi-regular structure allows for the natural extension of operators in CNN. However, these methods heavily rely on the quality of the remeshing results.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">2.2 </span>Inter-surface Mapping</h3>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Inter-surface mapping is to create a continuous and bijective surface-to-surface map between two triangle meshes with the same topology. Existing methods can be roughly divided into two categories according to whether they need some intermediate domains or not. The first category employs a unit disk or sphere as the intermediate domain, with each triangular mesh parameterized on this domain. The inter-surface map is then defined as the composite of separate parameterizations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. As
these methods cannot be directly applied to surfaces with different topologies, cut/transition processes are required <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, which adds extra steps.
Recently, constant-curvature metrics have been employed to optimize the end-to-end map without cuts, providing a solution for surfaces with arbitrary genus <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>.
The second category uses local optimization to generate a continuous map between discrete surfaces with arbitrary topology <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. However, this approach is difficult to generate globally optimal maps and also requires either solving a complicated optimization problem or introducing additional processing such as designing cuts, making it time-consuming and difficult to handle large-scale and multi-class datasets.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Here we present a simple and efficient approach that is based on MAPS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. The mesh pyramid can be generated through various implementations, which can either rely on vertex removal or edge collapse. We opt for an implementation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> that utilizes QEM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> to steer edge collapse in a more balanced way, while disregarding collapses that could result in triangle flips. This helps prevent the production of overly thin or excessively large triangles. Specifically, we repeat the following steps to obtain the subsequent level and corresponding map, using the current mesh.</p>

The network maintains the input high-resolution mesh across its stages to obtain spatially precise dense prediction results. The network consists of 4 stages (indicated by the dashed line boxes), each of which comprises multiple parallel convolution blocks and multi-resolution fusion blocks. In the parallel convolution block, features are propagated independently along each resolution level. In the multi-resolution fusion block, the high-resolution data are downsampled, and the low-resolution data are upsampled. The different resolution representations are fused by summation to enable information exchange between different resolution levels.</figcaption>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We are now ready to present our network. It takes high-resolution mesh data as input and aims to learn high-level representations for each face, which can benefit downstream dense prediction tasks. Specially, we utilize the mesh pyramid with bijective surface-to-surface maps to design both high-to-low and low-to-high face feature aggregation schemes that provide similar functionality to pooling and unpooling operations in 2D CNNs. Moreover, we define an order-invariant face-based convolution aggregating neighbor information through layers. With flexible downsampling, upsampling, and convolution operations, we adapt powerful CNN dense prediction architectures <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> to irregular 3D surface meshes, thus enabling dense prediction tasks on meshes using SPMM-Net (see Figure. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 4 SPMM-Net ‣ Self-Parameterization Based Multi-Resolution Mesh Convolution Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>).

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Multi-resolution fusion exchanges information between different resolution levels, which is frequently used in learning architectures for 2D dense prediction. The low-resolution features are likely to contain global semantic information, and high-resolution features are sensitive to local geometry and precise spatial positions. By combining these information, the fused features would be semantically richer and spatially more precise, which thus benefits the downstream tasks.</p>

We conducted evaluations on dense prediction for meshes, including mesh segmentation and shape correspondence. We also performed comparisons of our approach with the state-of-the-art and assessed the key components of our network. The results provide convincing evidence of the superior performance of our framework in accomplishing these tasks.</p>

Since our method targeted dense prediction tasks, we required the input mesh to contain more than 10,000 faces. Additionally, the input mesh should be watertight, so we utilized hole-filling algorithms to repair meshes that contain holes or boundaries. Subsequently, we constructed a set of multi-resolution meshes and a collection of bijective surface-to-surface maps using the method described in Section 3.

We observe that our method better preserves the human shape and results in higher segmentation accuracy. Notably, the shoulders of the model underwent significant changes in the base mesh generated by MeshCNN’s pooling method, leading to a drop in segmentation accuracy in this region.</p>

The shape correspondence task in these works refers to the task of labeling each vertex of the input shape to the corresponding vertex of the reference shape. The Faust dataset contains 100 processed scanned human body shapes with ten different poses. Each shape has 6890 nodes and 13776 faces. The first 80 shapes from the dataset are used for training and the rest 20 shapes for testing. The ground truth of the dataset is given implicitly, as each shape has the same connectivity. We took the original meshes as input and constructed the mesh pyramids with number of faces equals to 3444, 861, and 216, with downsampling rate equals to 4.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p2.2" class="ltx_p">As our SPMM-Net deals with the face element, we formulated the correspondence problem as a face labeling task, where each face was assigned a 13776-dimensional vector as ground truth.
We employed the HRNetV2p-W48 architecture for this pretty dense task, meaning the resolution level 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th contains 48, 96, 192, 384 convolution channels, respetively. We used the area-weighed downsampling and barycentric upsampling for feature fusion, and employed a soft error loss <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>. For each input mesh, we first calculated the geodesic distance between the centers of any pair of triangle faces, then, for predictions that are geodesically far away from the correct face, we punished them stronger.

The first experiment focused on evaluating the impact of image dense prediction architectures on 3D mesh learning. To this end, we implemented and compared two popular architectures for image segmentation, namely U-Net and HRNetv2. Our results indicate that HRNetv2 outperforms U-Net in 3D mesh learning, similar to the image tasks.</p>

We built 4-level mesh sequences with loop connectivity using the method mentioned in the paper, resulting in the same resolution data (16384 faces) as input.

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We have presented SPMM-Net, a novel deep learning framework designed for 3D meshes to address dense prediction tasks. Behind SPMM-Net are the construction of a multi-resolution mesh pyramid, incorporating sequential bijective mapping relationships, the design of flexible and robust downsampling/upsampling and convolution operations for irregular high-resolution meshes, and the design of the multi-resolution network that maintains high-resolution representations throughout the network.
The key feature of our approach is the bijective inter-surface mapping that redefines meshes, rather than simply reshaping them.
Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the proposed framework can effortlessly adapt to existing CNN architectures
and learn robust face features for dense prediction tasks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Though our network exhibits flexibility with respect to the connectivity of the input mesh, we require the mesh to be manifold so that the self-parameterization algorithm can be applied. Also, it should be pointed out that the quality of input meshes and the choice of self-parameterization methods impact the pooling and unpooling results. Another limitation of our method is that it does not support some CNN operations such as strided convolution and dilated convolution. We hope to extend our work to overcome these issues in future.</p>
