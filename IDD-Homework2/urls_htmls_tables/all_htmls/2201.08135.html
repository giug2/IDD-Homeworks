<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Federated learning is a machine learning paradigm that emerges as a solution to the privacy-preservation demands in artificial intelligence. As machine learning, federated learning is threatened by adversarial attacks against the integrity of the learning model and the privacy of data via a distributed approach to tackle local and global learning. This weak point is exacerbated by the inaccessibility of data in federated learning, which makes harder the protection against adversarial attacks and evidences the need to furtherance the research on defence methods to make federated learning a real solution for safeguarding data privacy. In this paper, we present an extensive review of the threats of federated learning, as well as as their corresponding countermeasures, attacks versus defences. This survey provides a taxonomy of adversarial attacks and a taxonomy of defence methods that depict a general picture of this vulnerability of federated learning and how to overcome it. Likewise, we expound guidelines for selecting the most adequate defence method according to the category of the adversarial attack. Besides, we carry out an extensive experimental study from which we draw further conclusions about the behaviour of attacks and defences and the guidelines for selecting the most adequate defence method according to the category of the adversarial attack. This study is finished leading to meditated learned lessons and challenges</span>.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Data-driven machine learning methods currently dominate artificial intelligence. This reliance on data allows us to stand out three artificial intelligence challenges. The former is the preservation of data privacy, since artificial intelligence methods process personal and sensitive data, such as health <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> and financial data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Likewise, the growing interest in data privacy safeguarding is reflected in emerging legal frames such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. The second challenge is related to the increasing availability of data, which, on the one hand, is furthering the progress of artificial intelligence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, and, on the other hand, it arises new challenges related to its storage and processing that are even exacerbated when data stemmed from distributed sources, as in IoT scenarios <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. The latter challenge emerges from the need to distributively process data when it is not possible to transfer it to a central server, because of legal or regulatory restrictions, communication costs or other kind of technical limitations. Due to this distributed scenario, new difficulties appear linked to dissimilar data distributions from the same domain and the likely large size of data sources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm proposed as a possible response to the three previous challenges, and especially for the demand of preserving data privacy, together with a distributed approach to tackle local and global learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. FL aims at generating a collaboratively trained global learning model without sharing the data owned by the distributed data sources. Frequently, it requires a coordinator agent, which is in charge of managing the information exchange required to train the global learning model. In this way, the data is protected from unauthorised access, either by other data sources or the coordinator party.</span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Machine learning is vulnerable to adversarial attacks mainly focused on impairing the learning model or violating data privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Likewise, FL is exposed to the same jeopardy, since it is an specific machine learning setting. Some of those attacks are grounded in the maliciously manipulation of the training data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, which are inaccessible in FL and, then, we cannot rely on the use of data inspection techniques for detecting that altered data. Therefore, one of the weak points of FL is being exposed to adversarial attacks that may violate the integrity of the learning model or the privacy of data.</span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">The evidence that adversarial attacks are a weak point of FL is built upon the fact of the large volume of publications centred on the identification of vulnerabilities in the form of adversarial attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, and on the corresponding large volume of defence proposals against to those attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. This effervescent quantity of publications is the cause of the publication of several survey works on adversarial attacks that attain to review and summarise the latest papers related to this weak point. These surveys lack of an holistic view of FL and the review of the defences against adversarial attacks, because of the following reasons: 
<span id="S1.I1" class="ltx_inline-enumerate">
<span id="S1.I1.i1" class="ltx_inline-item"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_inline-item"><span id="S1.I1.i1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">(1)</span></span> <span id="S1.I1.i1.5" class="ltx_text">most of them are only focused on one kind of adversarial attacks, namely there are surveys reviewing attacks to the federated model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> or privacy attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, but any of them encompass both sort of attacks; </span></span>
<span id="S1.I1.i2" class="ltx_inline-item"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_inline-item"><span id="S1.I1.i2.1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">(2)</span></span> <span id="S1.I1.i2.5" class="ltx_text">the vast majority does not include any experimental study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, so it is not possible to compare the strength of the attacks and the robustness of the defences in a common evaluation framework; and </span></span>
<span id="S1.I1.i3" class="ltx_inline-item"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_inline-item"><span id="S1.I1.i3.1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">(3)</span></span> <span id="S1.I1.i3.5" class="ltx_text">by default they only focus on horizontal FL ignoring vertical and federated transfer learning.</span></span>
</span></span></p>

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Due to the mentioned facts, we propose a new survey on FL threats, and additionally we provide several taxonomies on adversarial attacks and defences, an experimental study and a final discussion about lessons learned and challenges.

These data distributions are mainly relevant to HFL<span id="S2.SS1.SSS0.Px4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">.

When the attack is carried out by one of the participants in the distributed system, either one or more clients, or the server, it is known as an insider attacker. Clearly, the scope of the two attacks is very different: insider attacks <span id="S2.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">are more harmful</span> and may be aimed at modifying the behaviour of the model or inferring valuable information from other clients, while those carried out by outsiders are usually aimed only at inferring information about the data or the resulting learning model. Outsider attacks mainly focus on sniffing information of the communication channels between the involved agents. They are either side-channel attacks, when the attacker gains information from the implementation of the FL scenario, or man-in-the-middle attacks, when the attacker intercepts the communication channel by disguising herself as the receiver part. Both attacks are related to the protocols used to establish communication and their implementation.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.SSS0.Px2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Regarding insider attacks, <span id="S2.SS3.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">in HFL</span> it is natural to differentiate between two types of attacks, depending on whether they are carried out by a client or by a server. The main point of difference lies in the amount of information available. While the attacks carried out by clients only have information of one or several clients, the server holds information about the model architecture and the updates of the clients in each round of learning. Even, in cryptographic implementations of the federated communication among the federated server and the clients, the server owns more information than the clients<span id="S2.SS3.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">,</span> as it is the only one with enough knowledge to <span id="S2.SS3.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">decipher</span> the models.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.SSS0.Px3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In centralised settings, the white-box attacker has full access to the target model, including the model architecture, the parameters and its internal state. In contrast, the black-box attacker does not have any access to the target model and additionally, she might have some additional information about the architecture of the target model or its training procedure. These two classifications of attacker knowledge are too general to represent every type of attacker<span id="S2.SS3.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">,</span> because there is no middle ground to consider attackers whose knowledge in the black box setup is too restricted<span id="S2.SS3.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">,</span> and in the white box setup is not enough constrained. To address this issue, a grey-box attacker was introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, which is a black-box attacker with some specific statistical knowledge not publicly available that concerns her victim. This description of attacker knowledge is tailored for a centralised learning setting, and as a consequence it does not fit other learning settings as the attack surface changes. In a FL system, white-box, grey-box or black-box attackers can be any <span id="S2.SS3.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">node, either the clients or the server</span>. Moreover, the exposed attack surface is greater than in centralised settings. Most attacks are related to the data owned by the clients and the communication among the federated server and the clients, therefore, we also require including <span id="S2.SS3.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">the information available regarding the federated training process</span> and to the client’s private data.

Due to this wide variety in the nature and target of attacks, it is difficult to establish a common taxonomy for all types of adversarial attacks.

This fact makes the adversarial attacks to the federated model become one of the most significant challenges in FL.</span></p>

In some situations attackers are considered to have access to more white-box information, for example about the aggregation mechanism used on the server, which is not a realistic situation. We therefore highlight those attacks that only require information from the adversarial client.</span></p>

In other words, a backdoor attack is successful as long as it succeeds in preserving its performance in the original task while injecting a second task. These attacks are very stealthy, since they generally do not affect the performance of the original task <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, which makes them hard to detect. <span id="S3.SS1.SSS2.Px1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Note that although they do not pose a danger to the FL main task, they do represent a danger to the integrity of the system, since the attacker takes advantage of the federated infrastructure to perform a certain backdoor action, representing a security breach.</span>

The pattern can be any image, for example cartoon images or randomly generated patterns. The main limitation is that this mechanism requires to modify the entire sample during both training and testing, which may not be feasible.</p>

Unlike the previous one, this attack consists of modifying part of the training data samples. The poisoning can be of different types, such as including patterns in the samples and associate it with some target class, or normalizing the samples and adding uniform noise with the aim of impairing the performance of the model. In recent years, the use of Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite> to generate these poisoned samples has become popular, to maximize the target of the attack on the one hand<span id="S3.I3.i2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">, and on the other hand,</span> to maximize the disguise of the attack to overcome the possible defences of the server on the other <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite>. A further clear example is the case of the attack proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>]</cite>, which consists in: (1) the attacker first behaves as a benign client and trains a GAN to mimic prototypical samples of other benign clients and, then, (2) the attacker generates the poisoned samples using these generated samples in order to compromise the global model by sending scaled poisoning updates as their local model updates.</p>

For example, it is widely used to attack specific defences by introducing new criteria to be optimized <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> in order to overcome defences discarding conditions <span id="S3.I5.i2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">specific to each defence</span>. In addition, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite> they also prove that regularization techniques decrease the impact of <span id="S3.I5.i2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">the training data</span> in the resulting model. For that reason, they propose to train adversarial clients without any regularization mechanism in order to increase the impact of the poisoned samples. <span id="S3.I5.i2.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">This kind of attack is probably the most efficient approach to perform targeted attacks on the model.</span></p>

It consists in the fact that certain clients are coordinated in such a way that they know common rules and by modifying small parts of the model weights they can communicate. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite> is proposed to adjust the training data strategically so that the weight of a particular dimension in the global model will show a pattern known by the rest of the malicious clients.

[<a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>]</cite> put forward a novel attacker model aiming at turning FL systems into covert channels to implement a stealth communication infrastructure by means of modifying certain bits of the models.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Privacy attacks are designed to disclose information about the participants of a machine learning task. Not only they pose a threat to the privacy of the data used to train the machine learning models, they also pose a privacy risk to those people who agreed to share their private data. FL was thought of as a privacy preserving distributed machine learning paradigm, however the learning process exposes a broad attack surface. While the private data never leaves their owner, the exchanged models are prone to memorization of the private training dataset. <span id="S3.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">In this section, we present a wide taxonomy which aims to ease the understanding the diversity of privacy attacks. It is designed around the objective of the privacy attacker, a summary of it is shown in Figure <a href="#S3.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 3.2 Privacy attacks ‣ 3 Adversarial Attacks in Federated Learning: Taxonomies ‣ Survey on Federated Learning Threats: concepts, taxonomy on attacks and defences, experimental study and challenges" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>.</span></p>

The latter gathers the assumption that the target client and the attacker share a label, so that the inference can occur on a non-shared target label.

[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> propose an attack with active and passive versions, each one with two options for attacker knowledge. The attack can have either client-side knowledge or server-side knowledge, where the latter is the most powerful one. Their attack consist in training a meta-classifier on the hidden layers output, the gradients, and outputs of the target client model. Such meta-classifier is a neural network with a custom architecture suited for each part of the internal state of the victim model. <span id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">In the federated setting, the attack is not as effective as in the centralised scenario, so two techniques are introduced to boost the effectiveness of the attack. The first one is known as Gradient Ascent. It consists in nullifying the effect of the gradient descent on the instances used to test the attack. As a result, it broadens the difference between the data points used to train the victim model and the data points not used to train the victim model. The second one is known as Client Isolation. The objective of this technique is overfitting the victim model by not sharing with the victim client the global learning model, that is, isolating the victim client from any update. Overfitting makes the victim model retain more information about its training dataset.</span></p>

Although it was a promising proposal, the main problem is that in the presence of a non-IID distribution of data between clients it could fail to identify clusters. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Andreina et al. [<a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>]</cite>, they experiment with different anomaly detection mechanisms and combine the results with adaptive clipping and noise. Along the same lines, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Sattler et al. [<a href="#bib.bib97" title="" class="ltx_ref">97</a>]</cite> the authors propose to divide the model updates into clusters according to the cosine distance and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Preuveneers et al. [<a href="#bib.bib98" title="" class="ltx_ref">98</a>]</cite> proposed an incremental defence based on unsupervised deep learning anomaly detection system integrated in a blockchain process. In a similar vein, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Hei et al. [<a href="#bib.bib99" title="" class="ltx_ref">99</a>]</cite> proposed an alert filter identification module in the blockchain FL process. Also in a blockchain domain, HoldOut SGD is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib100" title="" class="ltx_ref">100</a>]</cite>, which uses the holdout estimation technique in order to select the model updates that are likely to be adversarial ones. It consists in selecting two groups of clients: (1) the ones that use their private data to training in order to send their model updates and (2) a voting committee that use their private data as holdout data <span id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">for selecting</span> the best model update proposals using a voting scheme. This Graph-based anomaly detection has also been proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite>, where the authors propose Sniper, a defence mechanism built upon the graph whose vertices are the updates of the local models and the edges exists only if the two vertices are close enough. They finally identify benign local models by solving a maximum clique problem in this graph. Another example is <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Nguyen et al. [<a href="#bib.bib101" title="" class="ltx_ref">101</a>]</cite>, where the authors propose an anomaly based system based on a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and test it on Internet of Things (IoT) specific databases. Along the lines of using deep learning to detect anomalies, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Zhao et al. [<a href="#bib.bib102" title="" class="ltx_ref">102</a>]</cite> employ GANs by using partial classes data to reconstruct the prototypical samples of client’ training data for auditing the accuracy of each client’s model.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The main problem with anomaly-based approaches is that the model updates are likely to be very high dimensional, coming from neural networks in most cases. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Tolpegin et al. [<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>, they propose to apply Principal Components Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction before anomaly detection. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Li et al. [<a href="#bib.bib103" title="" class="ltx_ref">103</a>]</cite> they also propose a spectral anomaly detection, which detects abnormal model updates based on their low-dimensional embeddings. The main idea is to embed both original and poisoned samples into a low-dimensional latent space and find these that differs significantly. Although these approaches reduces the problem to a low-dimensional problem, they have the limitation of losing information during the dimensionality reduction.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Another defence approach in the literature against adversarial attacks to the federated model is based on the fact that original task knowledge will be located in most of the weights in the model, while the weights affected by poisoning attacks will be a small portion of them. Based on this assumption, a post-training defence is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib109" title="" class="ltx_ref">109</a>]</cite>, which consists of pruning the resulting global model in order to protect it against attacks that may have taken place during training. Specifically, the authors design a federated pruning method to remove redundant neurons from the neural network and to adjust the outliers of the model. They propose two pruning approaches based on majority vote and ranking vote. The main limitation is that it is usually necessary to perform fine-tuning afterwards on a validation set to compensate for the loss of accuracy caused by pruning.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">These defences cover the space of secure implementations of FL. They enable multiple clients or parties to perform a global task, assuming the presence of some malicious actors that try to deter it. For our purposes, such actors can be embodied as the attackers that perform some adversarial attacks mentioned before. While the privacy of inputs of the global computing task is preserved, the output is revealed to some parties, if not all. Therefore, the privacy of the output is not assured, although some privacy attacks are stopped because the attacker loses access to the intermediate outputs of the global task such as the parameters or gradients shared by the clients. In other words, these defences are capable of reducing server-side knowledge to partial server-side knowledge, given that the server can only access the aggregated model or the aggregated gradients.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) protocols are tightly related to Secure FL (SFL) protocols <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib131" title="" class="ltx_ref">131</a>]</cite>. Note that We refer to SFL protocols as FL protocols that attains the security in the simulation-based framework used to formalize the notion of security <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib132" title="" class="ltx_ref">132</a>, <a href="#bib.bib133" title="" class="ltx_ref">133</a>, <a href="#bib.bib134" title="" class="ltx_ref">134</a>]</cite>. SMPC rely on Homomorphic Encryption (HE) as a key component to provide security. Consequently, HE can be regarded as the building blocks of any SMPC protocol. It provides multiple cryptographic primitives which allows for secure computations such as Secret Sharing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib135" title="" class="ltx_ref">135</a>]</cite>, Zero Knowledge Proofs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib136" title="" class="ltx_ref">136</a>]</cite> and Garbled Circuits <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib137" title="" class="ltx_ref">137</a>]</cite>. Most HE based protocols only support single key encryption, which might pose a risk if the key is compromised, that is, a single point of failure. This situation has been addressed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib138" title="" class="ltx_ref">138</a>, <a href="#bib.bib139" title="" class="ltx_ref">139</a>]</cite>, where the authors have developed SFL systems with multiple encryption keys.</p>

As a consequence, the idea of full-fledged SMPC protocols that involve the entire federated training procedure are abandoned in favour of SMPC protocols that involve the communication steps in FL. As a remarkable example, a key step in HFL protocols, where SMPC protocols can ensure security and efficiency, is the aggregation step. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Bonawitz et al.

<div id="S5.SS1.SSS1.Px1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.SSS1.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">If we compare the effectiveness of the attack in function of the type of attack, we conclude that the most damaging attack is the random weights attack. In fact, this attack <span id="S5.SS1.SSS1.Px1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">manages to totally confuse the federated model, to the extent that it behaves as a most frequent label classification model.</span> If we focus on the data-poisoning attacks, we get that the label-flipping attack is sightly more effective than the out-of-distribution attack. This is probably because the <span id="S5.SS1.SSS1.Px1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">label-flipping attack</span> learns miss-labelled samples from within the distribution, while the <span id="S5.SS1.SSS1.Px1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">out-of-distribution attack</span>, theoretically, only adds error to samples from outside the distribution.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS1.SSS1.Px1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.SSS1.Px1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Regarding the ratio of adversarial clients participating in each aggregation, we found that there are significant differences, being the most effective one carried out by a single adversarial client (1-out-of-30). While this may seem contradictory, there is an explanation. When the attack is carried out by several clients, the boosting factor is divided among these adversarial clients. This divides <span id="S5.SS1.SSS1.Px1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">the strength of the attack among all the adversarial clients, which thus weak the power of the attack</span>, whereas when carried out by a single client, all the boosting is reflected in a single attacker, making it more effective.</p>

<h5 class="ltx_title ltx_title_paragraph">Behaviour of the defences</h5>

<div id="S5.SS1.SSS1.Px2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.SSS1.Px2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As a general rule, the defences that best mitigate the effect of the attacks are Multikrum (20) and Bulyan (f=5), with MultiKrum (20) standing out slightly. As we have <span id="S5.SS1.SSS1.Px2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">shown</span>, although Bulyan is presented as an improvement of MultiKrum in combination with trimmed-mean, if the pre-selected clients are benign clients, this truncation is not necessary and even superfluous. On the other hand, the more basic defences such as median and trimmed-mean show good enough behaviour in some experiments, even outperforming MultiKrum and Bulyan with some parameters.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS1.SSS1.Px2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.SSS1.Px2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">This superiority of the most basic defences over MultiKrum and Bulyan with <span id="S5.SS1.SSS1.Px2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">specific parameters values evidences</span> the high dependence of these defences on <span id="S5.SS1.SSS1.Px2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">the values of the input parameters. This behaviour matches with the assertion of the authors of MultiKrum and Bulyan, they are the most robust defences with the optimal value of the input parameters. This dependency on the values of the input parameters represents an obstacle for the use of this defences, since the value of some parameters is difficult to know, like the number of adversarial clients</span>. A clear example of this problem is Bulyan (f=1) in the random weights Byzantine model-poisoning attack, whose results are comparable to using no defence at all by filtering out too few adversarial clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS1.SSS1.Px2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.SSS1.Px2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To conclude, untargeted attacks are highly effective, especially those based on model-poisoning, which achieve random behaviour in the federated model. The defences proposed in the literature perform reasonably well, substantially improving the effect of the attacks, even the simplest ones. However, none of them manage to completely dissipate the attack, and the best-performing ones are highly dependent on configuration parameters, so there is still <span id="S5.SS1.SSS1.Px2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">room for improvement</span> in designing defences against Byzantine attacks.</p>

If we analyse the state-of-the-art defences (Weak DP and RLR), we found the results to be appropriate, but perhaps a mite disappointing on a complexity-performance trade-off compared to the other defences.

<p id="S5.SS1.SSS2.Px1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To conclude, input-instance-key backdoor attacks are considerably powerful, performing better in the backdoor task than in the original one, but being too eye-catching and detrimental to the original task.

We implement the attacks by randomly selecting the adversarial clients and poisoning some of their samples with different patterns. In particular, we use the following patterns of different levels of difficulty according to the number of pixels: (1) one single black pixel for Federated MNIST, (2) a red cross of length 4 for Fashion MNIST (8-pixel pattern) and (3) a white pixel in each of the corners of the image (4-pixel pattern) for CIFAR-10. We evaluate both the effectiveness and the stealthiness of the attack. We measure the stealthiness of the attack by means of the mean accuracy obtained in the original task (Original). We also evaluate the effectiveness of the attack in terms of two <span id="S5.SS1.SSS2.Px2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">additional</span> tests: (1) Backdoor, which contains the poisoned samples of the adversarial clients and (2) Test, which represents the test of the backdoor task and is composed of test samples poisoned following the specific pattern. Therefore, an attack will be more effective the higher performance it obtains in both the original and the backdoor task, while a defence will be better if it manages to maintain the performance in the original task while decreasing as much as possible the performance in the backdoor task.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.SSS2.Px2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Regarding the behaviour of the defences, we also obtain a substantial improvement with respect to the scenario without any defence with all of them. As in the untargeted attacks, the simplest defences obtain competitive results, even outperforming the most complex defences in some situations. In general, deciding which defence is superior is not a trivial task. Since it is a matter of achieving the best trade-off between performance in the original task and dissipation of the backdoor attack. For example, RLR achieves in Federated EMNIST the best defence against <span id="S5.SS1.SSS2.Px2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">the</span> attack<span id="S5.SS1.SSS2.Px2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">, but it</span> is more detrimental to performance on the original task.

<p id="S5.SS1.SSS2.Px2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To conclude, pattern-key backdoor attacks are highly threatening attacks, as they achieve almost 100% success in the backdoor task, without, in most cases, harming the performance of the original task. Defences manage to dissipate the effect of the attack in the backdoor task, but in most cases impair performance in the original task. Therefore, in this case, the key is to find the trade-off between mitigating the attack and not harming the performance of the model.</p>

[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, which represents a small population of clients with big amounts of sensitive data such as banks or hospitals, willing to jointly train a privacy preserving deep learning model. As each client owns great quantities of data, some records can be duplicated among them, that is, the dataset owned by each client is sampled uniformly with replacement from the following datasets: EMNIST, Fashion MNIST and CIFAR-10. Consequently, each of them is divided between 4 clients and each client owns a sample of half the size of the entire dataset, sampled with replacement.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Each federated task is run for 300 rounds where each client shares her local model after each local training epoch, the attacker observes the rounds: 50, 100, 200, 250 and 300. The attack is trained for 100 epochs and the model with best testing accuracy is selected. The attacker training dataset is made of 4000 random samples belonging to each attacked client, 4000 random samples which do not belong to any client and each one is labelled according to its membership to the attacked client. For all the experiments, the batch size is set to 32.

We also highlight that the Gradient Ascent technique does not bring significant performance improvements, probably because it is hard to calibrate. While in the MNIST dataset we <span id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p4.1.4" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">see</span> that the attack is not successful, in the other the membership of some instances is revealed, so there is a privacy leak, although it is very small.</p>

As noted before, the Gradient Ascent technique degrades the accuracy of the federated task, mainly due to the fact that some of the instances which were ascent belong to the federated test set. While this is true for the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets, it is not true for the CIFAR-10 dataset. It might be because of the transfer learning approach used for this dataset being more resilient to gradient direction changes. As expected, DP based defences reduce the accuracy of the federated task. The smallest reduction of federated task accuracy is achieved with the CIFAR-10 dataset, which confirms that the transfer learning approach is more resilient to gradient changes, moreover the Gradient Ascent technique does not change significantly the accuracy when applied.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">In this experimental study, we have explored the performance of a Membership inference attack on a federated setting of few clients with big amounts of data. We have found that the success of the attack is small, even though the membership of some instances was revealed. The DP based defence stopped these leakages of privacy, at the cost of a considerable reduction of the federated task accuracy. Additionally, we have found that using a transfer learning approach might reduce the impact of DP in the federated task accuracy while also being resilient to the Gradient Ascent technique which have drastically reduced the federated task accuracy with the other datasets and deep learning approaches.</p>

The same is not true for CIFAR-10, as more complex models are required to achieve a reasonable accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib171" title="" class="ltx_ref">171</a>, <a href="#bib.bib172" title="" class="ltx_ref">172</a>]</cite>. EMNIST and Fashion-MNIST images are hard to reconstruct after 1 training epoch, that is, the gradients after 1 training epoch leak little information about the datasets. An example of such difficulties is shown in Figure <a href="#S5.F11" title="Figure 11 ‣ 5.2.2 Experimental study of Feature inference attacks ‣ 5.2 Privacy attacks ‣ 5 Experimental study ‣ Survey on Federated Learning Threats: concepts, taxonomy on attacks and defences, experimental study and challenges" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a>. In contrast, in CIFAR-10 the training model takes longer to converge and the gradients leaks a lot of information, even after 10 epochs of training. The main reason that allow us to understand this behaviour is the fact that both attacks try to mimic the structure and content of the shared gradient (that is, minimizing the MSE between the shared gradient and the reconstructed image), so the more information is stored in the gradient, the easier is the reconstruction process. In other words, gradients that <span id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p8.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">more significantly</span> change the weights of the model make the reconstruction process easier. This is not true for the attack from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>]</cite>, as its objective is to minimize the cosine similarity between gradient vectors.</p>

While the addition of Gaussian noise of this magnitude is known to reduce the performance of the task <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, the gradient compression defence can handle higher compression rates without significantly hurting performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib173" title="" class="ltx_ref">173</a>]</cite>. When it comes to the attack of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Geiping et al. [<a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>]</cite>, we find that the Gaussian noise defence is as effective as in the other attacks. This might be due to the differentially private properties of the Gaussian noise. However, the Gradient compression defence fails to completely stop the attack of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Geiping et al. [<a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>]</cite>. Specially for the Fashion-MNIST dataset, where almost half of the times the attack succeeded. An example of a reconstruction trial with and without defences is shown in Figure <a href="#S5.F12" title="Figure 12 ‣ 5.2.2 Experimental study of Feature inference attacks ‣ 5.2 Privacy attacks ‣ 5 Experimental study ‣ Survey on Federated Learning Threats: concepts, taxonomy on attacks and defences, experimental study and challenges" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">12</span></a>, it gives an hint of the behaviour of the attack. Gradient compression is the worst performing defence, probably due to the fact that compressing the gradient does not affect the task of minimizing the cosine similarity between the shared and the reconstructed image gradient.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p13.1" class="ltx_p">In conclusion, the Feature inference attacks studied in this section pose a high risk to privacy, as there are many attacks that succeed at extracting private information from gradients. Luckily, there are defences that can thwart the success rate of the attacks and provide privacy without changing significantly the performance of the trained model. However, this is not true for all the analysed attacks, there is still room for improvement as the attack from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Geiping et al. [<a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>]</cite> seems to be able to escape them in some situations. Additionally, this threat is not only related to FedSGD scenarios, it is also related to federated scenarios where parameters are exchanged between clients.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Due to the large number of attacks identified, and the wide variety of defences proposed in the literature, it can be difficult to choose which type of defence is appropriate for each situation. Moreover, most defences are designed with the objective of defending against a particular adversarial attack. However, as a collateral benefit, they can prevent the success of other types of adversarial attacks.</span></p>

<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S8.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Regarding the previous lessons learnt, we identified the following challenges that the field will have to face up in the next years.</span></p>
</div>
<section id="S8.SS0.SSS0.Px1" class="ltx_paragraph">
<h5 class="ltx_title ltx_font_bold ltx_title_paragraph">Defences vs. attacks</h5>

<div id="S8.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">An identified trend is that for each defence proposed, it is possible to <span id="S8.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">identify a vulnerability that can be turned into an adversarial attack</span>, and vice versa. Therefore, one of the biggest challenges is to find both: (1) <span id="S8.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">all vulnerabilities present in a FL scenario that an attacker could exploit</span>, and (2) a defence effective enough to defend against any attack. For the time being, this seems a long way off, as the different perspectives from which both problems have been approached are ad hoc to the type of attack to be <span id="S8.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">identified</span> or defended. From our point of view, the study of defences is <span id="S8.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">crucial</span>, since the final goal is to achieve a secure<span id="S8.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">, robust</span> and private learning environment. Along this vein, the optimal defence will be the one that combines the best proposals in each of the categories, in such a way that it manages to defend against all types of attacks while maintaining performance in the original task. There are existing approaches that combine client’s filtering with noise addition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, although there is still a long way to go.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="S8.SS0.SSS0.Px2" class="ltx_paragraph">
<h5 class="ltx_title ltx_font_bold ltx_title_paragraph">Trade-off in defences</h5>

<div id="S8.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In most defences, we find that it is difficult to strike a trade-off between preventing the model from attacking and not impairing performance in the original task. For example, in those based on DP, we find that in order to ensure data privacy, a large amount of noise has to be added, which significantly impairs the performance of the model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib105" title="" class="ltx_ref">105</a>]</cite>. <span id="S8.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Therefore one of the main challenges would be the development of more efficient DP methods, and the extension of DP to defences against all adversarial attacks.</span> This situation also occurs in defences based on client filtering when more clients than necessary are filtered out, thus losing information in the aggregation process. In short, it is difficult to strike a trade-off between preventing an attack and not losing or poisoning the information received by clients.</p>

<section id="S8.SS0.SSS0.Px3" class="ltx_paragraph">
<h5 class="ltx_title ltx_font_bold ltx_title_paragraph">Non-IID assumptions</h5>

<div id="S8.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The non-IID nature of the training data distributed among clients often makes it difficult to differentiate between adversarial clients and those who have had a very <span id="S8.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">different from the rest</span>, but still valuable, learning process. One <span id="S8.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">common approach</span> is to use anomaly detection algorithms suitable for non-IID distributions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib174" title="" class="ltx_ref">174</a>]</cite> or approaches which not rely on data distribution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib109" title="" class="ltx_ref">109</a>]</cite>, however, there are still problems in differentiating between clients with a highly skewed distribution and adversarial clients in most cases.</p>

<section id="S8.SS0.SSS0.Px4" class="ltx_paragraph">
<h5 class="ltx_title ltx_font_bold ltx_title_paragraph">Generalised FL</h5>

<div id="S8.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The vast majority of adversarial attacks <span id="S8.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">have been identified</span> for HFL. In particular, the adversarial attacks to the federated model. Although there is already existing work on privacy attacks in VFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib77" title="" class="ltx_ref">77</a>]</cite>, <span id="S8.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">there is still a long way to go in identifying and analysing the vulnerabilities in terms of leakage of information of attacker possibilities in other categories of FL wich are becoming widely used such as VFL or FTL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib175" title="" class="ltx_ref">175</a>]</cite></span>. Therefore, we believe that in the coming years, work on <span id="S8.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">identifying</span> attacks for VFL and FTL <span id="S8.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">and the research in defences against them</span> will take centre stage.</p>

<section id="S8.SS0.SSS0.Px5" class="ltx_paragraph">
<h5 class="ltx_title ltx_font_bold ltx_title_paragraph">Combination with other trends</h5>

<div id="S8.SS0.SSS0.Px5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.SS0.SSS0.Px5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">While ensuring data privacy is one of the main goals of FL, there are other desirable features. For example, some of the most popular trends are Personalised FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib176" title="" class="ltx_ref">176</a>]</cite> or fairness in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib177" title="" class="ltx_ref">177</a>]</cite>. We believe that, at the end of the day, data security and privacy must be a requirement in all other approaches. Therefore, several future works will address this issue as a cross-cutting objective while developing proposals for more concrete desirable features. For example, a method of personalised FL that is secure against adversarial attacks.</p>

<p id="S9.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S9.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">FL emerges as a solution to the computational costs and privacy-preserving demands of the most groundbreaking ML. However, this new learning paradigm brings new challenges, particularly in terms of adversarial attacks and defending against them. Hence, several proposals of new adversarial attacks or adaptations of centralised ones as well as defences ad hoc to these attacks have been proposed in the recent years.</span></p>

<p id="S9.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S9.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">We proposed several taxonomies according to different criteria that eases the knowledge of the wide field of FL threats. In addition, we conducted an extensive experimental study which leads us to propose a guidelines for the application of defences against adversarial attacks, and to highlight a set of lessons learned and challenges related to FL threats.</span></p>

<p id="S9.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S9.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">We conclude that the study of FL threats is an ongoing field of research, due to its importance in ensuring FL as a robust machine learning paradigm that safeguards data privacy. There are still several challenges to be faced and directions to be studied in order to identify additional threats (or vulnerabilities) of FL, as well as the appropriate mechanisms to make it a resilient and robust learning paradigm against those threats.</span></p>
