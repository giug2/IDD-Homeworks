<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) has recently become one of the hottest focuses in wireless edge networks with the ever-increasing computing capability of user equipment (UE). In FL, UEs train local machine learning models and transmit them to an aggregator, where a global model is formed and then sent back to UEs. In wireless networks, local training and model transmission can be unsuccessful due to constrained computing resources, wireless channel impairments, bandwidth limitations, etc., which degrades FL performance in model accuracy and/or training time. Moreover, we need to quantify the benefits and cost of deploying edge intelligence, as model training and transmission consume certain amount of resources. Therefore, it is imperative to deeply understand the relationship between FL performance and multiple-dimensional resources. In this paper, we construct an analytical model to investigate the relationship between the FL model accuracy and consumed resources in FL empowered wireless edge networks. Based on the analytical model, we explicitly quantify the model accuracy, available computing resources and communication resources. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our theoretical modeling and analysis, and demonstrate the trade-off between the communication and computing resources for achieving a certain model accuracy.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Edge intelligence is boosted by the unprecedented computing capability of smart devices. Nowadays, more than 10 billion Internet-of-Things (IoT) equipment and 5 billion smartphones have emerged that are equipped with artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered computing modules, such as AI chips and graphic processing units (GPUs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. On the one hand, the user equipment (UE) can be potentially deployed as computing nodes to support emerging services, such as collaborative tasks, which paves the way for applying AI in wireless edge networks. On the other hand, in the paradigm of machine learning (ML), the powerful computing capability on these UEs can decouple conventional ML from acquiring, storing, and training data in data centers as conventional methods.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) has recently been widely acknowledged as one of the most essential enablers to bring edge intelligence into reality, as it facilitates collaborative training of ML models, while enhancing individual user privacy and data security <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. In FL, ML models are trained locally, therefore raw data remains in the device. Specifically, FL uses an iterative approach that requires a number of global iterations to achieve a certain global model accuracy. In each global iteration, UEs perform several local iterations to reach a local model accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. As a result, the implementation of FL in wireless networks can also reduce the costs of transmitting raw data, relieve the burden on backbone networks, and reduce latency for real-time decisions, etc.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.2" class="ltx_p">While FL offers these attractive and valuable benefits, it also faces many challenges, especially when being deployed in wireless edge networks. For example, both local training and model transmission can be unsuccessful due to constrained resources and unstable transmission. Moreover, different from the conventional ML approaches, where raw datasets are sent to a central server, only the lightweight model parameters (<em id="S1.p3.2.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e.</em>, weights, gradients, etc.) are exchanged in FL. Nevertheless, the communication cost of FL could be still fairly large and cannot be ignored. The experimental results in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> show that the model size of a 5-layer convolutional neural network used for MNIST (classification) is about 4.567MB per global iteration for <math id="S1.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="28\times 28" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p3.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">28</mn><mo lspace="0.222em" rspace="0.222em" id="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">×</mo><mn id="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">28</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p3.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1"><times id="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.1"></times><cn type="integer" id="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.2">28</cn><cn type="integer" id="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.3">28</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p3.1.m1.1c">28\times 28</annotation></semantics></math> images, while the model size of ResNet-110 used for CIFAR-10 (classification) is around 4.6MB per global iteration for <math id="S1.p3.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="32\times 32" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p3.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S1.p3.2.m2.1.1" xref="S1.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S1.p3.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S1.p3.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">32</mn><mo lspace="0.222em" rspace="0.222em" id="S1.p3.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S1.p3.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">×</mo><mn id="S1.p3.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S1.p3.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">32</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p3.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S1.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p3.2.m2.1.1"><times id="S1.p3.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p3.2.m2.1.1.1"></times><cn type="integer" id="S1.p3.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S1.p3.2.m2.1.1.2">32</cn><cn type="integer" id="S1.p3.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S1.p3.2.m2.1.1.3">32</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p3.2.m2.1c">32\times 32</annotation></semantics></math> images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Therefore, before deploying FL empowered wireless edge networks, we need to answer two fundamental questions: (1) How accurate of an ML model can be achieved by using FL, and (2) How much cost is incurred to guarantee certain required FL performance? Obviously, answering these two questions is of paramount importance for facilitating edge network intelligence. Therefore, we need to deeply understand the relationship between FL performance and consumed multi-dimensional resources.</p>

We first derive the distribution of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), signal-noise ratio (SNR), model transmission success probability, and resource consumption. Then, we evaluate the impact of the amount of resources on FL performance. Numerical results validate the accuracy of our theoretical modeling and analysis.

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Currently, there has been a large body of work on developing various FL algorithms for FL empowered wireless edge networks. The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> designed an appropriate user selection scheme to minimize FL convergence time and training loss by jointly optimizing user selection and resource block allocation. The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> proposed a collaborative FL framework to enable UEs to implement FL with less reliance on a central server by aggregating the local FL models received from the associated UEs. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, the authors presented a Stackelberg-game-based approach to develop an FL incentive scheme by modeling the incentive-based interaction between a global server and participating UEs. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, we proposed a hybrid FL scheme to make a global UE association decision for heterogeneous models by exploiting two levels of model aggregation. All aforementioned investigations aimed to facilitate edge intelligence by developing suitable FL algorithms in wireless edge networks. However, the authors have not explicitly addressed the resource cost under FL framework. In fact, the communication cost under FL framework could be still fairly large and cannot be ignored, although only the lightweight model parameters are exchanged.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To support these improved FL algorithms even the legacy FL algorithms, resource-efficient and FL performance guarantee are indispensable basis for achieving the FL empowered wireless edge intelligence. The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> developed a low-cost sampling-based algorithm by adapting various control variables to minimize cost components (<em id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g.</em>, learning time, energy consumption). In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, the authors considered a multivariate control problem for energy-efficient FL to guarantee convergence by designing principles for different optimization goals. The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> proposed an over-the-air computation based approach to improve communication efficiency by modeling joint device selection and beamforming design as a sparse and low-rank optimization problem. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, the authors introduced update-importance-based client scheduling schemes to reduce the required number of model training rounds by selecting a subset of clients for local updates in each round of training. The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> proposed a convergent over-the-air FL scheme to reduce bandwidth and energy consumption by inducing precoding and scaling upon transmissions to gradually mitigate the effect of the noisy channel. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed a federated dropout scheme to enable FL on resource-constrained devices by tackling both the communication and computation resource bottlenecks. All these investigations aimed to achieve resource-efficient FL algorithms in wireless edge networks. However, the vulnerability of wireless links is largely ignored, which directly degrades FL performance by affecting local training and model transmission. Therefore, deeply understanding the relationship among FL performance, wireless factors, and multi-dimensional resources is essential for enabling wireless edge intelligence.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">So far, there has been little attention on quantifying the relationship between FL performance and consumed resources, while considering the vulnerability of wireless links.

However, they have not considered the unsuccessful model transmission in a real network. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, the authors studied a joint learning and communication optimization scheme to minimize an FL loss function, where the limited resources and unstable wireless links were considered.

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We consider an FL empowered wireless edge network consisting of a central base station (BS) and multiple UEs, as shown in Fig.1. The UEs can be regarded as local computing nodes for local model training, while the server (<em id="S3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g.</em>, edge servers) serves as the model aggregator co-located with the BS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. To quantitatively present the FL empowered wireless network model, we need to model the distribution of the UEs and arrival rate of the interfering UEs. As one of the most commonly used point processes, PPP model has been widely used to model UEs distribution and/or arrival rate of the interfering UEs in wireless networks, where a huge amount of data has validated the accuracy of the model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A certain amount of wireless bandwidth is consumed in the uplink/downlink, when models are exchanged between the BS and the UEs. Specifically, in the uplink, the UEs send their local models to the BS via some channel partitioning schemes, such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). in the downlink, the BS sends the global model to individual UEs. Indeed, the wireless transmission environment of the uplink/downlink will affect the transmission process of the local/global model, and thus affect the global aggregation and local training. In this section, we theoretically analyze SINR, SNR, as well as wireless bandwidth consumed in the uplink/downlink to support FL empowered wireless edge networks.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We assume the processing capacity of all UEs are constant in cycles/sample. Moreover, as different ML models pose different degrees of complexity, we assume all UEs train the same FL task in our analytical model, where the local ML models have the same size and structure. Therefore, the total amount of computing resources needed to support local model training for all UEs is affected by the number of training UEs as well as the amount of datasets on the UEs. On the one hand, the number of training UEs is affected by the wireless transmission of the global model. On the other hand, many of the existing studies explicitly indicate that the amount of different datasets distributed on the UEs is imbalanced, as the data is collected directly and stored persistently <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. Note here data imbalance means the different amount of local datasets, instead of different dataset contents, so our analytical model is based on i.i.d. data, where non-i.i.d data case is left for future work. Therefore, we theoretically analyze computing resources consumption for supporting local training from the perspective of SNR and imbalanced datasets in this section.</p>

Therefore, we assume the amount of datasets on each UE is fixed to facilitate the proof of Proposition 3. In addition, from Proposition 2 and Proposition 3, we can see that there is a trade-off between the number of communication rounds and the number of local iterations characterized by <math id="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\epsilon_{l}" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1a"><msub id="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">ϵ</mi><mi id="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">l</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.2">italic-ϵ</ci><ci id="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑙</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1c">\epsilon_{l}</annotation></semantics></math>: small <math id="S5.SS2.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\epsilon_{l}" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.p2.2.m2.1a"><msub id="S5.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">ϵ</mi><mi id="S5.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">l</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.p2.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S5.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.2">italic-ϵ</ci><ci id="S5.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.3">𝑙</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.p2.2.m2.1c">\epsilon_{l}</annotation></semantics></math> leads to large <math id="S5.SS2.p2.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\tau" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.p2.3.m3.1a"><mi id="S5.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.cmml">τ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.p2.3.m3.1b"><ci id="S5.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1">𝜏</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.p2.3.m3.1c">\tau</annotation></semantics></math>, yet small <math id="S5.SS2.p2.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="K" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.p2.4.m4.1a"><mi id="S5.SS2.p2.4.m4.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.p2.4.m4.1.1.cmml">K</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.p2.4.m4.1b"><ci id="S5.SS2.p2.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p2.4.m4.1.1">𝐾</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.p2.4.m4.1c">K</annotation></semantics></math>, from which we can jointly approximate the communication and computing resources consumed by training FL tasks.

In this section, we discuss three specific cases for different sufficiency of communication and computing resources. Furthermore, we derive the explicit expression of the model accuracy under FL framework, as a function of the amount of the consumed resources based on the sufficiency of respective communication and computing resources.</p>

In this case, the number of local iterations still follows Proposition 2, as computing resources are sufficient.

As communication resources are sufficient, the number of communication rounds still follows Proposition 3, while Proposition 2 may not be met due to the lack of computing resources, which decreases the number of local iterations. As a result, the required local model accuracy cannot be achieved.

Specifically, the analytical results of computing resource consumption is computed based on equation (19), while the simulation results are averaged over 10 randomly generated point distributions for each UE density. Fig. 7 shows the computing resource consumption changes with the density of UEs. From Fig. 7, we can see that the amount of computing resource consumption increases in the beginning and then decreases with the density of UEs.

From Fig. 13, we can see that the local model accuracy quickly increases in the beginning and then keeps fairly steady with the amount of computing resources. The reason is similar to that in Fig. 12, <em id="S7.SS2.SSS3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e.</em>, more computing resources leads to more local iterations in the beginning, while sufficient computing resources have little effect on local iterations. Please note the fluctuations of the curves in the Fig. 13 are due to that the local model accuracy in the Fig. 13 is recorded per local iteration, while the global accuracy in the Fig. 12 is recorded per communication round composed of 30 local iterations.</p>

<p id="S7.SS2.SSS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, we examine the trend of the global model accuracy with respect to the amount of computing resources and the amount of bandwidth. Fig. 14 shows the relationship among the global model accuracy, computing resources, and bandwidth, where the trade-off between the amount of computing resources and the amount of bandwidth is verified. As shown in Fig. 14, both the amount of bandwidth and the amount of computing resources affect the global model accuracy, where we can flexibly adjust the amount of computing resources and the amount of bandwidth to guarantee a specific global model accuracy. Specifically, when we fix the amount of bandwidth used for transmitting the local models, we can increase the global model accuracy by increasing the amount of computing resources. When we fix the amount of computing resources used for local training, we can increase the global model accuracy by increasing the amount of bandwidth.</p>

<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Wireless edge network intelligence enabled by FL has been widely acknowledged as a very promising means to address a wide range of challenging network issues. In this paper, we have theoretically analyzed how accurate of an ML model can be achieved by using FL and how many resources are consumed to guarantee a certain local/global accuracy. Specifically, we have derived the explicit expression of the model accuracy under FL framework, as a function of the amount of computing resources/communication resources for FL empowered wireless edge networks. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our theoretical modeling. The modeling and results can provide some fundamental understanding for the trade-off between the learning performance and consumed resources, which is useful for promoting FL empowered wireless network edge intelligence.</p>
