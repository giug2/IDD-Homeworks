<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Recent advances in machine learning, wireless communication, and mobile hardware technologies promisingly enable federated learning (FL) over massive mobile edge devices, which opens new horizons for numerous intelligent mobile applications. Despite the potential benefits, FL imposes huge communication and computation burdens on participating devices due to periodical global synchronization and continuous local training, raising great challenges to battery constrained mobile devices. In this work, we target at improving the energy efficiency of FL over mobile edge networks to accommodate heterogeneous participating devices without sacrificing the learning performance. To this end, we develop a convergence-guaranteed FL algorithm enabling flexible communication compression. Guided by the derived convergence bound, we design a compression control scheme to balance the energy consumption of local computing (i.e., “working”) and wireless communication (i.e., “talking”) from the long-term learning perspective. In particular, the compression parameters are elaborately chosen for FL participants adapting to their computing and communication environments. Extensive simulations are conducted using various datasets to validate our theoretical analysis, and the results also demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme in energy saving.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The growing prevalence of mobile smart devices and the rapid advancement of social networking applications result in the phenomenal growth of the data generated at the edge network. To draw useful information from such geographically distributed data, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm that allows participating users to collaboratively learn a shared model, while keeping all the private training data on their edge devices. In particular, all the participants are allowed to run stochastic gradient descent (SGD) locally and send the intermediate gradients to the server periodically for global synchronization. The recent advances in mobile edge computing further facilitate the implementation of FL in mobile networks, since modern smart mobile devices are now armed with high-performance central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) to handle intensive computations of intelligent applications. With the technical advantages and implemental feasibilities, FL has seen recent successes in several applications, including next word prediction in Google’s Gboard <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, vocal classifier for “Hey Siri” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, mobile augmented reality <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, etc.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, to practically deploy FL in wireless networks still faces several critical challenges. On the one hand, both transmitting the gradient updates and performing the local optimizations are resource-hungry, leading to considerable energy consumption at mobile edge devices during the training process. Despite improving computing capacity, mobile edge devices are generally subject to the limited battery lifetime, which hinders their applications in training complex models and supporting continuous learning. On the other hand, the mismatch between the heavy communication loads and the constrained wireless bandwidth hampers the efficient exchange of locally computed updates. The current trend of going deeper in the depth of neural networks has resulted in high-dimensional models with millions of parameters, which inevitably involves significant wireless traffic in global model synchronization. Things can only worsen when considering the heterogeneity of communication environments across different devices, where the learning efficiency may severely depend on a few stragglers with poor channel conditions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Several pioneering works have been done to manage system resources for efficient FL in wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. However, these studies overlooked reducing resource consumption intrinsically from the learning algorithm’s perspective, hindering a substantial performance boost in resource utilization and training efficiency. A promising solution suggested in recent works in distributed learning is to incorporate state-of-the-art communication compression strategies into FL algorithms, which can considerably reduce the communication cost with little impacts on learning outcomes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Yet the existing compressed distributed learning algorithms and the corresponding convergence analysis typically require identical compressor across all the participants, which ignores the heterogeneity in participants’ communication capacity and thereby exhibits less flexibility. More importantly, this line of works mainly focuses on alleviating communication burdens in FL. However, the ever-increasing deployment of 5G networks that provides data rates as high as 1Gbps has shown a great potential to eliminate the communication bottleneck in FL, let alone the forthcoming 6G revolution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. For example, to transmit a Resnet-50, a commonly used deep network for image classification, with approximately 100MB parameters via 1Gbps wireless links typically consumes 0.16J, which is comparable to the energy consumption of performing a single-step local training on one GPU (e.g., 0.2J for NVIDIA Tesla V100 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>). In light of this fact, it is worthwhile to investigate the impacts of both “working” (i.e., local computing) and “talking” (i.e., wireless transmission) and strike a balance between them via flexible compression control.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In designing a compression control scheme, we would like to communicate as few times and bits as possible to reduce the communication cost. At the same time, we attempt to incur as little distortion to the gradient information as possible towards fast convergence. However, these two goals are fundamentally in conflicts since deeper compression will naturally lead to more distortion on the gradients and more potential communication rounds to converge. When taking energy consumption of edge devices as the measure, this can be further interpreted as follows: Compressing the gradients severely and performing single-step local updates all the time could minimize the energy consumption per communication round. This may require extra communications to attain the targeted model accuracy, or even make the model fail to converge, and thereby impair the overall energy efficiency.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To tackle the challenges above, in this work, we study to improve the energy efficiency of FL over heterogeneous mobile edge devices. Considering the heterogeneous environments across participating wireless edge devices, we propose a flexibly compressed learning algorithm integrating local computation, gradient sparsification, error compensation, and batch size increment. Based on the convergence rate of the algorithm, we develop a compression control scheme that adapts the compression parameters to minimize all the devices’ energy consumption on computing and communication.

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FL over wireless networks has recently gained tremendous attention, whose system design is entangled with training acceleration, network optimization, and on-device resource allocation. Recognizing the limited computing and communication resources at edge computing systems, Wang et al. in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> dynamically controlled the frequency of global synchronization to minimize the learning loss in real-time adapting to the resource budget. By exploring the unique properties of wireless multiple-access channels, Yang et al. in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> developed a fast model aggregation approach with joint device selection and beamforming design, which considers only one communication round, and thus cannot guarantee the long-term training performance. To accelerate the training process, Chen et al. in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> scheduled the participants of high significance for model uploading per communication round while allocating the uplink wireless resources properly. Capturing the trade-off between training time and participants’ energy consumption, authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> formulated optimization problems to jointly allocate the computing and communication resources by considering the heterogeneity of environments. While properly managing the system resources to enable FL in mobile edge networks, these studies overlook reducing resource consumption intrinsically in the essence of learning algorithm itself, thus hindering the substantial boost in training efficiency and resource utilization.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Some recent efforts on distributed learning algorithm design have been devoted to mitigating the communication bottleneck, which can be categorized into two directions: communication round reduction and communication traffic reduction. Specifically, McMahan et al. in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> proposed the FedAvg algorithm (also known as local SGD) to reduce the frequency of global synchronization, which allows every participant to perform multiple local SGD iterations in a communication round, other than communicating after every local iteration. Authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> used dynamically increasing batch sizes in distributed SGD to reduce the required number of communication rounds. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, a momentum SGD method was adopted to accelerate the convergence where the involved communications during training can be reduced accordingly. To reduce the traffic per communication round, one could let each participant communicate the compressed gradients rather than raw gradients for every global synchronization. For example, sparsified SGD studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> followed the idea that only a small subset of gradients with large magnitude are required to upload. Quantized SGD studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> allowed each participant to quantize the gradients into low-precision values before sending. Despite reduced communication complexity, the huge computing cost remains hinder FL on resource-constrained edge devices. Besides, most of the current gradient sparsification methods require identical sparsity levels across all the participants, ignoring the heterogeneity of participants and thereby exhibiting less flexibility. This work fills this gap by redesigning the compressed-federated learning algorithm with flexible and well-controlled compression parameters (e.g., global synchronization frequency and gradient sparsity). Simultaneously, heterogeneous computing and communication environments of participants are jointly considered to make the compression strategy suitable for mobile edge networks in practice.</p>

This indeed helps to accommodate stragglers with poor channel conditions and thus mitigates the impacts of stale updates. Besides, FT-LSGD-DB novelly incorporates error compensation and batch size increment into FL procedures, which are two effective methods adopted and verified by practitioners recently. Specifically, error compensation is used to accelerate the global convergence by accumulating the error that arises from only uploading sparse approximations of the gradient updates, which ensures all gradient information does get eventually aggregated <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Using dynamically increasing batch sizes during training can maintain the known convergence rate with fewer communication rounds <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.

Fueled by the recent advances in mobile hardware technology, GPU has become a ubiquitous hardware accelerator integrated virtually in every smart device to offer significantly more compute power. A typical GPU chip includes a multi-core GPU module and an associated GPU memory module where the voltage and frequency of GPU cores and GPU memory can be controlled separately.

To minimize the energy consumption in single global iteration, one will severely compress the gradient tensor and decide to perform a single-step local update all the time, which would greatly impact the convergence rate and increase the number of global synchronizations. As a result, total energy consumption may increase considerably. In practice, the participants with excellent communication environments are expected to adopt slight gradient compression schemes for accelerating the convergence, while the others with poor channel conditions should be allowed to sparsify the gradients more severely to save the energy. In light of this, global update frequency and gradient sparsity should be carefully determined by considering the heterogeneity of participants for achieving energy-efficient FL.</p>

Notice that we omit the examination of “<span id="S5.p2.10.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">SynSgdSpars</span>” in this setting since it performs so poorly that it is incomparable to the other schemes. Thanks to the flexible compression, our proposed scheme, as we would expect, exhibits more resilience than the others to cope with the scenario with high heterogeneity across participants in terms of wireless channel conditions.</p>

This also implies that temporal sparsity has a more profound impact on convergence rate than gradient sparsity in our setting. Due to delayed synchronization and imprecise gradient information, both “<span id="S5.p4.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">UnifiedSpar</span>” and “<span id="S5.p4.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FlexibleSpar</span>” are shown to slow down the convergence at initial, which is consistent with our convergence analysis.

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we have presented a holistic communication compression solution to reduce the energy consumption of FL over heterogeneous participating edge devices without sacrificing the model accuracy. We have developed a FL algorithm enabling flexible communication compression and provided the convergence analysis from a theoretical perspective. Considering the heterogeneous computing and communication conditions across edge devices, we have further designed an energy-efficiency oriented compression control scheme guided by the derived convergence bound. Extensive simulations have been conducted to verify the theoretical analysis and evaluate the algorithm’s performance. The results have shown that our flexibly compressed FL scheme exhibits great potentials in accommodating heterogeneous mobile edge devices and improving the energy efficiency of FL over those edge devices.</p>
