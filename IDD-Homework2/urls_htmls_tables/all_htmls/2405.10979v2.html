<h6 class="ltx_title ltx_title_abstract">Abstract</h6>
<p class="ltx_p" id="id1.1">Wearable data serves various health monitoring purposes, such as determining activity states based on user behavior and providing tailored exercise recommendations. However, the individual data perception and computational capabilities of wearable devices are limited, often necessitating the joint training of models across multiple devices. Federated Human Activity Recognition (HAR) presents a viable research avenue, allowing for global model training without the need to upload users’ local activity data. Nonetheless, recent studies have revealed significant privacy concerns persisting within federated learning frameworks. To address this gap, we focus on investigating privacy leakage issues within federated user behavior recognition modeling across multiple wearable devices. Our proposed system entails a federated learning architecture comprising <math alttext="N" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" id="id1.1.m1.1"><semantics id="id1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="id1.1.m1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">N</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1">𝑁</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id1.1.m1.1c">N</annotation><annotation encoding="application/x-llamapun" id="id1.1.m1.1d">italic_N</annotation></semantics></math> wearable device users and a parameter server, which may exhibit curiosity in extracting sensitive user information from model parameters. Consequently, we consider a membership inference attack based on a malicious server, leveraging differences in model generalization across client data. Experimentation conducted on five publicly available HAR datasets demonstrates an accuracy rate of 92% for malicious server-based membership inference. Our study provides preliminary evidence of substantial privacy risks associated with federated training across multiple wearable devices, offering a novel research perspective within this domain.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p1.1">In recent years, with technological advancements, there has been a continuous reduction in the size of chips and storage devices while their performance has steadily improved. This trend has propelled the enhancement of computational capabilities in wearable devices such as smartwatches, leading to their widespread applications across various domains <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.10979v2#bib.bib1" title="">1</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.10979v2#bib.bib2" title="">2</a>]</cite>. Typically embedded with sensors like accelerometers and gyroscopes, these wearable devices collect real-time data and monitor users’ health status. For instance, Human Activity Recognition (HAR) technology utilizes sensor data to identify human activities. Many smartphone manufacturers have introduced smart wristbands and watches with diverse functionalities, commonly equipped with motion recognition capabilities to automatically identify users’ physical activities. The realization of these features relies on HAR models trained through Machine Learning to recognize user movements.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p2.1">As the number of devices like smartwatches grows, so does the volume of data, making data privacy protection increasingly crucial. Traditionally, in HAR research, data collected by devices were often uploaded to servers for model training, with manufacturers integrating pre-trained models into devices before sale. However, this centralized data collection approach poses risks of data leakage. With numerous data breach incidents, data providers are increasingly averse to their privacy being compromised. Hence, since the proposition of federated learning by the Google team <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.10979v2#bib.bib3" title="">3</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.10979v2#bib.bib4" title="">4</a>]</cite>, researchers have begun adopting federated learning for HAR model training. Federated learning mitigates the risk of data leakage during data upload to servers, as individual participants only need to upload their trained models. Moreover, by utilizing federated learning to train HAR models, enterprises can distribute training tasks among many different participants. Under the premise of privacy protection, these participants are more inclined to use federated learning for model training as they do not wish to compromise privacy when uploading data to servers. For HAR applications, federated learning undoubtedly presents a viable solution, avoiding data leakage during participant data upload to servers, with original data stored locally and model training conducted locally.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p3.1">However, several studies have indicated that even for pre-trained models, there remains a risk of privacy leakage. For example, Shokri et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.10979v2#bib.bib5" title="">5</a>]</cite> addressed the privacy risks inherent in machine learning as a service (MLaaS) by proposing Membership Inference Attack (MIA). MIA can infer whether an individual is included in the dataset used to train the target model, posing severe privacy risks to individuals. In many machine learning applications, the source of training data also carries privacy risks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.10979v2#bib.bib6" title="">6</a>]</cite>. For instance, suppose there is a medical dataset used to train a model for predicting certain diseases. Attackers may use MIA to determine if a specific individual is in the dataset. For example, if the model predicts a person’s medical condition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.10979v2#bib.bib7" title="">7</a>]</cite>, attackers may use MIA to determine if that person’s data is in the training set, thereby obtaining their medical privacy information. In the field of speech recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.10979v2#bib.bib8" title="">8</a>]</cite>, attackers may use membership inference attacks to determine if someone’s voice data was used to train the model. If attackers successfully determine that someone’s data is in the training set, they may infer the person’s voice characteristics and other privacy information. A report by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) specifically mentions that determining whether MIA infers an individual’s inclusion in the dataset used to train the target model is a confidential act <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.10979v2#bib.bib9" title="">9</a>]</cite>. Moreover, such privacy risks caused by MIA may lead commercial companies intending to provide MLaaS services to violate privacy regulations.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p4">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p4.1">Therefore, this paper investigates the joint modeling process of multiple wearable devices aimed at user behavior recognition, with a focus on analyzing the privacy leakage issues associated with wearable data. Our analysis reveals significant differences in HAR data among different users. When employing joint modeling with multiple wearable devices, the prediction vector distributions of different users in each other’s models differ substantially from their own models. This prompts an analysis of their privacy risks. Assuming the attacker as a curious server in federated learning possessing a certain amount of client data and partial knowledge of their sources, the objective is to distinguish data owned by but not attributed to any client. Hence, we explore the privacy risks present in the HAR model training process in federated learning. For the server, the training data from various clients are invisible, but during training, the models uploaded by individual clients are visible. By inputting known member and non-member data into the models uploaded by clients, the attacker obtains prediction vector distributions on the model and trains an attack model to distinguish data sources, known as Membership Inference Attack (MIA). MIA typically requires training data of the model, but in our approach, it only requires knowledge of which client the data belongs to, as the HAR models trained by clients usually generalize well to their own data but poorly to other clients’ data. We conducted experiments on five publicly available HAR datasets under various conditions and observed the accuracy and recall rates of the attack model, demonstrating its ability to effectively differentiate remaining data with high accuracy.</p>

HAR stands as a significant research domain within artificial intelligence and signal processing, aiming to utilize data collected from various sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes to identify and classify human activities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.10979v2#bib.bib10" title="">10</a>]</cite>. HAR finds applications in diverse fields, including health monitoring, fall detection, and smart homes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.10979v2#bib.bib11" title="">11</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.10979v2#bib.bib12" title="">12</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.10979v2#bib.bib13" title="">13</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.10979v2#bib.bib12" title="">12</a>]</cite>. Typically, HAR data is directly collected from sensors affixed to the human body, thereby increasing the potential risk of privacy exposure once malicious actors gain access to the data. Traditional HAR methods often rely on centralized data from different users or devices to train global models. However, this centralized approach raises concerns regarding privacy, security, and scalability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.10979v2#bib.bib14" title="">14</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S2.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.p2.1">In the traditional machine learning paradigm, collected data is usually uploaded to servers for model training. However, this method of uploading datasets to servers poses numerous potential risks of data leakage. For instance, incidents of data privacy breaches, such as those observed in companies like AOL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.10979v2#bib.bib15" title="">15</a>]</cite>, have made both enterprises and individuals reluctant to easily upload their data to servers for model training, leading to the emergence of the so-called <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S2.p2.1.1">data islands</span> issue. The introduction of federated learning technology partially addresses this problem. Federated learning involves training models on client devices using local data and then uploading model parameters, losses, gradients, and other information to servers, which then aggregate these parameters to obtain a global model. This training approach allows client devices to avoid uploading local data to servers, effectively mitigating potential risks of data leakage during the upload process. With the advent of federated learning technology, researchers have begun exploring how to utilize federated learning to train HAR models, addressing issues such as data privacy leaks and data islands.</p>

In many cases, federated learning addresses non-iid problems. However, there may exist varying privacy risks among the client devices involved in model training. In real-world application scenarios, HAR data collected from different individuals may exhibit differences due to individual habits, resulting in variations in the magnitude and posture of actions performed when executing the same activity. For instance, as depicted in Figure <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_label ltx_ref_self">LABEL:fig:harth_c1_c2_walking</span>, the sensor data signals on the back in the <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S2.p3.1.2">walking</span> activity data from subject 1 and subject 2 in the HARTH dataset exhibit significant differences despite representing the same activity. Consequently, due to the disparities in HAR data from different individuals, when training models using data from a single subject, the features learned by the trained model originate predominantly from that individual. As illustrated in Figure <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.10979v2#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ II Motivation ‣ Private Data Leakage in Federated Human Activity Recognition for Wearable Healthcare Devices"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, when training the model using only subject 1’s data, the highest confidence in prediction vectors is consistently close to 1, and the distribution of data is similar. When subject 2’s data is input into the model trained with subject 1’s data, the highest confidence in the prediction vectors is only occasionally close to 1, with significant differences in the distribution of prediction vectors compared to those obtained from subject 1.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.p4.1">For attackers, the aforementioned disparities in output distributions of HAR data between different subjects on the model serve as valuable aids in determining the data source. Specifically, considering the scenario of federated learning involving two clients, each possessing HAR data from different individuals, attackers, upon acquiring HAR data, would attempt to input this data into models trained by clients to obtain corresponding prediction vectors and observe the distribution of these data. Leveraging the knowledge obtained from the aforementioned process, attackers can identify data most likely to belong to the client that uploaded the model with prediction vectors exhibiting the highest confidence close to 1. Subsequently, attackers may gather additional privacy information through the application scenarios of the trained model or the hardware information of the client device itself.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S3.SS2.p1.1">With the proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT), wearable devices such as smartwatches are equipped with various sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes, which can be used for activity detection. The combination of these sensors enables activity recognition through smartwatches, and HAR is increasingly used for identifying activities in daily life  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.10979v2#bib.bib16" title="">16</a>]</cite>. The emergence of federated learning allows application developers or research institutions interested in training HAR models to collaborate with different HAR data owners, treating them as participating clients in federated learning to jointly train models. However, there are also malicious attackers who attempt to explore the privacy information of participating clients by training models. Attackers, with access to their own data, can invite data owners to train HAR models and simultaneously train attack models during the process. They use the attack models to determine the origin of subsequently obtained data.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.SS3.p1.1">The data in Table <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.10979v2#S4.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ IV-C HAR Model Performance ‣ IV Experiment Results ‣ Private Data Leakage in Federated Human Activity Recognition for Wearable Healthcare Devices"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a> reflect the average accuracy of five HAR datasets on the training and testing sets under different model conditions. These results suggest that after federated learning aggregation, the models exhibit similar accuracy on the training and testing sets, indicating that the models do not overfit the training data but demonstrate good generalization ability. In MIA, attackers can infer whether data participated in training by judging the degree of overfitting of the model to the training data. The higher the degree of overfitting, the better the attack effectiveness. Preliminary experiments indicate that models trained on individual client HAR datasets have very good generalization performance to their own data. For data from the same client, regardless of whether it participated in training, the model’s prediction distribution is generally similar. However, there may be differences in the generalization ability of the model to data from different clients. Each client only has good generalization ability to its own data, and the confidence in predicting data from other clients is lower, especially when model training aggregation is not performed. This phenomenon emphasizes the heterogeneity of client data in federated learning and needs to be fully considered during the model aggregation process.</p>

In fact, the results also indicate that adding defense mechanisms only has a certain impact on the performance of the attack model in the initial few epochs of training. After the attacker uploads the trained model from each target client, our method utilizes the latest uploaded model from the target client to retrain and adjust the attack model, effectively countering the influence of these defense mechanisms.</p>

Researchers have begun exploring the application of federated learning to train Human Activity Recognition (HAR) models, aiming to address issues such as data silos. Tu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.10979v2#bib.bib27" title="">27</a>]</cite> introduced a method named FedDL, which learns the similarity between user model weights and dynamically shares these weights to expedite convergence while maintaining high accuracy. In real-life scenarios, individuals often perform the same activities in different ways. Thus, Li et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.10979v2#bib.bib28" title="">28</a>]</cite> introduced meta-learning into federated learning with Meta-HAR, effectively enhancing the model’s personalized performance. Shen et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.10979v2#bib.bib29" title="">29</a>]</cite> proposed FedMAT, a federated multi-task attention framework, to address the heterogeneity of HAR user data by extracting features from shared and individual-specific data. Concurrently, Ouyang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.10979v2#bib.bib30" title="">30</a>]</cite> argued that previous work overlooked the intrinsic relationships between different user data, resulting in poor performance of federated learning in HAR applications. They proposed ClusterFL, which employs clustering learning based on user similarity and introduces two novel mechanisms to enhance accuracy and reduce communication overhead. Yu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.10979v2#bib.bib31" title="">31</a>]</cite> identified four challenges facing HAR in real-world applications: privacy protection, label scarcity, real-time requirements, and heterogeneous patterns. They introduced FedHAR, a semi-supervised personalized federated learning framework, to address these challenges. Li et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.10979v2#bib.bib32" title="">32</a>]</cite> emphasized the need to consider multiple aspects such as accuracy, fairness, robustness, and scalability in practical HAR scenarios. Thus, they proposed FedCHAR, a personalized federated learning framework with robustness and fairness, and further proposed the scalable and adaptive FedCHAR-DC.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.p2.1"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S5.p2.1.1">Membership Inference Attacks: </span>
Membership Inference Attack (MIA) is a method used to infer whether individuals have participated in the training of a model by determining if their data is included in the model’s training dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.10979v2#bib.bib33" title="">33</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.10979v2#bib.bib34" title="">34</a>]</cite>. Once attackers ascertain that certain data was involved in model training, they can deduce the privacy information of the data based on factors such as the model’s usage.
Typically, MIA attacks operate in a centralized machine learning setting where attackers have no knowledge of the target model’s structure or the distribution of its training data. In such scenarios, attackers can only gain limited information through black-box access to the target model, including the distribution of training data and black-box queries to the target model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.10979v2#bib.bib5" title="">5</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.10979v2#bib.bib35" title="">35</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.10979v2#bib.bib36" title="">36</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.10979v2#bib.bib37" title="">37</a>]</cite>. For example, in Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) environments, attackers could access predicted outputs of input records to the target model.
Membership inference attacks can also be extended to federated learning, aiming to infer whether a given datum belongs to the model’s training data  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.10979v2#bib.bib38" title="">38</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.10979v2#bib.bib39" title="">39</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.10979v2#bib.bib40" title="">40</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.10979v2#bib.bib6" title="">6</a>]</cite> or to identify which specific client the data belongs to  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.10979v2#bib.bib41" title="">41</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.10979v2#bib.bib42" title="">42</a>]</cite>.
Recently, membership inference attacks have been applied to the emerging field of model forgetting to assess whether private data has been thoroughly forgotten by new models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.10979v2#bib.bib43" title="">43</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.10979v2#bib.bib44" title="">44</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S6.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S6.p1.1">This study focuses on addressing data leakage issues in the process of user behavior recognition using wearable devices. We observe significant variations in HAR data among different users, leading to substantial disparities in the distribution of prediction vectors within federated models, thus posing privacy risks. To mitigate this, we propose a curious server-based membership inference attack method to investigate the privacy risks inherent in HAR model training within federated learning settings. Through experiments conducted on five publicly available HAR datasets, our results indicate that the accuracy of malicious server-based membership inference reaches 92%. Our research preliminarily confirms the significant privacy leakage risks associated with federated training across multiple wearable devices, offering a valuable perspective for the HAR domain.</p>
