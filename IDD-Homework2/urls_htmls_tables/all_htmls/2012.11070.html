<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a popular collaborative distributed machine learning paradigm across mobile devices. However, practical FL over resource constrained mobile devices confronts multiple challenges, e.g., the local on-device training and model updates in FL are power hungry and radio resource intensive for mobile devices. To address these challenges, in this paper, we attempt to take FL into the design of future wireless networks and develop a novel joint design of wireless transmission and weight quantization for energy efficient FL over mobile devices. Specifically, we develop flexible weight quantization schemes to facilitate on-device local training over heterogeneous mobile devices. Based on the observation that the energy consumption of local computing is comparable to that of model updates, we formulate the energy efficient FL problem into a mixed-integer programming problem where the quantization and spectrum resource allocation strategies are jointly determined for heterogeneous mobile devices to minimize the overall FL energy consumption (computation + transmissions) while guaranteeing model performance and training latency. Since the optimization variables of the problem are strongly coupled, an efficient iterative algorithm is proposed, where the bandwidth allocation and weight quantization levels are derived. Extensive simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the incredible surge of mobile data and the growing computing capabilities of mobile devices, it becomes a trend to apply deep learning (DL) on these devices to support fast responsive and customized intelligent applications. Recently, federated learning (FL) has been regarded as a promising DL solution to providing an efficient, flexible, and privacy-preserving learning framework over a large number of mobile devices. Under the FL framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, each mobile device executes model training locally and then transmits the model updates, instead of raw data, to an FL server. The server will then aggregate the intermediate results and broadcast the updated model to the participating devices. Its potential has prompted wide applications in various domains such as keyboard predictions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, physical hazards detection in smart home <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, health event detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, etc.
Unfortunately, it also faces many significant challenges when deploying FL over mobile devices in practice. First, although mobile devices are gradually equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) computing capabilities, the limited resources (e.g., battery power, computing and storage capacity) restrain them from training deep and complicated learning models at scale. Second, it is unclear how to establish an effective wireless network architecture to support FL over mobile devices. Finally, the power-hungry local computing and wireless communications during iterations in FL may be too much for the power-constrained mobile devices to afford.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The mismatch between the computing and storage requirements of DL models and the limited resources of mobile devices becomes even more challenging due to the increasing complexity of the state-of-art DL models. To address this issue, one of the most popular solutions is to compress a trained network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Han et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> successfully applied multiple compression methods, e.g., pruning and quantization, to several large-scale neural networks (e.g., AlexNet and VGG-16). These compression techniques help reduce model complexity by multiple orders of magnitude and speed up model inference on mobile devices. However, on-device training is less explored and more complicated than its inference counterpart. Some pioneering works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> have made efforts on quantizing the model parameters to make it possible to conduct computationally efficient on-device training. Nevertheless, most existing compressed on-device learning frameworks and the associated convergence analysis for the potential on-device training only consider the case of a single mobile device. A few works, such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, have considered quantized on-device training in distributed learning settings. However, they assign the same quantization strategy for different mobile devices. In practice, FL may encompass massively distributed mobile devices that are highly heterogeneous in computing capability and communication conditions. Thus, it is in dire need to develop a flexible quantization scheme catering to the heterogeneous devices and investigate the impacts of such heterogeneity on learning performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Besides the on-device training for local computing, the energy consumption for FL over mobile devices also includes the wireless communications for the intermediate model update exchanges. Particularly, with the advance of computing hardware and future wireless communication techniques, like 5G and beyond (5G+) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, we have observed that the energy consumption for local computing in FL is comparable to that for the wireless transmissions on mobile devices. For instance, the energy consumption of local computing (e.g., 42.75J for one Tesla P100 GPU of one training iteration for Alexnet with batch size of 128) is comparable to that of today's wireless communications (e.g., 38.4J for transmitting 240MB Alexnet model parameters at 100 Mbps data rate <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>). Thus, a viable design of the energy efficient FL over mobile devices has to consider the energy consumption of both ``working" (i.e., local computing) and ``talking" (i.e., wireless communications). However, most existing works in wireless communities have mainly conducted the radio resource allocation under the FL convergence constraints <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, while neglecting the energy consumption in learning. Moreover, among the previous works, the targeted learning models are either relatively simple (i.e., with convex loss functions) or shallow networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, which is inconsistent with the current trend of the overparameterized DL models. On the other hand, most efforts in the machine learning communities have focused on communication efficient FL algorithmic designs, such as compressing the size of the model updates or reducing the update frequency during the training phase. The basic assumption is that the wireless transmission data rate is slow, which results in the bottleneck to support complicated learning models over mobile devices. Therefore, the goal of such designs is to reduce the number of communications in model updates without considering the advance of wireless transmissions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Fortunately, the future wireless transmissions (e.g., 5G/6G cellular, WiFi-6 or future version of WiFi), featured by very high data rate (1 Gbps or more <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>) with ultra low latency of 1 ms or less for massive number of devices,
can be leveraged to relieve the communication bottleneck with proper design. Furthermore, the multi-access edge computing in the future networks enhances the computing capabilities at the edge networks, and hence provides an ideal architecture to support viable FL.</p>

<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Motivated by the aforementioned challenges (i.e., inefficient on-device training and large overall energy consumption in FL training), in this paper, we develop a wireless transmission and on-device weight quantization co-design for energy efficient FL over heterogeneous mobile devices. We aim to 1) facilitate efficient on-device training on heterogeneous local devices via a flexible quantization scheme, and 2) minimize the overall energy consumption during the FL learning process by considering the learning performance and training latency. Based on the derived convergence analysis, we formulate the energy minimization problem to determine the optimal quantization strategy and bandwidth allocations.

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recognizing that training large-scale FL models over mobile devices can be both time and energy consuming tasks, several research efforts have been made on decreasing these costs via device scheduling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, network optimization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> and resource utilization optimization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. In particular, the resource allocation for optimizing overall FL energy efficiency was studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. Mo et al. in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> have designed the computing and communication resources allocation to minimize the energy consumption while only considering the CPU models for mobile devices. Zeng et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> proposed to partition the computing workload between CPU-GPU to improve the computing energy efficiency. However, their resource allocation strategies are for particular (non-optimal) model parameters (i.e., weight quantization levels in this paper). Thus, they overlook the opportunities to first reduce the costs in learning (i.e., model quantization in this paper) before utilizing the available resources. Close to our work, Li et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> considered to sparsify the model size before transmission to improve communication efficiency and determine heterogeneity-aware gradient sparsification strategies. However, they neglect the mismatch between the computing/storage requirement for on-device training and the limited computing resources on mobile devices. Based on the example illustrated in Section <a href="#S1" title="1 Introduction ‣ Energy Efficient Federated Learning over Heterogeneous Mobile Devices via Joint Design of Weight Quantization and Wireless Transmission" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, on-device computing consumes more energy than model update transmission. Hence, different from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, this paper leverages the quantization method for on-device training instead of wireless transmission only.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Various works have been developed for on-device learning to reduce the model complexities via low precision operation and storage requirements <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. In the extreme case, the weights and activations are represented in one bit, called Binary Neural Networks (BNN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, while the performance degrades significantly in large DNNs. For weight quantization, the prior work such as “LQ-Net” in Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> quantized weights and activations such that the inner products can be computed efficiently with bit-wise operations, performing in the case of single machine computation. Similar to our work, Fu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> considered the weight quantization for local devices in the distributed learning setting and proposed to quantize activations via estimating Weibull distributions. However, they did not consider optimization for energy efficiency in FL training. Besides, they assigned the same quantization level across different participating devices, which limited the performance when facing the challenges of device heterogeneity. It left the impact of flexible quantization schemes on the learning model accuracy as an open problem, which will be addressed in this work. Unlike these existing works, a mobile-compatible FL algorithm with flexible weight quantization is introduced in our proposed model. By jointly considering the heterogeneous computing and communication conditions, we formulate the overall FL energy (computing + transmissions) minimization problem to seek for the optimal weight quantization levels and bandwidth allocation across multiple mobile devices.</p>

Quantization is an attractive solution to implementing FL models on mobile devices efficiently. It represents model parameters, including the weights, feature maps, and even gradients, with low-precision arithmetic (e.g., 8-bit fixed-point numbers). When the model parameters are stored and computed with low-bitwidth, the computational units and memory storage to perform the operations during on-device training are much smaller than the full-precision counterparts, resulting in energy reduction during on-device training.</p>

Smaller resolution leads to a smaller gap and keeps as much information as the original weight, while it has higher memory requirements. In practice, the bit-width for the weight quantization can be extremely small, like 2 or 3 bits without notable performance degradation. Other parameters, such as the weight gradient calculations and updates, are applied to capture accumulated small changes in stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In contrast, quantization makes them insensitive to such information and may impede convergence performance during training. Therefore, we keep a higher precision for the gradients than the weights and inputs so that the edge server aggregates the local gradients and updates the global model in full precision.</p>

Unlike the prior works that maintain the same quantization strategy across all the participating devices, FWQ considers device heterogeneity and allows the mobile devices to perform weight quantization with different bit-widths of <math id="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="q_{i}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1a"><msub id="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">q</mi><mi id="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">i</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.2">𝑞</ci><ci id="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑖</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1c">q_{i}</annotation></semantics></math> during on-device training and transmit the model updates in more bits.

Besides, these strategies also greatly impact the energy consumption of mobile devices since they affect the total communication rounds and computing workload per round. In this section, we formulate the energy efficient FWQ problem (EE-FWQ) under model convergence and training delay guarantee. We develop flexible weight quantization and bandwidth allocation to balance the trade-off between computing and communication energy of mobile devices in FL training. We start with discussion on the computing and communication energy model, followed by problem formulation and solution.</p>

First, CPUs cannot support relatively large and complicated model training tasks. Second, GPUs are more energy efficient than CPUs for on-device training and are increasingly integrated into today's mobile devices (e.g., Google Pixel). The GPU based training makes computing energy consumption comparable to that of communications in FL.

That is consistent with our convergence analysis that the discretization error induced by the quantization is unavoidable. This error is accumulated by all the participating mobile devices, which indicates some mobile devices take aggressive quantization levels (e.g., 8 bit) due to their resource limitation. As for our proposed FWQ scheme, since it considers this error in the quantization selection, the degradation is well controlled and relatively small. The corresponding energy consumption in the FL training is presented in Fig. <a href="#S4.F2.sf2" title="In Figure 2 ‣ 4.3.2 Joint weight quantization selection and bandwidth allocation ‣ 4.3 Iterative algorithm for EE-FWQ ‣ 4 Optimization for Energy Efficient FWQ ‣ Energy Efficient Federated Learning over Heterogeneous Mobile Devices via Joint Design of Weight Quantization and Wireless Transmission" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2(b)</span></a> and Fig. <a href="#S4.F2.sf4" title="In Figure 2 ‣ 4.3.2 Joint weight quantization selection and bandwidth allocation ‣ 4.3 Iterative algorithm for EE-FWQ ‣ 4 Optimization for Energy Efficient FWQ ‣ Energy Efficient Federated Learning over Heterogeneous Mobile Devices via Joint Design of Weight Quantization and Wireless Transmission" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2(d)</span></a>. It demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed scheme. The FWQ scheme is superior to the other three schemes in terms of the trade-off between the overall energy efficiency for FL training and training accuracy. It consumes x2 - x100 less energy than the other three schemes in the FL training process with only a 1.1% accuracy loss.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We now evaluate how the number of users affects the total energy consumption for FL training. Fig. <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 4.3.2 Joint weight quantization selection and bandwidth allocation ‣ 4.3 Iterative algorithm for EE-FWQ ‣ 4 Optimization for Energy Efficient FWQ ‣ Energy Efficient Federated Learning over Heterogeneous Mobile Devices via Joint Design of Weight Quantization and Wireless Transmission" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> shows that the average energy consumption decreases as the number of mobile devices participating in FL increases. The average energy consumption per device does not experience too much change even after more devices participate in FL training under all the schemes. The reason is that bringing more devices to train the FL model helps speed up the model convergence and thus reduce energy consumption, which is consistent with the sub-linear speedup in Theorem <a href="#Thmtheorem1" title="Theorem 1. ‣ 3.3 Convergence Analysis of FL with FWQ ‣ 3 FL with Flexible Weight Quantization ‣ Energy Efficient Federated Learning over Heterogeneous Mobile Devices via Joint Design of Weight Quantization and Wireless Transmission" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.

Besides, our proposed FWQ scheme outperforms “FL FDMA” and “FlexibleSpar”. For example, the proposed FWQ scheme saves the energy of “FL FDMA” by 56% and of “FlexibleSpar” by 35%, respectively. The reason is that the proposed FWQ leverages weight quantization to reduce the workload for on-device training and optimize the weight quantization levels for heterogeneous devices, while the computing workload is not optimized and fixed for all the devices in both “FL FDMA” and “FlexibleSpar” scheme. Moreover, the proposed FWQ scheme reduces the energy in the “Unified Q” strategy by 20% and the “Rand Q” strategy by 38.7%, respectively, when the number of users is equal to 10. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed weight quantization scheme.</p>

From Fig. <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 4.3.2 Joint weight quantization selection and bandwidth allocation ‣ 4.3 Iterative algorithm for EE-FWQ ‣ 4 Optimization for Energy Efficient FWQ ‣ Energy Efficient Federated Learning over Heterogeneous Mobile Devices via Joint Design of Weight Quantization and Wireless Transmission" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, we observe that, as the overall bandwidth becomes small, the ratio of the communication energy consumption to the overall energy consumption grows, which means wireless communications have a larger impact on the total energy consumption than local computing. As a result, the mobile devices in group 1, with small channel gain, become the stragglers in FL training and could slow down the gradient update time for one iteration.
To avoid the update delay for the next iteration and reduce the overall energy consumption, they have to take aggressive actions to compress their local models into the smallest number of bits. However this results in large discretization noise and degrades the performance, as stated in Theorem <a href="#Thmtheorem1" title="Theorem 1. ‣ 3.3 Convergence Analysis of FL with FWQ ‣ 3 FL with Flexible Weight Quantization ‣ Energy Efficient Federated Learning over Heterogeneous Mobile Devices via Joint Design of Weight Quantization and Wireless Transmission" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. To compensate for that, those who have better channel gain need to ``work" more by using a higher precision model to perform local training. Similarly, when the available bandwidth increases, the computing contributes more to the overall energy consumption. Those mobile devices with smaller local computing capacities choose to compress their models more to save computing energy.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have studied the energy efficiency of FL training via joint design of wireless transmission and weight quantization. We have jointly exploited the flexible weight quantization selection and the bandwidth allocation to develop an energy efficient FL training algorithm over heterogeneous mobile devices, constrained by the training delay and learning performance. The weight quantization approach has been leveraged to deal with the mismatch between high model computing complexity and limited computing capacities of mobile devices. The convergence rate of FL with local quantization has been analyzed. Guided by the derived theoretical convergence bound, we have formulated the energy efficient FL training problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming. Since the optimization variables of the problem are strongly coupled, we have proposed an efficient iterative algorithm, where the closed-form solution of the bandwidth allocation and weight quantization levels are derived in each iteration. By comparing with different quantization levels through extensive simulations, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed scheme in handling device heterogeneity and reducing overall energy consumption in FL over heterogeneous mobile devices.</p>
