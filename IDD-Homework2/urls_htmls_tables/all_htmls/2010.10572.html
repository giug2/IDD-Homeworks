<p id="id1.1" class="ltx_p">In federated learning, machine learning and deep learning models are trained globally on distributed devices. The state-of-the-art privacy-preserving technique in the context of federated learning is user-level differential privacy. However, such a mechanism is vulnerable to some specific model poisoning attacks such as Sybil attacks. A malicious adversary could create multiple fake clients or collude compromised devices in Sybil attacks to mount direct model updates manipulation. Recent works on novel defense against model poisoning attacks are difficult to detect Sybil attacks when differential privacy is utilized, as it masks clients’ model updates with perturbation. In this work, we implement the first Sybil attacks on differential privacy based federated learning architectures and show their impacts on model convergence. We randomly compromise some clients by manipulating different noise levels reflected by the local privacy budget <math id="id1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\epsilon" display="inline"><semantics id="id1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="id1.1.m1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">ϵ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1">italic-ϵ</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id1.1.m1.1c">\epsilon</annotation></semantics></math> of differential privacy on the local model updates of these Sybil clients such that the global model convergence rates decrease or even leads to divergence. We apply our attacks to two recent aggregation defense mechanisms, called Krum and Trimmed Mean. Our evaluation results on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets show that our attacks effectively slow down the convergence of the global models. We then propose a method to keep monitoring the average loss of all participants in each round for convergence anomaly detection and defend our Sybil attacks based on the prediction cost reported from each client. Our empirical study demonstrates that our defense approach effectively mitigates the impact of our Sybil attacks on model convergence.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Machine learning and deep learning techniques have become prevailing in artificial intelligence. Along with this rise of application in clinical imaging for pathologic diagnosis and intelligent agriculture for crop monitoring, data privacy and security are the major concerns during machine learning training and test procedure. Learning from unbalanced and non-IID (not independently and identically distributed) data while preserving privacy, federated learning methods are proposed to train global models on distributed devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. In federated learning, each device or organization as a client has private data of training that is inaccessible to other clients and the server, which protects data privacy and data security.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In federated learning, learning models are shared globally.
However, such a distribution scale introduces practical challenges to reliability against various attacks towards the system. For example, this framework is vulnerable to model poisoning attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, and it becomes even worse to some specific model poisoning attacks, called the Sybil attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. In one study, Fung et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> demonstrate that a deep learning network model in federated learning can be easily subverted by using the Sybil attack. In such attacks, the clients’ model updates are tampered with a backdoor into the learned model, even if a small fraction of clients are compromised <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">As a defense technique in cryptography, differential privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> is utilized in federated learning to protect data confidentiality between the communications among server and multiple clients. By adding a certain distribution of random noise on each client’s update locally or on the aggregated global model, user-level differential privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> can be achieved when training a global model. In this setting, any specific user’s data will not influence the behaviours of a trained model no matter it is used for training or not during the learning process. However, there have some weaknesses in these methods. One of which is that differential privacy requires that the scale of additive noises has to match the scale of parameters in the model updates to preserve utility. Therefore, it needs a comparatively larger number of clients or a larger value of privacy budget compared to that in the central setting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Inspired by this limitation of user-level differential privacy which leaves more space for the attack, we introduce our Sybil attacks that aim to manipulate the updated parameters inside local models such that the aggregated model in the server has a high cost of the prediction indiscriminately for training examples, which makes the global model converges slowly, or even leads to divergence.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">We perform the study on differential privacy based Sybil attacks in federated learning settings. A key challenge for the attacker is that how the compromised model updates from Sybil clients can obscure the aggregation defense rules in the uncompromised server to deviate the global model from its original prediction. To address the challenge, we apply different strategies to carefully craft local model updates of Sybil clients according to different aggregation rules by manipulating different noise levels reflected by the local privacy budget <math id="S1.p4.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\epsilon" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p4.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S1.p4.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml">ϵ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p4.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S1.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p4.1.m1.1.1">italic-ϵ</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p4.1.m1.1c">\epsilon</annotation></semantics></math> of differential privacy. Our goal of the attack is to introduce higher training costs in the global model when the server aggregates all the clients’ updates, including our crafted parameters in each training round compared with the original one. Our attack intuition is the accumulated high cost during the learning process may slow down the convergence of the global model significantly.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Existing defenses against model poisoning attacks replace the mean aggregation rule in the central server with a Byzantine-resilient algorithm as the robust aggregator <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. However, these defenses do not take into account the scenarios where differential privacy is applied in the federated learning model. Whereas differential privacy prevents data leakage, federated learning models are still susceptible to model poisoning attacks, especially to Sybil attacks. To address this challenge, we propose our defense method to defend against our Sybil attacks on differential privacy based federated learning settings. Our proposed defense excludes those client updates inducing high loss values of prediction on the global model where the cost is evaluated based on the loss report from each client. Empirical results show that our proposed defense mechanism effectively mitigates the impacts of our Sybil attacks on the convergence of the global model.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The most distinction between federated learning and centralized machine learning is that federated learning trains a model collaboratively across distributed client devices. Thus, it opens up new attack surfaces such that the adversary can manipulate the model updates sent back to the server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. This class of adversarial attacks is known as model poisoning attacks. Since the corrupted model updates can be arbitrary, model poisoning attacks are generally viewed as the most powerful and worst-case attacks, which is also referred to as Byzantine attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Currently, Byzantine attacks mainly aim to degrade model performance or even make the global model unusable. Based on the goal of the adversary, these Byzantine attacks can be further classified as <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">untargeted attacks</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. However, the limitation is that the attacker has to know about the aggregation rule in the server entirely. Otherwise, the attacks would be much less effective. Another category of model poisoning attack is <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">targeted attacks</span>. The aim is that the trained model is modified in desired behaviour for the adversary, such as misclassification on some specific tasks. Bhagoji et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> revealed that the learned global model could be poisoned to the misclassify targeted objective while preserving the classification accuracy of the trained model. Moreover, it needs only a small portion of client devices to be compromised for their targeted model poisoning attacks. However, it assumes that the server uses the accuracy of validation data to detect anomalous updates. In the training process, validation data are not accurate enough compared to training data due to the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm. Therefore, the effect of this kind of attack is limited without the appropriate assumptions. In the literature, data poisoning attacks are explored comprehensively. In data poisoning attacks, the adversary tampers the training dataset of clients by replacing labels or adding perturbations to the original data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.
Targeted attacks are also referred to as backdoor attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, in which the performance of the global model on specific tasks is influenced by manipulating client data. In the work of targeted attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> for model poisoning attacks, the final weights update sent back by the malicious client is learned from the auxiliary data. Therefore, we can see that although the model poisoning attacks are more powerful, it is enormously important to investigate data poisoning attacks for well understanding of the relation between them. Although some past work has explored untargeted data poisoning that reduces the accuracy of the global model notably using crafted training data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, research directions on targeted data poisoning attacks are dominant.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A common method to aggregate the local models is using the mean aggregation rule <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. However, this model averaging is susceptible to adversarial attacks and hardly provides privacy guarantees. Many works have explored Byzantine-resilient defense mechanisms for federated learning. Specifically, recent works propose various robust aggregation rules against both untargeted and targeted attacks. As the popular aggregation defense mechanisms, Krum <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> and Trimmed Mean <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> are proposed to be robust under untargeted adversarial settings. These methods replace the mean aggregation rule in the central server with a Byzantine-resilient algorithm as the robust aggregator. However, these mechanisms work under appropriate assumptions that provably asymptotic on the number of the client. With data poisoning attacks, they can be viewed as special cases of model poisoning attacks. The reason is that compromised training data will induce anomaly in clients’ model updates. Therefore, Byzantine-resilient defenses against model poisoning attacks may also work for data poisoning attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. It is noteworthy that any proposed robust defense has to guarantee the convergence of the global model when using a gradient descent algorithm on the client.</p>

In this method, the noises added to the model updates of Sybil clients are from either the positive or negative part of Laplace distribution in phase.

The binary search algorithm is used to locate Sybil model updates among all the participating clients. The invariant in binary search is the key insight of our proposed defense method, which is that the average loss of clients containing Sybil attackers is larger than that of the other half. Specifically, we split the model updates from all the clients and average the local model parameters of each half, <math id="S5.p5.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="w_{t}^{\prime}" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p5.2.m2.1a"><msubsup id="S5.p5.2.m2.1.1" xref="S5.p5.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.p5.2.m2.1.1.2.2" xref="S5.p5.2.m2.1.1.2.2.cmml">w</mi><mi id="S5.p5.2.m2.1.1.2.3" xref="S5.p5.2.m2.1.1.2.3.cmml">t</mi><mo id="S5.p5.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S5.p5.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">′</mo></msubsup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p5.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S5.p5.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p5.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.p5.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p5.2.m2.1.1">superscript</csymbol><apply id="S5.p5.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.p5.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.p5.2.m2.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S5.p5.2.m2.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.p5.2.m2.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S5.p5.2.m2.1.1.2.2">𝑤</ci><ci id="S5.p5.2.m2.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S5.p5.2.m2.1.1.2.3">𝑡</ci></apply><ci id="S5.p5.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.p5.2.m2.1.1.3">′</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p5.2.m2.1c">w_{t}^{\prime}</annotation></semantics></math> and <math id="S5.p5.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="w_{t}^{\prime\prime}" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p5.3.m3.1a"><msubsup id="S5.p5.3.m3.1.1" xref="S5.p5.3.m3.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.p5.3.m3.1.1.2.2" xref="S5.p5.3.m3.1.1.2.2.cmml">w</mi><mi id="S5.p5.3.m3.1.1.2.3" xref="S5.p5.3.m3.1.1.2.3.cmml">t</mi><mo id="S5.p5.3.m3.1.1.3" xref="S5.p5.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml">′′</mo></msubsup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p5.3.m3.1b"><apply id="S5.p5.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p5.3.m3.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.p5.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p5.3.m3.1.1">superscript</csymbol><apply id="S5.p5.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.p5.3.m3.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.p5.3.m3.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S5.p5.3.m3.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.p5.3.m3.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S5.p5.3.m3.1.1.2.2">𝑤</ci><ci id="S5.p5.3.m3.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S5.p5.3.m3.1.1.2.3">𝑡</ci></apply><ci id="S5.p5.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.p5.3.m3.1.1.3">′′</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p5.3.m3.1c">w_{t}^{\prime\prime}</annotation></semantics></math> respectively.

For example, when defending our proposed attack on the CNN model, the error rate remains at 3%, which is the same as it when there is no attack. However, Krum and Trimmed Mean are not effective to defend our proposed attack. The error rates increase to 14% and 85% respectively. According to (<a href="#S6.E7" title="In VI-A Empirical Setting ‣ VI Evaluation ‣ Mitigating Sybil Attacks on Differential Privacy based Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>), a small error rate reflects high testing accuracy, which means that the training loss achieves a local minimum after 50 rounds of training.

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper comprehensively analyzes diverse attacks and defenses on federated learning. The application of differential privacy in the context of federated learning is user-level differentially private. In this paper, we evaluate the vulnerabilities of differential privacy based federated learning and explore possible defense mechanism.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our work raises the interests in the research direction of differential privacy based federated learning. We also explore the attacks and defense mechanisms with untargeted model poisoning attacks. In future research, targeted model poisoning attacks that are strongly related to data poisoning attacks will be investigated in real-world application scenarios such as pathologic diagnosis and intelligent agriculture.</p>
