<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">With the development of federated learning (FL), mobile devices (MDs) are able to train their local models with private data and sends them to a central server for aggregation, thereby preventing sensitive raw data leakage. In this paper, we aim to improve the training performance of FL systems in the context of wireless channels and stochastic energy arrivals of MDs.
To this purpose, we dynamically optimize MDs' transmission power and training task scheduling. We first model this dynamic programming problem as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP).
Due to high dimensions rooted from our CMDP problem, we propose online stochastic learning methods to simplify the CMDP and design online algorithms to obtain an efficient policy for all MDs. Since there are long-term constraints in our CMDP, we utilize Lagrange multipliers approach to tackle this issue. Furthermore, we prove the convergence of the proposed online stochastic learning algorithm. Numerical results indicate that the proposed algorithms can achieve better performance than the benchmark algorithms.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the last decade, we have witnessed a series of amazing breakthroughs, such as AlphaGo, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), which have become the most cutting-edge technology in both academia and industry communities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
Distributed machine learning based on mobile edge computing (MEC) of the wireless networks is also one of the current hot research directions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. The sample data for machine learning can be obtained by collecting massive amounts of data from mobile devices (MD) distributed in the wireless network.
By training these data, the training performance of machine learning can be greatly improved.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Although offloading the local sample data of distributed MDs for centralized learning significantly improves the performance of machine learning, this mechanism suffers from two flaws. First, transmission delays from distributed MDs to the central cloudy via backbone network are extremely large. Second, the local data often contains the private information of MDs, and uploading the private information to the central cloudy will lead to the risk of personal privacy leakage. To cope with these two issues, federated learning (FL) has been introduced to act as an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm, which is indeed a way to combine MEC with traditional machine learning. In this manner, MDs train their local data and send their local model updates to a task publisher iteratively instead of uploading the raw data to a central server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, which, in general, brings the following two benefits. (I) The communication latency and the energy consumption for computation can be significantly reduced owing to the fact that MDs are not required to upload huge amounts of local data for training to an edge server. (II) MDs upload their local model instead of the raw data to the edge server, which greatly reduces the risk of personal privacy information leakage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the aforementioned advantages of FL, there are still many challenges that have not been solved until now. Some existing studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> adopted an idealized assumption that all MDs participating in FL are immune to the wireless and computation resource constraints. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> only focused on a practical Federated-Averaging algorithm for distributed DNN training and the training performance. Many studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> have been committed to further reducing the communication overhead by developing compression methods.
However in practice, MDs usually suffer from energy consumption constraints that may reduce the network lifetime and training efficiency.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In addition, frequent wireless communications is usually required for uploading and downloading the model parameters, which would increase the bandwidth cost and the training latency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Therefore, it is necessary to design a feasible resource scheduling scheme to optimize the resource scheduling problem in the FL process. Without taking into account the energy constraints and battery dynamics
of MDs, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> formulated a FL over a wireless networks as a static optimization problem, and exploited the problem structure to decompose it into three static convex sub-problems. The work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> proposed a static scheduling scheme to efficiently execute distributed learning tasks in an asynchronous manner while minimizing the gradient staleness on wireless edge nodes with heterogeneous computing and communication capacities. However, many properties of MEC networks are usually time-varying in the FL process and thus the methods in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> will result in considerable performance loss. The work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> model the channel and energy dynamically, and exploit the dynamic scheduling algorithm to obtain the asymptotically optimal resluts. Thus, it is of vital importance to develop efficient dynamic resource scheduling schemes to improve the performance of FL.</p>

<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we utilize constrained Markov decision processes (CMDP) as a mathematical tool to obtain an optimal algorithm for dynamic resource scheduling for FL, where each MD send local model updates

In particular, each MD possesses computing units with computing capability, which can be used for local machine learning with local raw data.

Since the quantitative analysis of the accuracy in the test set is relatively difficult, we use the size of local dataset accumulated from MDs over iterations to evaluate the accuracy of the machine learning model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</span></span></span>, we propose an efficient stochastic optimization algorithm for scheduling resources of MDs in the FL processes by obtaining an efficient setting of the size of raw data for local training, and the transmission power of MDs to upload the local model.</p>

<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Although the idea of applying CMDP to design dynamic resource scheduling is not new, we are motivated to address the resource scheduling issues of resource constraints and dynamics of FL. To achieve high-quality learning performance,
a reasonable constrained dynamic scene is essential to the resource scheduling issues <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. Previous work has utilized CMDP as a mathematical model to design effective algorithms for resource scheduling in wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, which is considered as an effective tool for solving dynamic problems and time-related state problems. Inspired by this, we apply CMDP as the mathematical scene to address the resource scheduling problem in the FL process. Nevertheless, previous work still has some shortcomings in solving CMDP problems. The literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> adopted a deep learning algorithm that allows the edge server to learn and find optimal decisions without any a priori knowledge of network dynamics in the CMDP. However, reinforcement learning is poorly scalable and requires a lot of computing power and duration for training. The literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> obtained the optimal solution for the formulated CMDP offloading problem by linear programming and Q-learning method. Neither method is suitable for large-scale networks, which will lead to the curse of dimension. The work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> developed a threshold-based algorithm to obtain the optimal delay-power tradeoff efficiently, in which the authors used the special structure of the mathematical model to solve the CMDP problem, and this method does not possess the universality of solving the problem.</p>

In the FL system, sequential decisions on local training and parameter transmission needs to be made for each iteration.

Due to the extremely small size of data for state information and action decisions, we can ignore the transmission delay and transmission energy for upload of local states and transmission of the policy in the FL network.

Since we consider the stochastic channels, where the
channel gain varies within the interval, it is easy to see that each state will be updated comparably often in the asynchronous learning algorithm. Quoting the conclusion in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, the convergence property of the asynchronous update and synchronous
update is the same. Therefore, we just consider the convergence of related synchronous version for simplicity in this proof.

<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We compare our proposed approximate MDP solution with online stochastic learning with three other reference control algorithms. One is the CSI-based MDP algorithm, where
the edge server takes corresponding decisions based on the channel state only at the current iteration so as to optimize average utility of
all MDs. The second reference control algorithm is myopic method, which is a method that only considers the current utility. In myopic method,
the edge server never considers long-term utilities. The last reference control algorithm is a random
resource scheduling method, where the edge server takes random actions in the feasible regions. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by
averaging over 5000 experiments.</p>

the performance of online learning is close to that of other reference algorithms, especially the CSI-based MDP algorithm. The cause of this phenomenon is twofold.
First, the small mean arrival rate <math id="S5.p3.6.m6.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\lambda" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p3.6.m6.1a"><mi id="S5.p3.6.m6.1.1" xref="S5.p3.6.m6.1.1.cmml">λ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p3.6.m6.1b"><ci id="S5.p3.6.m6.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p3.6.m6.1.1">𝜆</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p3.6.m6.1c">\lambda</annotation></semantics></math> of energy will result in a limited energy level in the battery of the MD. Due to insufficient battery energy,
MDs are constrained with a small space of actions compared with those with sufficient battery power. The second reason is that a large amount of battery energy is used
for uploading local parameters. When the battery energy of MD is insufficient, the energy for local training of FL is smaller,
which leads to smaller long-term average utility. In contrast, when the battery level is high, MD's actions will
become more diverse, and more energy will be used for local training in FL process.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we study a constrained MDP problem of FL with a MEC sever, where each MDs send local model updates trained on their local sensitive data iteratively to
the edge server, and the edge server aggregates the parameters from MDs and broadcasts the aggregated parameters to MDs. We first model
the resource scheduling problem in the synchronous FL process as a constrained MDP problem, and we use the size of the training samples as the performance of FL for analysis. Due to the coupling between iterations and the complexity of the state-action space, we cannot directly solve the constrained MDP problem. Thus, we analyze the problem by equivalent Bellman equations and use approximate MDP and stochastic learning methods to simplify the constrained MDP problem so as to approximate the state value function.
Then we design static algorithm to obtain the static policy for each MD based the approximate state value function. Finally, we provide theoretical analysis for the convergence of the online stochastic learning algorithm. The simulation results show that the performance of the stochastic leaning is better than various benchmark schemes.</p>
