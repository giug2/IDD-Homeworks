<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is known to be vulnerable to both security and privacy issues. Existing research has focused either on preventing poisoning attacks from users or on concealing the local model updates from the server, but not both. However, integrating these two lines of research remains a crucial challenge since they often conflict with one another with respect to the threat model.</p>
<p id="id2.id2" class="ltx_p">In this work, we develop a principle framework that offers both privacy guarantees for users and detection against poisoning attacks from them. With a new threat model that includes both an honest-but-curious server and malicious users, we first propose a secure aggregation protocol using homomorphic encryption for the server to combine local model updates in a private manner. Then, a zero-knowledge proof protocol is leveraged to shift the task of detecting attacks in the local models from the server to the users. The key observation here is that the server no longer needs access to the local models for attack detection. Therefore, our framework enables the central server to identify poisoned model updates without violating the privacy guarantees of secure aggregation.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is an engaging framework for large-scale distributed training of deep learning models with thousands to millions of users. In every round, a central server distributes the current global model to a random subset of users. Each of the users trains locally and submits a model update to the server. Then, the server averages the updates into a new global model. Federated learning has inspired many applications in many domains, especially training image classifiers and next-word predictors on users’ smartphones <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. To exploit a wide range of training data while maintaining users’ privacy, federated learning by design has no visibility into users’ local data and training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the great potential of federated learning in large-scale distributed training with thousands to millions of users, the current system is still vulnerable to certain privacy and security risks. First, although the training data of each user is not disclosed to the server, the model update is. This poses a privacy threat, as it is suggested that a trained neural network’s parameters enable a reconstruction and/or inference of the original training data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Second, federated learning is generally vulnerable to model poisoning attacks that leverage the fact that federated learning enables adversarial users to directly influence the global model, thereby allowing considerably more powerful attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Recent research on federated learning focuses on either improving the privacy of model updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> or preventing certain poisoning attacks from malicious users <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, but not both.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To preserve user privacy, secure aggregation protocols have been introduced into federated learning to devise a training framework that protects the local model updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>. These protocols enable the server to privately combine the local models in order to update the global model without learning any information about each individual local model. Specifically, the server can compute the sum of the parameters of the local models while not having access to the local models themselves. As a result, the local model updates are concealed from the server, thereby preventing the server from exploiting the updates of any user to infer their private training data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, previous studies also unveil a vulnerability of federated learning when it comes to certain adversarial attacks from malicious users, especially poisoning attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. This vulnerability leverages the fact that federated learning gives users the freedom to train their local models. Specifically, any user can train in any way that benefits the attack, such as arbitrarily modifying the weights of their local models. To prevent such attacks, a conventional approach is to have the central server run some defense mechanisms to inspect each of the model updates, such as using anomaly detection algorithms to filter out the poisoned ones <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">However, combining these two lines of research on privacy and security is not trivial since they contradict one another. In particular, by allowing the server to inspect local model updates from users to filter out the attacked ones, it violates the security model of secure aggregation. In fact, under a secure aggregation setting, the server should not be able to learn any information about individual model updates. Therefore, with secure aggregation, the server cannot run any defense mechanism directly on each model update to deduce whether it is attack-free or not. For that reason, existing FL systems with secure aggregation prevent the server from detecting poisoned local models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To tackle this issue, in this paper, we propose a framework that integrates secure aggregation with defense mechanisms against poisoning attacks from users. To circumvent the aforementioned problem, we shift the task of running the defense mechanism onto the users, and then each user is given the ability to attest the execution of the defense mechanism with respect to their model update. Simply speaking, the users are the ones who run the defense mechanism, then they have to prove to the server that the mechanism was executed correctly. To achieve this, the framework leverages a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) protocol that the users can use to prove the correctness of the execution of a defense mechanism. The ZKP protocol must also make it difficult to generate a valid proof if the defense mechanism was not run correctly, and the proof must not reveal any information about the local model update in order the retain the privacy guarantee of secure aggregation. Via our ZKP protocol, the server can verify if a defense mechanism was properly executed by the users.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">To demonstrate the feasibility of the framework, we use the backdoor attack as a use case in which we construct a ZKP protocol for a specific backdoor defense mechanism <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, we also propose a secure aggregation protocol in federated learning to address the limitations of previous work. Specifically, we show that our proposed aggregation protocol is robust against malicious users in a way that it can still maintain privacy and liveness despite the fact that some users may not follow the protocol honestly. Our framework can then combine both the ZKP and the secure aggregation protocols to tackle the above-mentioned privacy and security risks in federated learning.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Current systems proposed to address either the poisoning attacks from users or the privacy of model updates are designed using security models that conflict with each other. In fact, when preserving the privacy of model updates, the central server and the users are all considered as honest-but-curious (or semi-honest).

As shown in Fig. <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 2 System and Security model ‣ Preserving Privacy and Security in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, our framework consists of three components: (1) users aggregation, (2) zero-knowledge proof of attack-free model, and (3) computing global model. We discuss the properties of each component as follows.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we describe a secure aggregation scheme that realizes the User aggregation component of our framework. Although some secure aggregation schemes have been proposed for federated learning, they are not secure against our threat model in Section <a href="#S2" title="2 System and Security model ‣ Preserving Privacy and Security in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. Particularly, the aggregation schemes in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> assume no collusion between the server and a subset of users. The work of Bonawitz et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> fails to reconstruct the global model if one malicious user arbitrarily deviates from the secret sharing protocol.

<p id="S4.SS3.p16.1" class="ltx_p">Although both the KEM-DEM scheme and polynomial packing have the same asymptotic expansion factor (e.g., 1), each has its own advantages and disadvantages. The polynomial packing is simple and works out-of-the-box if we use the Damgard-Jurik cryptosystem. This is because Damgard-Jurik allows the plaintext size to be greater than the key size. However, it will not work with conventional cryptosystems like Paillier as they require the plaintext size to be smaller than the key size. The KEM-DEM scheme would work for all cryptosystems but it is more complex and incurs more computational overhead than the polynomial packing scheme. Since our protocol is using the Damgard-Jurik cryptosystem, Section <a href="#S6" title="6 Evaluation ‣ Preserving Privacy and Security in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> only evaluates the polynomial packing scheme.</p>

Backdoor attacks aim to make the target model to produce a specific attacker-chosen output label whenever it encounters a known trigger in the input. At the same time, the backdoored model behaves similarly to a clean model on normal inputs. In the context of federated learning, any user can replace the global model with another so that (1) the new model maintains a similar accuracy on the federated-learning task, and (2) the attacker has control over how the model behaves on a backdoor task specified by the attacker <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>

The defense mechanism works in the following manner: for each iteration, the defender executes the backdoored DNN on samples from the testing dataset, and stores the activation of each neuron per test sample. The defender then computes the neurons’ average activations over all samples. Next, the defender prunes the neuron having the lowest average activation and obtains the accuracy of the resulted DNN on the testing dataset. The defense process terminates when the accuracy drops below a predetermined threshold.</p>

Note that this process can be included during the one-time setup phase of the FL system. An implementation of this phase can be adopted from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. It is shown that with 128 users, the running time for key generation per user is less than 50 seconds, and each user consumes about 15MB of network bandwidth.

We measure the running time with key sizes of 1024, 2048, and 4096, respectively. As can be seen, under all settings, the result conforms with the running time complexity analysis.

However, the protocol relies on users honestly following the secret sharing scheme. Consequently, although the privacy guarantee for honest users still retains, a single malicious user can arbitrarily deviate from the secret sharing protocol and make the server fail to reconstruct the global model. Furthermore, there is no mechanism to identify the attacker if such an attack occurs.</p>

However, with these protocols, each party has to send a secret share of its whole data vector to a subset of the other parties. In order to make the protocols robust, the size of this subset of users should be considerably large.

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have proposed a secure framework for federated learning. Unlike existing research, we integrate both secure aggregation and defense mechanisms against poisoning attacks under the same threat model that maintains their respective security and privacy guarantees. We have also proposed a secure aggregation protocol that can maintain liveness and privacy for model updates against malicious users. Furthermore, we have designed a ZKP protocol for users to attest non-backdoored models without revealing any information about their models. Our framework combines these two protocols and shows that the server can detect backdoors while preserving the privacy of the model updates. The privacy guarantees for the users’ models have been theoretically proven. Moreover, we have presented an analysis of the computation and communication cost and provided some benchmarks regarding its runtime and bandwidth consumption</p>
