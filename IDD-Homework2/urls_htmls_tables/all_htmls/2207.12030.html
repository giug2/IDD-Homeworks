<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a promising distributed framework for collaborative artificial intelligence model training while protecting user privacy.
A bootstrapping component that has attracted significant research attention is the design of incentive mechanism to stimulate user collaboration in FL. The majority of works adopt a broker-centric approach to help the central operator to attract participants and further obtain a well-trained model.
Few works consider forging participant-centric collaboration among participants to pursue an FL model for their common interests, which induces dramatic differences in incentive mechanism design from the broker-centric FL. To coordinate the selfish and heterogeneous participants, we propose a novel analytic framework for incentivizing effective and efficient collaborations for participant-centric FL.
Specifically, we respectively propose two novel game models for contribution-oblivious FL (COFL) and contribution-aware FL (CAFL), where the latter one implements a minimum contribution threshold mechanism. We further analyze the uniqueness and existence for Nash equilibrium of both COFL and CAFL games and design efficient algorithms to achieve equilibrium solutions.
Extensive performance evaluations show that there exists free-riding phenomenon in COFL, which can be greatly alleviated through the adoption of CAFL model with the optimized minimum threshold.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile networks,
massive volumes of user data are being generated and geographically scattered over the edges of networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
To learn valuable knowledge and information from these massive data, artificial intelligence technology (AI) has been widely used to support machine learning, which dramatically expedites the emergence of many intelligent IoT mobile applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
Traditional machine learning frameworks typically require the uploading local training data to a central server for centralized learning, which suffers from the risk of privacy leaks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. To address such critical issue, federated learning (FL) has been proposed by Google as a novel paradigm to train AI model in a privacy-preserving manner <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, in which the device users learn from their local data and then upload their local model updates to the central server. Since only the local update (e.g., parameter gradients), rather than the local data, is sent to the central server by encrypted communication, the FL enables the device users to preserve data privacy efficiently.</p>

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Nevertheless, local model training incurs significant costs (e.g., computation cost or energy consumption) for the involved users in FL. Without a proper incentive mechanism, selfish participants would be reluctant to participate in FL. In terms of incentive mechanism design, the majority of existing studies focus on a broker-centric paradigm for incentivizing participation in FL (Fig. <a href="#S1.F1.sf1" title="In Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Collaboration in Participant-Centric Federated Learning: A Game-Theoretical Perspective" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1(a)</span></a>). That is, a central broker publishes a model training task and becomes a model stakeholder (model owner), who attracts participants (workers) to help complete the model training through monetary rewards via economic mechanisms such as auction and contract design
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. In these settings, the participants aim to get more payments from the broker through local model training and uploading.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Along a different line, in many application scenarios, FL training tasks are not generated by a central broker, but initiated by a group of users who themselves are also the participants in the FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, in order to collectively train a common FL model. In such participant-centric FL (Fig. <a href="#S1.F1.sf2" title="In Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Collaboration in Participant-Centric Federated Learning: A Game-Theoretical Perspective" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1(b)</span></a>), the participants are the model stakeholders and they have the common interest of obtaining a high-quality FL model via mutually-beneficial knowledge sharing. In this case, the FL server works as a coordinator to assist the FL procedure. For example, for smart home applications, users of different families can collectively boost the performance of in-home healthcare AI service via FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">However, how to design a proper incentive mechanism for participant-centric FL is much less understood in the literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Given that all participants are selfish to act for their own benefits and are also heterogeneous in various perspectives (e.g., valuation on the FL model, data sizes and computing capability), how to obtain an effective strategy for stimulating mutually-beneficial collaboration among the participants is challenging. We should emphasize that, for broker-centric FL, users’ heterogeneous cost can be well characterized and compensated with the monetary incentive by the centralized broker via classic two-sided economic mechanisms such as auctions and contracts. However, for participant-centric FL, obtaining a common FL model is the major incentive for the users, but they have usually heterogeneous cost and valuations with complex interaction structures, and their marginal benefits/contributions for each other in the FL model training are very hard to quantify. Hence designing monetary incentive mechanisms that can ensure mutually-satisfactory and trustworthy payment transferring among the users as rewards are generally prohibitive in practice, and thus monetary-free incentive mechanisms with lightweight implementation complexity are much more desired for participant-centric FL. Specifically, we need to address the following key issues for incentivizing collaboration in participant-centric FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">First of all, a monetary-free incentive-driven collaboration strategy for participant-centric FL is essential, because otherwise the participants acting for their own benefits may deviate from the collaboration strategy.
This requirement motivates a key issue: <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">How can we model the heterogeneous participants’ selfish behaviors and derive an effective collaboration strategy such that each participant has the incentive to follow without external monetary rewards?</span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Second, since the trained FL model can be shared among the participants, some participants may benefit from FL but contribute nothing, namely “free-riding”. The free-riding phenomenon leads to great unfairness in participant-centric FL. This motivates the second key issue:
<span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">How can we design an efficient mechanism to thwart the free-riding behaviors in participant-centric FL?</span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Last but not least, given that participant-centric nature of FL in our setting, how to attain a high global efficiency with a low implementation complexity would be a key challenge. This motivates the third key issue: <span id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">How can we maximize the total utility of the participants while maintaining the self-stability of FL in a lightweight manner?</span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">To address the above two key issues, we will leverage the game theoretic modeling approach for developing a comprehensive analytical framework for participant-centric FL. We take into account users’ selfish behaviors and heterogeneous characteristics, in order to derive effective collaboration strategies with the desired properties of incentive-driven collaboration, free-riding mitigation and global efficiency boosting for participant-centric FL with a simple minimum contribution threshold mechanism.

We show that the COFL game admits a unique Nash equilibrium under some regularity conditions, and also devise an algorithm to achieve it. However, our findings reveal that the free-riding phenomenon exists in COFL, which would lead to the critical issue of unfairness and greatly harm participants’ motivations for collaboration in participant-centric FL.</p>

However, we show that the existence of Nash equilibrium cannot be always guaranteed in CAFL, which may cause instable participating behaviors in FL. Thus, we propose an algorithm to refine the set of participants in CAFL, which can always guarantee to achieve a Nash equilibrium of the refined CAFL game. Furthermore, we boost the global performance by finding the optimal threshold to maximize the total utility of all participants.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We consider the participant-centric FL formed by multiple device users at the network edge.

During the local training phase, all device participants calculate local gradients based on the their data and the received model. Then the edge server (i.e., central server) aggregates all local gradients from participants (i.e., the device users) and broadcasts new gradients to each participant for next local model updates. This complete update process is called a global iteration.
All participants repeat the global iteration until the global model converges.
Since model training incurs significant time and energy cost, participants should carefully strike a balance between their valuation on the FL model (i.e., getting the model as rewards) and the training costs.
In what follows, we first characterize participants’ training costs, and then calculate participants’ utilities.</p>

the local gradients are sent to the center server through the multiple channel access technology (e.g., orthogonal frequency division medium access (OFDMA)) once the local model training accomplished.
The communication resource allocation optimization is usually determined by the central server instead of participants. Since we focus on analyzing the participants’ behaviors in participant-centric FL, we assume that the communication resource allocation for the participants’ data transmission is fixed.
We also assume that the data size of the model parameter gradients is the same for each participant in each FL iteration (which is usually the case since all the participants train the same FL model).

In general, all participants aim to obtain a well-trained model with a low loss function (or high model accuracy).
In one global iteration, higher model accuracy requires a larger global batchsize, which will further induce a higher training cost (i.e., local energy consumption and latency).
In this regard, according to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, we first define the global loss function and the global loss decrease (model accuracy improvement) as follows:</p>

The
physical meaning of the logarithmic function is that the magnitude of FL model’s improvement decreases with global
batchsize. That is, when a FL model possesses a large global batchsize, participants make the same effort but obtain
a low return, , which would encourage participants to contribute more when the global batchsize is small.
Note that, for ease of exposition, we adopt a specific logarithmic function in this paper.

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We first consider the contribution-oblivious FL (COFL) game model, in which all participants act on their own benefits to decide the computing resources and data batchsize for local training without imposing any contributing requirements.
Due to the heterogeneous nature among participants (e.g., differences in model preference and training cost), forging an incentive-driven collaboration strategy such that all participants are mutually satisfied is non-trivial. We will analyze the Nash equilibirum of COFL game, propose an algorithm to achieve Nash equilibrium in COFL game, and derive some insightful results.</p>

Specifically, according to best response functions in Proposition 1 above, we first capture the characteristic of the Nash equilibrium of the COFL game (Theorem <a href="#Thmthm1" title="Theorem 1 ‣ 3.2 Nash Equilibrium in COFL ‣ 3 Contribution-oblivious FL GAME ‣ Collaboration in Participant-Centric Federated Learning: A Game-Theoretical Perspective" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>), and based on which, we then obtain equivalent form of Nash equilibrium (Theorem <a href="#Thmthm2" title="Theorem 2 ‣ 3.2 Nash Equilibrium in COFL ‣ 3 Contribution-oblivious FL GAME ‣ Collaboration in Participant-Centric Federated Learning: A Game-Theoretical Perspective" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>).

In this case, the CAFL game does not have a Nash equilibrium. As a result, we will try to remove some special participants in the game such that the refined CAFL game has a Nash equilibrium.
Intuitively, these special participants can be plausible contributing participant candidates but cannot satisfy Property 5 exactly. In this case, they are very sensitive to minor changes of other participants’ decisions, causing the instable equilibrium behavior of switching between contributing (<math id="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="B_{i}=B_{th}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1a"><mrow id="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1" xref="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml"><msub id="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.2" xref="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml"><mi id="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.2" xref="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.2.cmml">B</mi><mi id="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.3" xref="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.3.cmml">i</mi></msub><mo id="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.1" xref="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><msub id="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.3" xref="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.2" xref="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.2.cmml">B</mi><mrow id="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.3" xref="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.3.cmml"><mi id="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.3.2" xref="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.3.2.cmml">t</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.3.1" xref="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.3.3" xref="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.3.3.cmml">h</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1b"><apply id="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1"><eq id="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.1"></eq><apply id="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.2">𝐵</ci><ci id="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.3">𝑖</ci></apply><apply id="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.3">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.2">𝐵</ci><apply id="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.3"><times id="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.3.1.cmml" xref="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.3.1"></times><ci id="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.3.2.cmml" xref="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.3.2">𝑡</ci><ci id="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.3.3.cmml" xref="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.3.3">ℎ</ci></apply></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.I5.i3.p1.3.m3.1c">B_{i}=B_{th}</annotation></semantics></math>) and quiting (<math id="S4.I5.i3.p1.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="B_{i}=0" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.I5.i3.p1.4.m4.1a"><mrow id="S4.I5.i3.p1.4.m4.1.1" xref="S4.I5.i3.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml"><msub id="S4.I5.i3.p1.4.m4.1.1.2" xref="S4.I5.i3.p1.4.m4.1.1.2.cmml"><mi id="S4.I5.i3.p1.4.m4.1.1.2.2" xref="S4.I5.i3.p1.4.m4.1.1.2.2.cmml">B</mi><mi id="S4.I5.i3.p1.4.m4.1.1.2.3" xref="S4.I5.i3.p1.4.m4.1.1.2.3.cmml">i</mi></msub><mo id="S4.I5.i3.p1.4.m4.1.1.1" xref="S4.I5.i3.p1.4.m4.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S4.I5.i3.p1.4.m4.1.1.3" xref="S4.I5.i3.p1.4.m4.1.1.3.cmml">0</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.I5.i3.p1.4.m4.1b"><apply id="S4.I5.i3.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.I5.i3.p1.4.m4.1.1"><eq id="S4.I5.i3.p1.4.m4.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.I5.i3.p1.4.m4.1.1.1"></eq><apply id="S4.I5.i3.p1.4.m4.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.I5.i3.p1.4.m4.1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.I5.i3.p1.4.m4.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.I5.i3.p1.4.m4.1.1.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.I5.i3.p1.4.m4.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.I5.i3.p1.4.m4.1.1.2.2">𝐵</ci><ci id="S4.I5.i3.p1.4.m4.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S4.I5.i3.p1.4.m4.1.1.2.3">𝑖</ci></apply><cn type="integer" id="S4.I5.i3.p1.4.m4.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.I5.i3.p1.4.m4.1.1.3">0</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.I5.i3.p1.4.m4.1c">B_{i}=0</annotation></semantics></math>) after the best response adjustments by others.

Based on the participants’ reported information, the server will compute the optimal equilibrium strategies with optimal threshold for the participant-centric FL using the algorithms above, and then announce the strategies to the participants. We should emphasize that each participant has incentive to follow the announced strategy due to the property of Nash equilibrium and the enforcement of contribution threshold mechanism by the FL server.</p>

In terms of potential model security issues, using validation dataset is a lightweight and economic method to check quality of the uploaded model from each participant in order to defend against data poisoning attack or model manipulation (e.g., dirty-label data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>).
In response to the backdoor attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, we can refer to three state-of-art defense mechanisms to defend it from the perspective of certified defense <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, validation datasets detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> and robust aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, respectively.

Intuitively, one potential extension is to adjust the participants’ overall model valuation parameters, since the overall non-iid level in a large-scale group is relatively static.</p>

the participants’ collaboration in FL from theoretical perspective in this paper. In realistic deployment, a participant may experience failures in terms of communication or computation disruptions probabilistically. To address such a risk-aware FL collaboration scenario, one study direction is to integrate the prospect theory <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> with our game model to analyze risk-aware decision making behaviors when facing with uncertainty.
Intuitively, risk-aware decision makings would make
the participants to be more conservative in collaboration. The rigorous analysis on this based on prospect theory is
mathematically involved and out of scope of this study. We will consider it in a future work.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p6.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.SS2.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Truthful parameter reporting</span>: the issue of participant’s truthful parameter reporting is not the focus of this work and will be considered in a future work. Intuitively, if a participant exaggerates his model valuation, he would be required to contribute more. While, if he understates his valuation excessively, he would risk at getting removed from FL. In practice, as per the prior statistical distributions of participants’ valuations, we can globally finetune the contribution threshold to balance the truthfulness and optimality.</p>

As the number of participants increases, the free-riding phenomenon becomes more and more serious, and hence performance gain (both on global batchsize and total utility) of CAFL is more superior.
For instance, CAFL can achieve up to 9x growth in terms of the global data batchsize over COFL, which also implies a significant improvement on the FL model accuracy.

<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we develop a comprehensive theoretical framework for analyzing participants’ behaviors in participant-centric federated learning. We propose the COFL game model and achieve the Nash equilibrium. To alleviate the free-riding phenomenon in COFL, we propose CAFL game model and establish a minimum threshold mechanism, which achieves the desired advantages of incentive-driven collaboration, free-riding mitigation and global efficiency boosting for participant-centric FL. We further show that optimal contribution threshold based CAFL game solution can significantly boot the amount of participation and system performance.</p>

<div id="S8.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For the future work, we are going to study the implementation issue with truthful information reporting by globally fine-tuning the contribution threshold to balance the truthfulness and optimality. We will further address the issues of model security and non-IID data for participant-centric FL.</p>
