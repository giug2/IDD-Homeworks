<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is highly susceptible to model poisoning attacks, especially those meticulously crafted for servers.
Traditional defense methods mainly focus on updating assessments or robust aggregation against manually crafted myopic attacks. When facing advanced attacks, their defense stability is notably insufficient. Therefore, it is imperative to develop adaptive defenses against such advanced poisoning attacks.
We find that benign clients exhibit significantly higher data distribution stability than malicious clients in federated learning in both CV and NLP tasks.
Therefore, the malicious clients can be recognized by observing the stability of their data distribution.
In this paper, we propose AdaAggRL, an RL-based Adaptive Aggregation method, to defend against sophisticated poisoning attacks. Specifically, we first utilize distribution learning to simulate the clients’ data distributions. Then, we use the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) to calculate the pairwise similarity of the current local model data distribution, its historical data distribution, and global model data distribution. Finally, we use policy learning to adaptively determine the aggregation weights based on the above similarities.
Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed defense model significantly outperforms widely adopted defense models for sophisticated attacks.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is a promising machine learning method where model training is distributed across multiple local devices rather than centralized on a single server. It can not only ensure the security of users’ private data but also enhance model performance by collaborating diverse data from various local sources. It finds applications in diverse scenarios, including smart healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Chaddad et al. (<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>, financial services <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Byrd and Polychroniadou (<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, IoT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Nguyen et al.

(<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. However, FL systems are vulnerable, and the performance of the aggregated model is highly susceptible to model poisoning attacks from unknown clients, especially the sophisticated poisoning strategies tailored for central servers. In this work, we focus on untargeted model poisoning attacks, where malicious devices aim to maximally reduce the accuracy of the global model by sending customized gradients to the server.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Traditional defense methods mainly rely on designing local model update assessment mechanisms or using robust aggregation methods to mitigate the impact of poisoning attacks. However, these defense methods are primarily targeted at manually crafted myopic attack strategies, and their defense stability is noticeably lacking when facing advanced attacks. For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Li et al. (<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> propose using distribution learning to simulate the data distribution of the central server and employing reinforcement learning (RL) to tailor attack policy for the aggregation process, making it less detectable, as shown in Figure <a href="#S3.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 3.2 Framework Overview ‣ 3 RL-based Adaptive Aggregation Methods ‣ Defending Against Sophisticated Poisoning Attacks with RL-based Aggregation in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>. Therefore, it is urgent to develop adaptive defenses against such learnable advanced poisoning attacks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Most benign clients exhibit significant data distribution stability in federated learning. In normal cases, the current training data distribution simulated by the parameters passed through the client should align with its historical simulated data distribution. This is because benign clients typically employ random sampling and undergo multi-round training based on their local data, ensuring the stability of the training data distribution used for global updates. However, malicious clients require gradient attacks, so its simulated data distribution between current and history lacks regularity. To validate this, we conduct a statistical analysis of mainstream attack methods, namely IPM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Xie et al. (<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, LMP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Fang et al.

(<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>, measuring the similarity of their data distribution with history after each round of updates on MNIST dataset, as shown in Figure <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_label ltx_ref_self">LABEL:fig:statistic</span>. We find that benign clients maintain higher data distribution similarity, while attack clients show no discernible patterns. We also observe the same phenomenon on NLP tasks, as shown in Appendix <a href="#A5" title="Appendix E NLP Dataset Distribution Changes Caused by Poison Attacks ‣ Defending Against Sophisticated Poisoning Attacks with RL-based Aggregation in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">E</span></a>. Therefore, malicious clients can be recognized by observing the stability of their simulated data distribution.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose an RL-based Adaptive Aggregation method, AdaAggRL, to thwart sophisticated poisoning attacks. It determines the aggregation weights of local models by comparing the stability of client data distributions. Specifically, we first use distribution learning to emulate client data distributions based on the uploaded model parameters. Next, we use the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) to calculate the pairwise similarity of the current local model data distribution, its historical data distribution, and the global model data distribution, to evaluate the stability of the client’s data distribution. Considering that the accuracy of distribution learning can potentially impact the calculation of the similarities above, we use reconstruction similarity as an evaluation metric for the quality of distribution learning. Finally, we use the policy learning method TD3 to adaptively determine the aggregation weights based on the above three distribution similarities and the reconstruction similarity of distribution learning.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">2 </span>Motivation</h2>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In most cases, benign clients’ data distribution remains stable, while malicious clients lack regularity. During FL, benign clients are selected by the server through random sampling and trained on their local data for a certain number of rounds. Therefore, the simulated data distribution obtained through gradient inversion should align with their historical distribution. But the data distribution of malicious clients lacks regularity, due to their need to conduct model attacks. To verify this, we conduct a statistical analysis of the similarity between data distributions for mainstream attack methods such as IPM, LMP, EB, and RL-attack, as shown in Figure <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_label ltx_ref_self">LABEL:fig:statistic</span>. The similarity of data distributions for benign clients remains high and stable, while malicious clients lack any regular pattern. Though the stability of advanced attack RL-attack is significantly higher than other ordinary attack methods, there are still significant differences compared to benign clients. We also observe the same phenomenon on NLP tasks, as shown in Appendix <a href="#A5" title="Appendix E NLP Dataset Distribution Changes Caused by Poison Attacks ‣ Defending Against Sophisticated Poisoning Attacks with RL-based Aggregation in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">E</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<figure id="S2.F4.sf2" class="ltx_figure">
</figure>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, we observe a certain degree of similarity between current client data distribution and global model data distribution, as shown in Figure <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_label ltx_ref_self">LABEL:fig:2</span>. The data distribution of benign clients for current steps is similar to the global model and remains stable, but the similarity of malicious clients is lower. Since the data distribution of the global model represents the average state of normal data, the distribution of benign clients should always be consistent with the global model. Instead, malicious clients do not possess this property. Though the advanced RL-attack has high similarity with the global model due to collecting the data distribution of the server, it is still not as stable as benign clients. Therefore, we can compare data distribution similarity between the current client and global model to observe variations and assess the degree of malicious behavior. Similarly, the similarity between historical distribution and global model distribution is higher and more stable for benign clients than malicious ones, as shown in Appendix <a href="#A3" title="Appendix C Supplementary Experimental Results ‣ Defending Against Sophisticated Poisoning Attacks with RL-based Aggregation in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">C</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Considering that the quality of distribution learning greatly affects the accurate calculation of these three distribution similarities, the reconstruction similarity of distribution learning is used as an evaluation metric for assessing the quality of distribution learning. Reconstruction similarity measures the similarity between the inversion gradients obtained from distribution learning and the gradients updated by clients. Higher reconstruction similarity indicates a higher level of confidence in current distribution learning.</p>

Although, for AdaAggRL, there is a slight decrease in testing accuracy as the proportion of malicious clients increases. In contrast, the remaining FL aggregation algorithms can only tolerate malicious clients below 30% under LMP attack. This indicates that AdaAggRL can maintain a relatively stable defensive performance even when facing a high percentage of malicious clients.</p>

Under non-i.i.d. condition (q=0.5), AdaAggRL’s advantage in faster convergence becomes more pronounced, particularly against IPM, LMP, and EB. In the case of LMP, baseline algorithms exhibit a certain degree of accuracy reduction, and under EB, the oscillation magnitude of C-Median’s testing accuracy increases. Especially against RL-attack, the impact of non-i.i.d. on baseline algorithms is significant, while AdaAggRL maintains relatively stable performance. This indicates the robustness of AdaAggRL in handling non-i.i.d. client datasets.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose AdaAggRL, an RL-based Adaptive Aggregation method, to counter sophisticated poisoning attacks. Specifically, we first utilize distribution learning to simulate clients’ data distributions. Then, we use MMD to calculate the pairwise similarity of the current local model data distribution, its historical data distribution, and the global model data distribution. Finally, we use policy learning to adaptively determine the aggregation weights based on the above similarities and the reconstruction similarity.
Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that AdaAggRL significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art defense model for sophisticated attacks.</p>

<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Limitations &amp; Future Work</span> AdaAggRL assumes that the simulated data distribution obtained from poisoned updates is unstable. However, if malicious clients can launch attacks based on a stable distribution, AdaAggRL may struggle to identify malicious updates by computing the similarity of simulated distributions. Therefore, future work will focus on addressing defense strategies against such covert poisoning attacks.</p>

<p id="A2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In training setup, the RL attack model first learns AD hoc attack strategies against other baseline defense methods, and then fixes the parameters. In response, we developed a temporary defense strategy to defend against this learned attack strategy. On this basis, the RL attack model refines the attack strategy against RL defense according to our AD hoc defense strategy. We then implement defensive measures based on this improved attack strategy and evaluate the effectiveness of our defense mechanisms. Despite the attacker’s awareness of the server’s utilization of RL-based defense, our algorithm remains capable of detecting fluctuations in its simulated data distribution, thus identifying malicious behavior and diminishing the attacker’s involvement in FL training, ultimately leading to their withdrawal from the training process.</p>

<p id="A2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In each round of FL training, we reconstruct 16 images from a single model update of a sampled client to simulate data distribution. The optimization process for gradient inversion is carried out for 30 iterations. However, it’s important to note that the reconstructed images are solely used to capture the distribution characteristics and are not intended for precise image reconstruction. The limited number of iterations and reconstructed images do not suffice for accurately restoring image information. Consequently, the reconstructed images do not contain discernible image details. This approach is implemented to fulfill the privacy protection requirements of FL while minimizing computational time as much as possible. The experimental results demonstrate that, under the LMP attack, when reconstructing 16 images from the MNIST dataset, the final accuracy achieves after 10 optimization iterations of gradient inversion is 0.9554, after 20 iterations is 0.9592, after 30 iterations is 0.9636, and after 50 iterations is 0.9664. When reconstructing 32 images, the final accuracy after 30 optimization iterations is 0.9628. To strike a balance between the final performance and computational resources, we opt to train using gradient inversion with 30 iterations for reconstructing 16 images. The method for gradient inversion optimization is Adam, the learning rate is 0.05, and the reconstructed images are initialized to all-zero tensors.

<p id="A3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">We observe a certain degree of similarity between the historical client data distribution and the global model data distribution, as shown in Figure <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_label ltx_ref_self">LABEL:fig:lg</span>. We find that the data distribution of benign clients for historical steps is similar to the global model and remains stable, but the similarity of malicious clients is lower. This is because the data distribution of the global model represents the average state of normal data, so the distribution of benign clients should always be consistent with the global model. Instead, malicious clients do not possess this property. Though the advanced RL-attack has a high similarity with the global model due to collecting the data distribution of the server, it is still not as stable as the benign client. While considering the similarity between the current client data distribution and the global model data distribution, we also take into account the similarity between historical client data distribution and global model data distribution. By incorporating the historical performance of clients, this approach aims to capture the subtle behaviors of lurking malicious clients engaging in attacks.</p>

<p id="A5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to verify whether the hypothesis that poisoning attacks can cause abnormal changes in the distribution of datasets reconstructed by gradient inversion is valid on NLP datasets, we select IMDB review dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> on TextCNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> framework for FL semantic classification. IPM, LMP, EB and RL-attack poisoning attacks are also carried out during training. Unlike the image data set, we record and observe changes in the distribution of embedding. Figure <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_label ltx_ref_self">LABEL:fig:nlp</span> shows the statistical results of the similarity between the current client data distribution and its historical data distributions under four types of attacks that vary with the training epochs.
It can be seen that on IMDB dataset, under different poisoning attacks, the similarity between the historical embedding distribution and the current embedding distribution of malicious clients is generally lower than that of benign clients. This result is consistent with the experimental results on image datasets.</p>
