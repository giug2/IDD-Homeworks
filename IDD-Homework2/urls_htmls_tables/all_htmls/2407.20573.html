<p id="id5.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a distributed Machine Learning (ML) framework that is capable of training a new global model by aggregating clients’ locally trained models without sharing users’ original data. Federated learning as a service (FLaaS) offers a privacy-preserving approach for training machine learning models on devices with various computational resources. Most proposed FL-based methods train the same model in all client devices regardless of their computational resources. However, in practical Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios, IoT devices with limited computational resources may not be capable of training models that client devices with greater hardware performance hosted. Most of the existing FL frameworks that aim to solve the problem of aggregating heterogeneous models are designed for Independent and Identical Distributed (IID) data, which may make it hard to reach the target algorithm performance when encountering non-IID scenarios. To address these problems in hierarchical networks, in this paper, we propose a heterogeneous aggregation framework for hierarchical edge systems called HAF-Edge. In our proposed framework, we introduce a communication-efficient model aggregation method designed for FL systems with two-level model aggregations running at the edge and cloud levels. This approach enhances the convergence rate of the global model by leveraging selective knowledge transfer during the aggregation of heterogeneous models. To the best of our knowledge, this work is pioneering in addressing the problem of aggregating heterogeneous models within hierarchical FL systems spanning IoT, edge, and cloud environments. We conducted extensive experiments to validate the performance of our proposed method. The evaluation results demonstrate that HAF-Edge significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> is a distributed learning algorithm designed for privacy-aware applications. Without compromising the user’s privacy, FL aggregates trained local models to build a new global model. In each training round, all client devices receive the global model from the cloud server, train it using local data, and send the updated model back to the server for building a new global model in the aggregation process (Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Federated Learning as a Service for Hierarchical Edge Networks with Heterogeneous Models" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>). Compared with traditional centralized training, FL alleviates concerns about direct data violation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, as the client’s original data is never transmitted to the server in the training process. In recent years, Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) has gained widespread attention, proved by the increasing demand for cloud-based machine learning platforms and large-scale analytics across various industries <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. However, the concerns of widely collecting privacy data have also grown <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. FL, as a decentralized machine learning, has the capability to face the challenges of privacy concerns. In 2020, Nicolas et al. proposed Federated Learning as a Service (FLaaS) for permission and privacy management <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. In recent years, FL has been applied in various applications such as healthcare systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, prediction maintenance for Internet of Things (IoT) devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, and edge networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Data heterogeneity among client devices is One of the major challenges in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. In practical FL scenarios, the client’s data is highly dependent on user behavior. As a result, training data on clients’ devices may have significantly different distributions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. This phenomenon is called non-Independent and Identical (non-IID) distributed data, which has a significant impact on the global model’s performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. Device heterogeneity in the computational hierarchy is another existing problem of FL. Most proposed FL frameworks require all participants to use the same model architecture regardless of their computational resources. However, in practical FL scenarios such as Google Gboard <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, mobile clients could have various hardware configurations (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>). In this setting, running the same model on all client devices is challenging, if it is not impossible. Devices with low computational resources are incapable of finishing the training process on time <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, which increases the average time for a training round as the server can perform the model aggregation when it receives trained models from all devices.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To address these research problems, various methods have been proposed to aggregate heterogeneous models within conventional Federated Learning (FL) systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. However, most of these methods cannot reach the target performance when encountering non-IID data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. In this paper, we introduce an aggregation method for heterogeneous models in three-level hierarchical FL frameworks (IoT/edge/cloud) called <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">HAF-Edge</span>. In this computational hierarchy, IoT devices are clustered based on some specific requirements (data/hardware configurations). Each cluster is connected to an edge server that receives the trained models and aggregates them to create an edge-aggregated model. All edge devices are connected to a cloud server that receives edge-aggregated models with different structures. The could server performs the second level of aggregation by using knowledge sharing and based on similarity in structures of different models to build a global model for each edge server (Figure  <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Federated Learning as a Service for Hierarchical Edge Networks with Heterogeneous Models" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>). HAF-Edge not only leverages the advantages of hierarchical federated learning, potentially reducing the need for the Internet to aggregate trained IoT models at the edge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, but also addresses the challenge of aggregating edge models with different settings at the cloud level. By connecting a cluster of IoT nodes with the same setting to an edge server using local communication technologies (e.g., Bluetooth or Zigbee), the need for using the Internet in creating edge-aggregated models is eliminated <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> (reduces communication cost). HAF-Edge addresses the challenge of <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">aggregating heterogeneous models at the cloud by adopting a strategy called Max-Common</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> in hierarchical edge networks. At the cloud level, we extract parts of the knowledge from different model settings to enhance the global model’s aggregation process. Our experimental results demonstrate that <span id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">models trained with IID data tend to have a greater distance from the global model compared to scenarios where non-IID data is used</span>. Based on this observation, we propose a distance-based weighting aggregation approach and apply it to the aggregation process at the edge level to improve performance for applications with non-IID data. The main contributions of our work are summarized as follows:</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> is a decentralized model training method that was proposed for training neural networks in a distributed fashion without sharing the user’s data. However, the existence of non-IID data among client devices in practical FL scenarios is one of the most important problems that reduces the performance of the global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. In vanilla FedAvg, only data volume is considered in the aggregation process. As a result, in practical FL scenarios with non-IID data, regardless of data distribution, the same weighting coefficient is considered for trained models of two client devices that had data with the same size but with completely different labels. Broadly aggregating the models trained with low-quality data can have a serious impact on the performance of the global model in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Some proposed methods start to shift the focus to the quality of client data or models. FAIR proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> improves the performance of the global model by filtering the local models with low quality. Moreover, a game-theoretic FL framework is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> to activate clients to provide the local models trained with high-quality data.</p>

<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In practical IoT FL scenarios, the expected local model architecture may differ among client devices due to heterogeneous hardware configurations, tasks, and personal demands <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. To address these challenges, methods such as FedMD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> and MHAT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> have been proposed based on knowledge distillation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. However, in these methods, a public dataset is created, which can compromise client data privacy. In contrast to knowledge distillation, MaxCommon <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> aggregates common layers of heterogeneous models to share learned features among participants. This approach targets heterogeneous model architectures and refines the aggregation of local updates to specific layers rather than entire models. By aggregating as many common layers as possible from different clients’ models, MaxCommon maximizes knowledge sharing. The method employs data quantity-based aggregation to merge common layers from various clients’ updates, ensuring that a client’s model with a larger training dataset contributes more to the aggregated common layers. However, this approach does not consider the distribution of local training data.</p>

A common three-level structure in FL is the client-edge-cloud model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. In this model, edge servers aggregate the received local updates from clients and then send the aggregated updates to the cloud server, which subsequently aggregates the updates from the edges to create a new global model. In hierarchical FL, IoT devices are connected to edge servers rather than directly to the cloud server (the cloud server communicates only with edge servers). One apparent advantage of hierarchical FL compared to conventional FL networks is the reduction in communication costs. By aggregating local updates within clusters first, the number of updates sent to the cloud server is minimized. Communication costs between IoT devices and edge servers are typically lower than that for the communication between IoT devices and the cloud server as local network communication technologies (e.g., Bluetooth or Zigbee) are utilized to connect IoT devices to edge servers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. Additionally, hierarchical federated learning can reduce communication latency as the aggregation process for the local network is placed at the edge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">By employing HAF-Edge, client devices are clustered based on their model architectures to ensure that IoT devices with identical model architectures are grouped into the same cluster. Each cluster of IoT devices is connected to an edge server which aggregates local models and forwards the edge-aggregated model to the cloud server. Then, edge-aggregated models with heterogeneous architectures are aggregated in the cloud by using the MaxCommon strategy. Subsequently, the cloud server distributes the updated global models with distinct architectures to corresponding edge servers. Edge servers then propagate these new global models to the IoT devices within their clusters, guaranteeing synchronized updates across edge servers and client devices (Figure <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 3 Framework Design ‣ Federated Learning as a Service for Hierarchical Edge Networks with Heterogeneous Models" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>).</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In HAF-Edge, we use the Euclidean distance-based weighting method to reduce the impact of non-IID data. In FL, under the non-IID scenario, the Euclidean distance of clients trained with skewer data distribution is lower than the models trained with balanced distributed data due to the neural network having to update more weights to capture more detailed client data features. We conducted an experiment with two different configurations:</p>

After receiving edge-aggregated models, the cloud server creates new global models with different architectures by aggregating common layers from various edge-aggregated models. New global models are distributed to matching edge servers. The edge server propagates the received new global model to connected client devices. Hence, starting from the second round, the distance-based weighting aggregation is applied at the edge server.

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In our study, we evaluate the effectiveness of HAF-Edge using MNIST and FMNIST by comparing its performance with two baselines: vanilla FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> and MaxCommon strategy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. The TensorFlow library of Python is used for implementation. In our experiment, we use heterogeneous models with different numbers of dense layers. Table.<a href="#S4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 4 Implementation and Evaluation ‣ Federated Learning as a Service for Hierarchical Edge Networks with Heterogeneous Models" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> represents the foundation model structure. The x-nn represents the model which has x number of dense layers except the output layer. As an example, 1nn and 5nn represent models that have 1 dense layer and 5 dense layers, respectively. To verify the effectiveness of our method, three different scenarios are applied to evaluate the performance of HAF-Edge. Table.<a href="#S4.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 4.1 Experiment setup ‣ 4 Implementation and Evaluation ‣ Federated Learning as a Service for Hierarchical Edge Networks with Heterogeneous Models" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> shows the detailed settings of three experiment scenarios. 1NN and 3NN models are used in Scenario 1 and Scenario 2. In Scenario 3, 5 different model architectures from 1NN to 5NN are employed. To generate non-IID training sets for the client devices in three scenarios, MNIST and FMNIST datasets are sorted according to labels and partitioned into several subsets based on the required number of non-IID client devices in different scenarios, and each subset is regarded as one non-IID client. The client device with IID data contains all labels in three scenarios.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Non-IID data and model heterogeneity are two important challenges of FLaaS. In this paper, we present HAF-Edge, a three-level hierarchical federated learning where client devices with the same model settings are clustered and connected to an edge server that aims to solve these problems. In HAF-Edge, MaxCommon strategy is adopted at the cloud server to extract and aggregate common layers from models with different architectures. A distance-based weighting aggregation is proposed and applied at edge servers to reduce the impact of data non-IIDness, which is based on our observation that the Euclidean distance between local models trained with IID data and the global model is higher compared with the local models trained with non-IID data. We also evaluate the performance of HAF-Edge based on MNIST, FMNIST datasets under multiple scenarios. The results indicate that HAF-Edge outperforms FedAvg and MaxCommon Strategy under scenarios with non-IID data and heterogeneous models.</p>
