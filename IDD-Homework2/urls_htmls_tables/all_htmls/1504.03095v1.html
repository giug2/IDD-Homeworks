<p id="id25.id1" class="ltx_p">As the most competitive solution for next-generation network, software-defined network (SDN) and its dominant implementation OpenFlow, are attracting more and more interests. But besides convenience and flexibility, SDN/OpenFlow also introduces new kinds of limitations and security issues. Of these limitations, the most obvious and maybe the most neglected one, is the flow table capacity of SDN/OpenFlow switches.</p>
<p id="id26.id2" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed a novel inference attack targeting at SDN/OpenFlow network, which is motivated by the limited flow table capacities of SDN/OpenFlow switches and the following measurable network performance decrease resulting from frequent interactions between data plane and control plane when the flow table is full. To our best knowledge, this is the first proposed inference attack model of this kind for SDN/OpenFlow. We also implemented an inference attack framework according to our model and examined its efficiency and accuracy. The simulation results demonstrate that our framework can infer the network parameters(flow table capacity and flow table usage) with an accuracy of 80% or higher. These findings give us a deeper understanding of SDN/OpenFlow limitations and serve as guidelines to future improvements of SDN/OpenFlow.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">By decoupling the control plane from the data plane, Software-Defined Network (SDN) makes programmability a built-in feature for networks, thereby introducing automaticity and flexibility to the networking management. SDN has therefore been foreseen as the key technology that enables the next generation of networking paradigm. Despite its promise, one of the most significant barriers towards SDN’s wide practical deployment resides in overwhelming security concerns. Therefore, proactively detecting, quantifying, and mitigating its security vulnerabilities becomes of fundamental importance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In spite of its novelty, SDN indeed reuses various design and implementation elements ranging from architectures and protocols to systems from traditional network. It is not surprising that SDN inheres the vulnerabilities intrinsic to these elements. For example, similar to any networked service, secure channels between controllers and switches might be disrupted by DDoS attacks; like firewall rules, the flow entries may also conflict with each other, leaking unwanted traffic; malicious arp spoofing generated by attackers may poison the controller MAC table, disturbing the normal topology information gathering and packet forwarding; untrusted applications may instrument SDN controller to perform malicious behaviors without proper access control, which is one of the design objectives for modern operating systems. In response, existing research in the context of SDN security mainly focuses on detecting and mitigating these vulnerabilities. For example,  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> evaluates man-in-the-middle attacks that target at SDN/OpenFlow secure channels; FortNOX <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> brings security enforcement module into NOX <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> and enables real-time flow entry conflict check; VeriFlow <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> detects network-wide invariant violations by acting as a transparent layer between control plane and data plane.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we introduce a novel SDN vulnerability. The novelty of this vulnerability stems from the feedback-loop nature of SDN, a fundamental difference compared with traditional networks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Specifically, most commercial SDN/OpenFlow switches have limited flow table capacities, ranging from hundreds to thousands <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Such capacity is usually insufficient to handle millions of flows that are typical for enterprise and data center networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Nevertheless, the flow table capacity was just considered as a potential bottleneck of resource consuming attacks in the past, motivating researches on flow caching systems like <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. But according to our analysis, the flow table capacity can lead to inference attack and privacy leakage under certain circumstances.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">As a consequence of flow table overflow, the SDN controller needs to dynamically maintain the flow table by inserting and deleting flow entries. The maintaining process typically include packet information transferring, routing rule calculation and flow entry deployment, which leads to measurable network performance decrease.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Particularly, once the flow table is full, extra interactions between controller and switch are needed to remove certain existing flow entries to make room for newly generated flow entries, resulting in further network performance decrease. An attacker can therefore leverage the perceived performance change to deduce the internal state of the SDN. To be more specific, we consider the scenario that an attacker resides in a network that is managed by a SDN. The attacker can then actively generate network traffic, triggering the interactions between the controller and switch with respect to flow entry insertion and deletion. The attacker can then measure the change of the network performance to estimate the internal state of the SDN including the flow table capacity and flow table usage. We have designed innovative algorithms to exploit this vulnerability and quantify their effectiveness on exploiting this vulnerability based on extensive evaluation.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Software Defined Network (SDN) is a competitive solution for next-generation network. SDN offers network programmability by separating the control plane from the data plane. Network functions like routing calculation and link discovery are extracted from switches (data plane) and implemented by centralized controllers (control plane). OpenFlow <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> is the most prominent SDN implementation.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In a SDN network, the controller gathers network topology information and makes high-level routing decisions while the switches only perform the functionality of packet forwarding according to routing rules assigned by the controller. The dedicated link connecting controller and switch is called secure channel. Controller and switch communicates via secure channel using the OpenFlow protocol. Controller also exposes network control APIs or north-bound interfaces so network administrators can write their own network management applications to more effectively run their networks.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In traditional datacenter network, the administrator needs to configure switches separately. Switches from different vendors with different managing tools become a major obstacle in network management. What’s worse, each switch only handles a fragment of the whole network, the lack of global network topology makes it impossible to optimize network traffic dynamically and globally.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Compared with traditional network, SDN reveals great potential in datacenter networks because of its attractive advantages. The SDN controller stores global network topology so that the network can be efficiently optimized. The unified network APIs provided by controller make it easy to perform network management. There have been several successful commercial deployments of SDN in datacenter networks.

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">2.3 </span>Information Leakage in Datacenter Network</h3>

<div id="S2.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In modern datacenter networks like Microsoft Azure and Amazon EC2, customer VMs are usually multiplexed across shared physical infrastructures. Besides achieving a high utilization of hardware and software resources, this approach also introduces new vulnerabilities. Previously published researches have shown that transparently shared physical infrastructures can lead to potential cross-VM information leakage.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">At first glance information leakage might seem innocuous, but in fact it is quite useful for clever attackers and will bring security issues in many aspects. The leakage of cache miss information is used in extraction and inference of RSA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> and AES <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> secret keys. The leakage of inter-keystroke time information can be used to perform recovery of the password in keystroke timing attack. The leakage of network topology might provide weapons to attackers because some attacks are only possible when attacker’s VM is executed on the same physical server with victim’s VM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. The leakage of network performance information might make it possible for commercial spies to estimate the number of visitors to a co-resident server belonging to competitors and further infer the operation situation of their company. Thus information leakage in datacenter networks is drawing more and more attentions in network security and privacy researches.</p>

<div id="S2.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Flow table is a hardware structure in OpenFlow switch, it stores hundreds to thousands of routing rules called flow entries. These flow entries are generated and assigned by the controller. Every time a network packet arrives in the switch, the switch will look up its flow table to find corresponding flow entries. If there exists a corresponding flow entry, the switch will forward the network packet according to the actions associated with that flow entry. If there is no flow entry matching this network packet, the switch will send the packet to the controller through the secure channel, then controller will calculate and generate a new flow entry and assign it to the switch.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Previous works typically assume that the flow table of each switch can hold an infinite number of flow entries, which makes the controller easy to design. In practice, however, this assumption does not hold, and the switch flow table capacity can become a significant bottleneck to scaling SDN networks. SDN/OpenFlow switch flow tables often cannot scale beyond a few hundred entries, because they typically include wildcards, and therefore are implemented using either complex and slow data structures, or expensive and extremely power-hungry ternary content-addressable memories (TCAM). Typical SDN/OpenFlow switches have rather limited flow table capacities from 750 to 3000 flow entries while handling about 100,000 concurrent flows in data centers. The flow table capacity bottleneck leads to potential flow table overflow, which is unacceptable.</p>

<p id="S2.SS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Combine the flow table capacity issue of SDN switches and the resource sharing phenomenon in SDN-based datacenter networks, we discover the possibility of performing inference attacks targeting at SDN vulnerabilities.

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">3 </span>Problem Statement</h2>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Considering the wide use of SDN/OpenFlow in data center networks, we assume the inference attack scene to be in a SDN-based multi-tenant datacenter network like Amazon EC2 or Microsoft Azure. In a SDN-based datacenter network, different tenants connected to the same switch will share the flow table space. The flow table capacity’s importance as key network parameter and the possibility of inference attack hidden behind the flow table sharing phenomenon make it natural for us to take flow table capacity as our primary inference target. Besides inferring intrinsic and static property of the switch (flow table capacity), further inference should be performed on the flow table usage condition of other tenants in the same datacenter, which reflects the real-time dynamic resource consuming situation in datacenter networks. So we choose flow table usage as our secondary inference target. But inferring flow table capacity and flow table usage is not that easy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As cloud computing infrastructures, data center networks are typically well-managed and equipped with advanced firewalls and intrusion detection systems. In order to avoid triggering the IDS, we must behave like an ordinary tenant, which means we cannot gather sensitive information or directly hack into the controller. What’s worse, with the constraints of passiveness and concealment, the available parameters for our inference attack are further limited.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">After analyzing current structure and implementations of SDN/OpenFlow, its decoupled nature gives us inspiration: the interactions between control plane and data plane will lead to network performance decrease, which can be measured through performance parameters like round trip time (RTT).</p>

The three rectangular regions surrounded by dotted line stand for three possible packet processing branches respectively. When the switch encounters an incoming packet, it will parse it and send the parsed packet into the subsequent processing pipeline.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Then as the first step of the pipeline, the switch will lookup its flow table to search flow entries matching the packet. When there is a match, the switch will directly forward the packet according to actions associated with the corresponding flow entry. This branch is illustrated in the innermost rectangle of fig <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 3 Problem Statement ‣ An Inference Attack Model for Flow Table Capacity and Usage: Exploiting the Vulnerability of Flow Table Overflow in Software-Defined Network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.</p>

<div id="S3.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p6.1" class="ltx_p">When there is no corresponding flow entry in the flow table, extra steps will be introduced into the procedure. Additional interactions between the switch and the controller will happen to acquire corresponding routing rules, including packet information transferring, routing rule calculation and flow entry deployment. The middle rectangle of fig <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 3 Problem Statement ‣ An Inference Attack Model for Flow Table Capacity and Usage: Exploiting the Vulnerability of Flow Table Overflow in Software-Defined Network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> illustrates this process.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Before the switch inserts the newly generated flow entry, it has to check the flow table status to make sure that there is enough space in the flow table. When the flow table is full, the controller has to perform flow table replacement operations to make room for the upcoming flow entry. These operations include deciding which old flow entry to delete according to certain flow table replacement algorithm and flow entry deletion. The outermost rectangle in fig <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 3 Problem Statement ‣ An Inference Attack Model for Flow Table Capacity and Usage: Exploiting the Vulnerability of Flow Table Overflow in Software-Defined Network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> stands for this branch.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p8.1" class="ltx_p">That is exactly where the vulnerability lies. In traditional networks, the switches and routers are autonomous, which means they can maintain their routing tables locally without interacting with an external device. But due to the decoupled nature of SDN/OpenFlow, maintaining switch flow tables needs frequent interactions between switches and controllers, making it possible for an attacker to leverage the perceived performance change to deduce the internal state of the SDN network.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p9.1" class="ltx_p">As shown in fig <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 3 Problem Statement ‣ An Inference Attack Model for Flow Table Capacity and Usage: Exploiting the Vulnerability of Flow Table Overflow in Software-Defined Network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, the rectangular regions surrounded by dotted line correspond to different possible packet processing branches. The larger a rectangle is, the longer the processing time of that branch will be because of the extra steps that rectangle contains. When there is a match in the flow table, the processing time will be the shortest; when there is no match in the flow table and the flow table is not full, the processing time will be longer because of addition routing calculation and flow entry deployment; when there is no match in the flow table and the flow table is full, the processing time will be the longest because a flow table replacement operation has to be performed. So as a network parameter directly influenced by the processing time, the RTT of a packet can serve as an indicator of flow table state and flow entry state.</p>

<p id="S3.p13.1" class="ltx_p">Having got a method to detect flow table state and flow entry state using the bootstrap process above, our inference model will follow a ”probe–observe–infer” pattern. We model the SDN/OpenFlow network as a black box and observe its response (RTT) to different input (network packets), then we use the response to estimate the flow table state and flow entry state and perform further inference. The whole process comes in three steps.</p>

<div id="S3.p14" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p14.2" class="ltx_p">Firstly, we send probing packets into the network to trigger the interaction.

If we send excessive probing packets in a short period of time, the flow table will overflow and then the interaction process will be triggered. Secondly, we measure RTTs of the responded packets and infer the flow table state and flow entry state. Thirdly, we use observed flow table states and flow table states as controlling signals in our inference algorithm and perform flow table capacity inference.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p15" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p15.1" class="ltx_p">But there is still one problem: how will the flow table deal with the flow entries when the flow table is full. In other words, we need to know the flow table replacement algorithm. The algorithm decides the internal state transition of a SDN network thus it’s an essential part of our inference model. Though flow table replacement algorithms of commercial SDN/OpenFlow switches are stored in their firmwares, making it impossible for researchers to read, we can still get illuminations of what the algorithms will be like by analyzing the functionalities of flow tables.</p>

<p id="S3.p16.1" class="ltx_p">Flow table in a SDN/OpenFlow switch stores the local router tables assigned by the controller. Having to achieve a hit rate as high as possible in a rather limited space, flow table serves like a ”cache” in operating systems and web proxy servers. So we have reason to believe that the flow table replacement algorithm will be some of the most popular cache replacement algorithms or their variations. In this paper we choose FIFO<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> and LRU<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> because they are common and popular.</p>

<p id="S3.p19.1" class="ltx_p">Flow entry deletion mechanism of OpenFlow includes two main parts: active flow deletion invoked by controller and passive flow deletion invoked by timeout. According to OpenFlow specification, each flow entry has two timeout values — hard_timeout and idle_timeout. Hard_timeout decides how long a flow entry will live after it has been inserted while idle_timeout means the longest time of no packet matching before a flow entry is deleted. The feasibility of our inference attack will be associated with timeout values and the feasibility analysis consists of two parts: RTT bootstrap feasibility and probing feasibility.</p>

We can detect if the flow table is full and the existence of our flow entries. Combined with the number of inserted flow entries we recorded, we can infer the flow table capacity and flow table usage.

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The experiment principle of LRU algorithm has something in common with that of FIFO algorithm, because under these two circumstances we can both keep our flow entries stay in the back of the cache queue using certain operations.However, there are still differences lies in the flow entry maintaining process.</p>

But in LRU algorithm, the positions of the flow entries depend not only on the time they are inserted, but also on the last time they are accessed.

When there isn’t corresponding flow entry existing in the flow table, the RTT of a packet will significantly increase due to the interactions between controller and switch in order to acquire new flow entries. That is the case when there is still space in the flow table. Once the flow table is full, the RTT of a packet will further increase as a result of extra flow table replacement operations. To prove the effectiveness of using RTT as the flow table state and flow entry state indicator, we measured packet RTTs corresponding to different flow table state and flow entry state.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">SDN/OpenFlow has become a competitive solution for next generation network and is being more and more widely used in modern datacenters. But considering its key role as the datacenter fundamental infrastructure, we have to admit that the security issues of SDN/OpenFlow haven’t been explored to a large extent. Especially, the flow table capacity of SDN/OpenFlow switch is only considered as a vulnerable part for DDoS and flooding attacks in published researches. But according to our analysis in previous sections, the flow table capacity can lead to potential inference attack if combined with reasonable assumptions and RTT measurements.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Firstly, we found in section <a href="#S3" title="3 Problem Statement ‣ An Inference Attack Model for Flow Table Capacity and Usage: Exploiting the Vulnerability of Flow Table Overflow in Software-Defined Network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> that exact match flow entries as well as the lack of route aggregation would consume a lot of flow table space, making it impossible to process millions of flows per seconding using SDN/OpenFlow. Secondly, we found in section <a href="#S6" title="6 Evaluation ‣ An Inference Attack Model for Flow Table Capacity and Usage: Exploiting the Vulnerability of Flow Table Overflow in Software-Defined Network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> that assigning the decision making job of flow table replacement to the controller would lead to significant network performance decrease, which had to be changed in time. Thirdly, there is currently no mature attack detection mechanism for SDN/OpenFlow network, so it’s quite easy for criminals to exploit system vulnerabilities or invoke DDoS attacks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p3.1" class="ltx_p">All these security issues call for improvements to current OpenFlow switch and flow table design. The improvements should at least contain three aspects: (1)new flow table maintaining mechanism, like transferring the flow entry deleting workload from controller to switch. Switch itself can decide which flow entry to delete and then sync with controller. In the newest OpenFlow switch specification 1.4 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, this mechanism has been added as an optional feature, but without any mature implementation so far; (2) routing aggregation. Routing aggregation can match a group of flows using one flow entry, which will reduce the flow table consuming significantly compared with exact match; (3) inference attack detection. Administrators can develop inference attack detecting applications and then perform defences like port speed limiting or network address validation.</p>

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The inference attack proposed in this paper is motivated by the limited flow table capacity of SDN/OpenFlow switches. The flow table capacity issue has been presented in many previous works like <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. They all point out the limitation of switch flow table memory and potential scalability and security issue. However, these work don’t give further analysis on the inference attack and information leakage caused by the limited flow table capacity.</p>
</div>
<div id="S8.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Kloti et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> presents potentially problematic issues in SDN/OpenFlow including information disclosure through timing analysis. However, this information disclosure requires disclosing existing flows with side channel attack, which is hard to perform in real world. Compared with their approach, our inference attack is self-contained and requires no prior knowledge.</p>
</div>
<div id="S8.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Gong et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> presents a kind of inference attack using RTT measurement to infer which website the victim is browsing. They recover victims’ network traffic patterns based on the queuing side channel happened at the Internet router. However, the scenario of their work is in the public Internet, while our approach focus on SDN/OpenFlow infrastructures in datacenter network. Compared with public Internet and website inference, the inference attack and information leakage in modern data centers is more sensitive and valuable.</p>
</div>
<div id="S8.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Shin et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> demonstrate a novel attack targeting at SDN networks. This attack includes fingerprinting SDN networks and further flooding the data plane flow table by sending specifically crafted fake flow requests in high speed. In the fingerprinting phase, header field change scanning is used to collect the different response time (RTT) for new flow and existing flow. The fingerprinting result is then analyzed to estimate if the target network used SDN technology. The RTT measurement and analysis they used in fingerprinting is similar with our approach. But they just perform DoS attacks to the SDN network, without performing any further information leakage or network parameter inference.</p>

The inference attack can be done in a completely passive way, making it hard to detect and defence. We also implemented the inference attack framework and examined the efficiency and accuracy of it using network traffic data from different sources. The simulation results show that the inference attack framework can infer the network parameter(flow table capacity and flow table usage) with an accuracy of up to <math id="S9.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="80\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S9.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S9.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S9.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S9.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S9.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">80</mn><mo id="S9.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S9.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S9.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S9.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S9.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S9.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S9.p1.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S9.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S9.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">80</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S9.p1.1.m1.1c">80\%</annotation></semantics></math> or higher.</p>
