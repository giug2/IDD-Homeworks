<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) has become a popular tool for solving traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks. The multi-agent structure addresses the major concern of data-hungry in traditional RL, while the federated mechanism protects the data privacy of individual agents. However, the federated mechanism also exposes the system to poisoning by malicious agents that can mislead the trained policy. Despite the advantage brought by FL, the vulnerability of Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) has not been well-studied before. In this work, we propose a general framework to characterize FRL poisoning as an optimization problem and design a poisoning protocol that can be applied to policy-based FRL. Our framework can also be extended to FRL with actor-critic as a local RL algorithm by training a pair of private and public critics. We provably show that our method can strictly hurt the global objective. We verify our poisoning effectiveness by conducting extensive experiments targeting mainstream RL algorithms and over various RL OpenAI Gym environments covering a wide range of difficulty levels. Within these experiments, we compare clean and baseline poisoning methods against our proposed framework. The results show that the proposed framework is successful in poisoning FRL systems and reducing performance across various environments and does so more effectively than baseline methods. Our work provides new insights into the vulnerability of FL in RL training and poses new challenges for designing robust FRL algorithms.</p>

<p id="Sx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, <span id="Sx1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Reinforcement Learning</span> (RL) has gained popularity as a paradigm for solving complex sequential decision-making problems and has been applied to a wide range of real-world problems, including game playing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Silver et al. (<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>); Vinyals et al. (<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>, autonomous driving <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Yurtsever et al.

(<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>. In RL, the agent’s goal is to learn an optimal policy that maximizes the long-term cumulative rewards, which is done by repeatedly interacting with a stochastic environment, taking actions, and receiving feedback in the form of rewards. However, despite the impressive performance of RL algorithms, they are notoriously known to be data-hungry, often suffering from poor sample efficiency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Dulac-Arnold et al. (<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>); Schwarzer et al. (<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. One traditional solution to this challenge is <span id="Sx1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Parallel RL</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Kretchmar (<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2002</a>)</cite>, which adopts multiple parallel RL agents that sample data from the environment and share it with a central server, as seen in practical implementations such as game-playing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Mnih et al. (<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>); Berner et al. (<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. However, transferring raw data may not be feasible: on the one hand, it can cause significant communication costs in applications, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Wang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>; On the other hand, it is not suitable for privacy-sensitive industries, such as clinical decision support <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Liu et al. (<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>.</p>

<p id="Sx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In order to address the limitations of traditional parallel RL, the concept of <span id="Sx1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Federated Reinforcement Learning</span> (FRL)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Fan et al.

FRL allows multiple agents to solve the same RL task collaboratively without sharing their sensitive raw data, thus addressing the drawbacks of heavy overhead and privacy violation in traditional Parallel RL. On the communication side, the communication efficiency of FRL is improved by the ability of FL to perform multiple local model updates during each communication round. On the privacy side, FRL enables data privacy protection by only communicating model updates, but not raw data, to a central server. With advantages of addressing communication efficiency and protecting privacy, FRL is practically appealing to a wide range of applications, including IoT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Wang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, autonomous driving <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Liang et al.

<p id="Sx1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the promising advantages brought by FL into RL, the <span id="Sx1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">security risk</span> is inherited from FL as well, since the lack of transparency of local training in FL naturally causes the vulnerability of the FRL system when exposed to adversarial attacks of malicious agents. While there is an extensive line of study on attacks in FL<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Fang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>); Bagdasaryan et al.

(<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>); So, Güler, and Avestimehr (<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, it has yet to be explored in the context of FRL. In this work, our goal is to <span id="Sx1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">systematically study the vulnerability of FRL systems when facing adversarial attacks that attempt to mislead the trained policy</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To address the vulnerability of FRL to adversarial attacks, we start by proposing a theoretical framework that characterizes the problem of environment poisoning in FRL as an optimization problem. The attacker is assumed to have control over a few corrupted agents and can manipulate their local environments by perturbing their observations during local policy training and updates. However, the attacker does not have prior knowledge of the underlying Markov Decision Process (MDP) of the environment and can only learn it through the agents’ observations. This type of attack is practical and can be easily implemented in real-world scenarios, such as buying an IoT device participating in an FRL system, and providing false signals to its sensors. To assess this risk, we design a novel poisoning mechanism that targets FRL with policy-based local training. We first design the poisoning for the general case and extend it to the Actor-Critic setting in which the attacker trains a set of public and private critics to manipulate the coordinator’s model during the training process. Our method is evaluated through extensive experiments on OpenGYM environments with various difficulty levels (CartPole, InvertedPendulum, LunarLander, Hopper, Walker2d, and HalfCheetah) using different policy-gradient RL models. The results demonstrate that a few malicious agents can successfully poison the entire FRL system. Furthermore, we affirm the effectiveness of our attack model compared to baseline attacks. Our findings highlight the potential risks of FRL under adversarial attacks and inspire future research toward developing more robust algorithms.</p>

<p id="Sx1.p5.2" class="ltx_p">In summary, our work indicates that when FL is applied to RL training, there is a risk of exposing the system to malicious agents, making it susceptible to poisoning and threats in applications. Consequently, the trained policy of FRL may not be entirely reliable and requires a more robust and secure protocol.</p>

<p id="Sx4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we propose practical local environment poisoning methods to FRL. We consider two scenarios when the local RL training/update in the FRL system uses actor-critic methods (Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ Method ‣ Local Environment Poisoning Attacks on Federated Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>) and policy gradient methods (Algorithm <a href="#alg2" title="Algorithm 2 ‣ Reward Poisoning with Local Policy Gradient (PG) Algorithms ‣ Method ‣ Local Environment Poisoning Attacks on Federated Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>). Here, we only describe untargeted reward poisoning methods as other variants can be easily derived from our general formulation in Section <a href="#Sx3" title="Problem Formulation ‣ Local Environment Poisoning Attacks on Federated Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_title">Problem Formulation</span></a>. Finally, in the Appendix, we provide a defense mechanism against the proposed poisoning protocols, which is based on assigning credits to each agent’s policy according to its performance.

In order to manipulate the global model by training and submitting a poisoned critic model, the attacker needs an unpoisoned critic to provide a true estimation of the value function (V-value) to make the best poison decision. To address this need, the attacker trains a pair of public and private critics, <math id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.3" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\widehat{\omega}_{(j)}^{p,q}" display="inline"><semantics id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.3a"><msubsup id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.3.4" xref="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.3.4.cmml"><mover accent="true" id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.3.4.2.2" xref="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.3.4.2.2.cmml"><mi id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.3.4.2.2.2" xref="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.3.4.2.2.2.cmml">ω</mi><mo id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.3.4.2.2.1" xref="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.3.4.2.2.1.cmml">^</mo></mover><mrow id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.3" xref="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.3.4.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.3.1" xref="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.3.4.cmml">(</mo><mi id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1" xref="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml">j</mi><mo stretchy="false" id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.3.2" xref="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.3.4.cmml">)</mo></mrow><mrow id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.3.3.2.4" xref="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.3.3.2.3.cmml"><mi id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.2.2.1.1" xref="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.2.2.1.1.cmml">p</mi><mo id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.3.3.2.4.1" xref="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.3.3.2.3.cmml">,</mo><mi id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.3.3.2.2" xref="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.3.3.2.2.cmml">q</mi></mrow></msubsup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.3b"><apply id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.3.4.cmml" xref="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.3.4"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.3.4.1.cmml" xref="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.3.4">superscript</csymbol><apply id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.3.4.2.cmml" xref="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.3.4"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.3.4.2.1.cmml" xref="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.3.4">subscript</csymbol><apply id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.3.4.2.2.cmml" xref="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.3.4.2.2"><ci id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.3.4.2.2.1.cmml" xref="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.3.4.2.2.1">^</ci><ci id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.3.4.2.2.2.cmml" xref="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.3.4.2.2.2">𝜔</ci></apply><ci id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1">𝑗</ci></apply><list id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.3.3.2.3.cmml" xref="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.3.3.2.4"><ci id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.2.2.1.1.cmml" xref="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.2.2.1.1">𝑝</ci><ci id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.3.3.2.2.cmml" xref="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.3.3.2.2">𝑞</ci></list></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.m1.3c">\widehat{\omega}_{(j)}^{p,q}</annotation></semantics></math> and <math id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.m2.3" class="ltx_Math" alttext="{\omega}_{(j)}^{p,q}" display="inline"><semantics id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.m2.3a"><msubsup id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.m2.3.4" xref="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.m2.3.4.cmml"><mi id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.m2.3.4.2.2" xref="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.m2.3.4.2.2.cmml">ω</mi><mrow id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.m2.1.1.1.3" xref="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.m2.3.4.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.m2.1.1.1.3.1" xref="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.m2.3.4.cmml">(</mo><mi id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.m2.1.1.1.1" xref="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.m2.1.1.1.1.cmml">j</mi><mo stretchy="false" id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.m2.1.1.1.3.2" xref="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.m2.3.4.cmml">)</mo></mrow><mrow id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.m2.3.3.2.4" xref="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.m2.3.3.2.3.cmml"><mi id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.m2.2.2.1.1" xref="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.m2.2.2.1.1.cmml">p</mi><mo id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.m2.3.3.2.4.1" xref="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.m2.3.3.2.3.cmml">,</mo><mi id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.m2.3.3.2.2" xref="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.m2.3.3.2.2.cmml">q</mi></mrow></msubsup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.m2.3b"><apply id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.m2.3.4.cmml" xref="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.m2.3.4"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.m2.3.4.1.cmml" xref="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.m2.3.4">superscript</csymbol><apply id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.m2.3.4.2.cmml" xref="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.m2.3.4"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.m2.3.4.2.1.cmml" xref="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.m2.3.4">subscript</csymbol><ci id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.m2.3.4.2.2.cmml" xref="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.m2.3.4.2.2">𝜔</ci><ci id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.m2.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.m2.1.1.1.1">𝑗</ci></apply><list id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.m2.3.3.2.3.cmml" xref="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.m2.3.3.2.4"><ci id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.m2.2.2.1.1.cmml" xref="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.m2.2.2.1.1">𝑝</ci><ci id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.m2.3.3.2.2.cmml" xref="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.m2.3.3.2.2">𝑞</ci></list></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.2.m2.3c">{\omega}_{(j)}^{p,q}</annotation></semantics></math>.

Our results show that the proposed poisoning method can effectively reduce the mean episode reward of the server in the FRL system. Additionally, our poisoning protocol does not require knowledge of the MDP of the environment and is consistent with the multiple local steps setting of FRL.</p>

<div id="Sx6.SSx2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx6.SSx2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Here, we present experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed poisoning method compared to a clean setup, compare it to other poisoning methods, and assess the impact of the system size on the success of the attack. We show that with a small proportion of malicious agents, our method is able to poison most FRL systems successfully. Additionally, we observe its consistent outperformance compared to other poisoning methods across algorithms and environments. Lastly, we demonstrate that the proportion of malicious agents remains a critical factor in the success of the attack, regardless of the overall size of the system.</p>

<div id="Sx6.SSx2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx6.SSx2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For the VPG algorithm (Fig. (<a href="#Sx5.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ A Theoretical Performance Guarantee ‣ Local Environment Poisoning Attacks on Federated Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>)), we see that across several environments, the attacker successfully poisons a system of 3-4 agents using our method. The effectiveness of this poisoning depends on the environment. For instance, we can observe a very clear difference between clean and poisoned runs for CartPole, but not as much for InvertedPendulum. Nevertheless, there is less consistency in the rewards for InvertedPendulum, and as the rounds progress, the clean run would continue to accumulate greater mean rewards. We also observe that our method performs at least as well and, in most cases, much better than a random attack in poisoning the system. This proves the capability of our VPG attack method in poisoning federated systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx6.SSx2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx6.SSx2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Attacking a PPO system (Fig. (<a href="#Sx6.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ Numerical Experiments ‣ Local Environment Poisoning Attacks on Federated Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>)) lends itself to a much different dynamic because the separate value parameters allow all agents to learn more effectively, and thus we expect both clean and malicious agents to be more successful in their opposite goals. Ultimately, we observe that malicious agents using our method are much more successful in their attacks across environments compared to the VPG results. We attribute this to the more sophisticated attack model, which reduces noise in the gradient updates and enables the reward poisoning to be more effective. In contrast, we see that a random attack performs very poorly, as the strength of the clean agents overwhelms the weak attack and results in high rewards over time.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx6.SSx2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx6.SSx2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, we conduct extensive experiments, investigating other attack aspects on the performance of the FRL, such as larger attack budget, attacker proportion generalization, targeted attack, and single-critic attack. In particular, we provide a defense mechanism to robustify the FRL system under certain attack environments. Due to space limitations, we defer all those results to the supplementary document.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">Conclusions</h2>

<div id="Sx7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we propose a novel method for poisoning FRL under both general policy-based and actor-critic algorithms, which can provably decrease the system’s global objective. Our method is evaluated through extensive experiments on various OpenGYM environments using popular RL models, and the results demonstrate that our method is effective in poisoning FRL systems. Our work highlights the potential risks of FRL and inspires future research for designing more robust algorithms to protect FRL against poisoning attacks.</p>

For each model uploaded to the server, we ran it for 10 episodes and collected the mean reward per episode. We then used the normalized rewards as the weights of aggregation. The results show that while the defense method can improve the rewards of a poisoned model, there is still a significant gap compared to the clean baseline during the training process. Figure (<a href="#Sx9.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ PPO Preliminaries ‣ Appendix B: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-Specific Framework ‣ Local Environment Poisoning Attacks on Federated Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>) suggests that the defended FRL system is often protected from poisoning attacks but cannot reach as good as clean training. Furthermore, it is still vulnerable in complex environments such as Half Cheetah. This highlights the need for designing more robust FRL mechanisms in the future.</p>

We test an alternative with only one critic that both attacks and has its rewards poisoned. To test the effectiveness of our two-critic PPO attack, we also test a single-critic approach, in which the critic poisons the rewards for both the policy and itself using its value function and gets aggregated and updated by the central server after each round. Using the same runs as presented above, we compare this alternative attack compared to ours.
