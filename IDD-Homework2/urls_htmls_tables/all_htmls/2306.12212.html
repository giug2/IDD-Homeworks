<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id4.id1.1" class="ltx_text">Federated learning (FL) is a promising framework for privacy-preserving collaborative learning, where model training tasks are distributed to clients and only the model updates need to be collected at a server. However, when being deployed at mobile edge networks, clients may have unpredictable availability and drop out of the training process, which hinders the convergence of FL. This paper tackles such a critical challenge. Specifically, we first investigate the convergence of the classical FedAvg algorithm with arbitrary client dropouts. We find that with the common choice of a decaying learning rate, FedAvg may oscillate around a stationary point of the global loss function in the worst case, which is caused by the divergence between the aggregated and desired central update. Motivated by this new observation, we then design a novel training algorithm named MimiC, where the server modifies each received model update based on the previous ones. The proposed modification of the received model updates mimics the imaginary central update irrespective of dropout clients. The theoretical analysis of MimiC shows that divergence between the aggregated and central update diminishes with proper learning rates, leading to its convergence. Simulation results further demonstrate that MimiC maintains stable convergence performance and learns better models than the baseline methods.</span></p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The resurgence of deep learning (DL) intensifies the demand for training high-quality models from distributed data sources.
However, the traditional approach of centralized model training may raise severe concerns of privacy leakage, since data, possibly with personal and sensitive information, need to be collected by a server prior to training.
As a result, federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, which is a privacy-preserving distributed model training paradigm, has recently received enormous attention <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
A typical FL system consists of a central server and many clients with private data, which collaborate to accomplish an iterative training process.
In each training iteration, clients train local models based on their local data and upload the model updates to the server. Upon receiving the model updates, the server performs model aggregation and the aggregated global model is disseminated to clients for the next training iteration.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Depending on the types of clients, FL systems can be categorized as the cross-device and cross-silo settings <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
In this work, we focus on cross-device FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> where clients are usually edge devices (e.g., smartphones and wearables) with a relatively small volume of local data.
Cross-device FL fits well with the new era of pervasive artificial intelligence (AI) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, which utilizes the distributed computational resources for real-time and cost-effective big data analytics.
Note that clients of cross-device FL may have heterogeneous resources such as computing power, battery capacity, and network quality <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
Therefore, they may occasionally drop out of the training process for some iterations because of various unpredictable events, which is termed as <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">client dropout</span>.
For example, mobile devices may run out of battery or be disconnected from the server.
In such cases, only a subset of clients are able to complete local training and upload the model updates in each training iteration, which significantly degrades the convergence performance and training speed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The problem of client dropout has been tackled in the context of distributed learning, where a model training task is intensionally divided and allocated to multiple computing nodes (i.e., clients) by a server.
To guarantee satisfactory learning performance, the global dataset is usually partitioned such that training data on clients are independent and identically distributed (IID) in distributed learning. However, while a small fraction of dropout clients can be tolerated with IID training data, significant dropouts severely impair the training efficiency and slow down the convergence speed.
Techniques such as coded computing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> and using backup clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> combat dropouts in distributed learning by redistributing training data and assigning redundant training tasks to clients.
Nevertheless, client dropouts in FL cause some critical and unique challenges.
Firstly, the local data on clients are non-IID.
The non-IIDness cannot be mitigated since the local data are not allowed to be transferred to other clients or the server because of privacy concerns.
Also, simply ignoring the inactive clients leads to a biased global update in each training iteration.
In other words, if some clients drop out, the aggregated update will be biased towards the training data of the successful clients and thereby deviates from global training objective, which degrades the learned model performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ MimiC: Combating Client Dropouts in Federated Learning by Mimicking Central Updates" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> shows a simple cross-device FL system with five clients to illustrate this issue, where we assume there are ten classes of data samples in total, but each client has only four classes of data.
We observe that when clients 2 and 5 drop out, the aggregated update fails to exploit the information about classes 4 and 5.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">It is worth noting that client dropout is different from active client sampling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, as the latter assumes the server is able to select a portion of clients to participate in each training iteration.
This is plausible due to an implicit premise that all the clients are available to be selected.
However, if some selected clients drop out of training unexpectedly, the server can only aggregate the received updates and obtain a biased update that deviates from the desired global gradient.
One possible approach to deal with client dropouts in cross-device FL is to use the memorized latest updates as a substitute for those dropout clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.
Nevertheless, when some clients have been inactive for a long time, the global model may have changed substantially and thus the memorized updates suffer from strong staleness.
In contrast, the deviation of each local update from the central one is primarily determined by the difference between the local and global training objectives.
Since the objective bias should not change, intuitively the deviation of each update remains relatively stable throughout the training process, as will be explained in Section <a href="#S5" title="5 Proposed Algorithm: MimiC ‣ MimiC: Combating Client Dropouts in Federated Learning by Mimicking Central Updates" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>.
As such, we aim to utilize such deviation to correct the individual updates from clients and mimic a central update.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we review the exiting works on two research directions of FL that are closely related to our current study, including: 1) cross-device FL with partial client participation; and 2) techniques combating client dropouts in distributed and federated learning.</p>

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Cross-device FL with partial client participation.</span>
The cross-device FL systems usually consist of a large number of clients and only a fraction of them are able to participate in the training process at each iteration due to the limited communication and computational resources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.
To ensure model convergence, there are two popular client sampling strategies, including: 1) to sample clients with replacement with respect to preset probabilities; 2) to sample clients without replacement uniformly at random.
These strategies guarantee that the weighted sum of the sampled clients’ objectives is an unbiased estimate of the global training objective.
However, in realistic applications, it is hard to implement these strategies due to arbitrary client dropouts, which makes the training objective biased in the presence of non-IID data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.3" class="ltx_p">Recently, Ruan <span id="S2.p3.3.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> investigated the convergence performance of FedAvg with strongly convex loss functions in practical scenarios where clients have various participating behaviors.
Specifically, the clients are allowed to have various local steps in each training iteration and those clients with a local step of zero can be viewed as dropout clients.
It is shown that by controlling the aggregation weights FedAvg with client dropouts can still converge to the global optimum, which, however, required the prior knowledge of client participation probabilities.

In practice, these conditions are difficult to verify and need laborious hyperparameter tuning.
In addition, another thread of works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> designed various client sampling strategies to accelerate the convergence rate of FL.
These works, however, are beyond the scope of this paper, since they assume clients can be actively selected to participate in the training process.</p>

<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Combating client dropouts in distributed and federated learning.</span>
In distributed learning, client dropouts can be handled via coded computing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, which carefully designs the training tasks on clients to introduce some levels of redundancy, such that the dropout clients can no longer cause fatal effects on training.
However, these methods either assume IID data or require to redistribute the training data among clients, which may be contradictory to the privacy-preserving principle of FL.
Motivated by coded computing for distributed learning, recent works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> proposed to construct coded datasets at clients, which are then transmitted to the server or other clients to compensate for the missing model updates of dropout clients.
Nevertheless, coded data transmission may bring additional communication overhead and be risky of privacy leakage.
Similarly, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> resorted to Shamir’s secret sharing for the coded data, which retains the privacy protection of conventional FL.
However, the substantial communication overhead in these designs is intolerable especially with thousands of clients in cross-device FL systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In addition to coded computing techniques, some other strategies can be adopted to combat client dropouts in FL.
The simplest strategy of combating client dropouts in FL is to only aggregate the received updates. This passive approach, however, significantly deteriorates the convergence performance due to the biased aggregated update.
Besides, another strategy is to adopt the latest updates from inactive clients as substitutes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.
Nevertheless, the memorized updates with significant staleness may degrade the training performance in the current iteration.
Alternatively, the local update from another client with similar data can be used as substitute for that of a dropout client <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. However, this approach requires to compute the pair-wise similarity between any two clients, which leads to a high computation cost.
We also notice that there is another line of studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> on privacy-preserving schemes for cross-device FL with client dropouts.
Specifically, to achieve a target level of differential privacy (DP) in FL with random client dropouts, Jiang <span id="S2.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> designed an “add-then-remove” approach to determine the noise levels of local gradients.
Moreover, a privacy-preserving aggregation scheme for FL was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, which is resilient to client dropouts with the aid of Shamir’s secret sharing.
However, these works have not implemented any mechanism to compensate the missing model updates of dropout clients and still suffer from degraded model performance.</p>

<p id="S5.p2.4" class="ltx_p">Given the limited resources of clients in cross-device FL, we should avoid introducing additional computation or communication workload to them.
Besides, since the server cannot perceive the client dropouts in advance, it is difficult to take preventative actions, e.g., assigning a higher training workload to a client that may become unavailable later.
Therefore, we propose to exploit the gathered updates at the server by monitoring the training drifts in previous iterations.

For the general case, the mini-batch gradients can be viewed as unbiased estimates of the full-batch gradient, while the effect of multiple local steps can also be bounded.
Therefore, the applied update for each client mimics the central update.

If there are a large number of clients, the proposed MimiC algorithm can be implemented in an alternative way to amortize the computation and memory overhead at the server, where the clients correct their gradient updates locally and upload the modified gradients. To be specific, each client stores a local correction variable <math id="S5.p6.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math"

The active probability of a client may be determined by various factors, e.g., the communication link quality and local computation workloads.

<p id="S6.p9.1" class="ltx_p">The conventional FL algorithms are hard to ensure convergence in the critical scenario with arbitrary client dropouts.
To preserve model convergence in this scenario, existing methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> utilize the memorized latest updates as a substitute for those dropout clients, which suffers from the staleness of local updates.
In contrast, our proposed method MimiC corrects the local updates by mimicking an imaginary central update.
By doing so, we can achieve substantial training performance improvement as verified by the simulation results in Section <a href="#S7" title="7 Performance Evaluation ‣ MimiC: Combating Client Dropouts in Federated Learning by Mimicking Central Updates" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>, in additional to the theoretical convergence guarantee.</p>

In MIFA, the server stores the latest model update for each client and uses it for aggregation in case of client dropout. Other algorithms are benchmark FL training algorithms but not specialized for combating client dropouts.
It is also worth noting that SCAFFOLD requires each client to upload two updated variables and thus incurs double communication cost in each training iteration compared with other methods.
Hence, we evaluate the accuracy of different algorithms on the test dataset with respect to the same amount of communication costs (i.e., the number of model uploadings) for fair comparisons.

We observe that the test accuracy of FedAvg, FedProx, and SCAFFOLD suffer from different degrees of oscillation over training iterations due to drastic alternation of active clients, which is more obvious in the harder CIFAR-10 training task.
This is because these algorithms lack a dedicated mechanism to deal with random client dropouts.
In contrast, MimiC and MIFA avoid this issue via different client dropout mitigating strategies and thus converge to better global models.
Compared with MIFA, MimiC achieves both improved model accuracy and training efficiency since it effectively corrects the received updates to mimic an imaginary central update.</p>

As shown in Fig. <a href="#S7.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 7.2 Results ‣ 7 Performance Evaluation ‣ MimiC: Combating Client Dropouts in Federated Learning by Mimicking Central Updates" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, when clients have larger active probabilities, the test accuracy of the learned model increases as more informative gradients are collected.
However, uploading more gradients means more communication costs, verifying the trade-off between the model accuracy and communication cost.
In all cases, MimiC consistently outperforms the baselines since it mitigates the negative impacts of client dropout via effective model update correction.</p>

Compared with the first scenario, the assumption of client availability is much relaxed. However, most FL algorithms still show unstable convergence behavior because of low client availability.
Similar to the observations in Figs. <a href="#S7.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 7.2 Results ‣ 7 Performance Evaluation ‣ MimiC: Combating Client Dropouts in Federated Learning by Mimicking Central Updates" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> and <a href="#S7.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 7.2 Results ‣ 7 Performance Evaluation ‣ MimiC: Combating Client Dropouts in Federated Learning by Mimicking Central Updates" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, both MIFA and MimiC effectively mitigate the negative effects of client dropout, and MimiC converges to a more accurate model with a faster speed.
In addition, we see that SCAFFOLD may fail to converge in the difficult CIFAR-10 training task, as shown in Figs. <a href="#S7.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 7.2 Results ‣ 7 Performance Evaluation ‣ MimiC: Combating Client Dropouts in Federated Learning by Mimicking Central Updates" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> and <a href="#S7.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ 7.2 Results ‣ 7 Performance Evaluation ‣ MimiC: Combating Client Dropouts in Federated Learning by Mimicking Central Updates" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>, since it suffers from the accumulated gradient estimation error caused by the client dropout.</p>

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we investigated the cross-device federated learning in the presence of arbitrary client dropouts. We first proved that in this critical scenario, the classical FedAvg algorithm is not guaranteed to converge with the common choice of a decaying learning rate.
This unsatisfactory performance motivated the design of a new federated learning algorithm named MimiC, where each applied update is corrected via previous updates to mimic the imaginary central update without needing the client availability pattern.
We showed that with a proper choice of the learning rates, MimiC converges to a stationary point of the global loss function.
The extensive simulations demonstrated that MimiC consistently outperforms the baselines in various scenarios, in addition to having the theoretical convergence guarantee.
For future work, it is worth investigating how to fuse the staleness-aware model aggregation schemes with MimiC to further improve its training performance.</p>
