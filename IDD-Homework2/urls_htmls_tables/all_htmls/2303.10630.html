<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Training Deep Learning (DL) models require large, high-quality datasets, often assembled with data from different institutions. Federated Learning (FL) has been emerging as a method for privacy-preserving pooling of datasets employing collaborative training from different institutions by iteratively globally aggregating locally trained models. One critical performance challenge of FL is operating on datasets not independently and identically distributed (non-IID) among the federation participants. Even though this fragility cannot be eliminated, it can be debunked by a suitable optimization of two hyper-parameters: layer normalization methods and collaboration frequency selection. In this work, we benchmark five different normalization layers for training Neural Networks (NNs), two families of non-IID data skew, and two datasets. Results show that Batch Normalization, widely employed for centralized DL, is not the best choice for FL, whereas Group and Layer Normalization consistently outperform Batch Normalization. Similarly, frequent model aggregation decreases convergence speed and mode quality.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The constant development of Information and Communication Technologies has boosted the availability of computational resources and data, leading us to the Big Data era, where data-driven approaches have become a fundamental aspect of everyday decisions. Both computational resources and data are ubiquitous and inherently distributed. All public and private sectors, from scientific research to companies, take benefit from a vast amount of diverse data to support the growth of their business and to develop more accurate Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Data is often spread and segregated in silos across different institutions and even different business units of the same organization. It is essential to make data accessible to all the partners to train high-quality models and exploit the entire data’s value <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Many recent open science works have encouraged data sharing between institutions in order to improve research possibilities, create collaborations and publish reproducible results. For example, data sharing across countries has been a crucial information tool during the CoViD-19 pandemic <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, data is often not shareable due to issues like privacy, security, ownership, trust and economic reasons. For instance, the European regulation GDPR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> places stringent constraints on the possibility of sharing sensitive data between parties; industrial companies do not share their data because leveraging it is seen as a competitive advantage. Also, exposing data to other institutions can raise concerns like lack of ownership and lack of trust.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To address these problems, model-sharing strategies (MSS) have emerged as an alternative to data sharing. In MSS, the idea is to share AI models between the involved parties in order to achieve collaboration without sharing raw data. In these approaches, the AI model can range from simpler Machine Learning (ML) algorithms like linear regression to more complex models such as those learned by Deep Learning techniques using Neural Networks (NNs). Recent years have seen the growth of different model-sharing approaches ranging from the ”model-to-data remote access” approaches to Federated Learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. In ”model-to-data remote access” approaches, AI models are run remotely directly on the machines that hold the data and security is enforced by leveraging secure remote connections and Trusted Execution Enviroments (TEEs) enclaves. Federated Learning has also emerged as a popular approach. In FL, the involved parties collaborate by aggregating locally trained models into a globally shared one. The process is usually iterative and based on NNs (FedAvg) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, even if recently methods based on non-NN distributed boosting algorithms have been proposed  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. These algorithms allow parties to aggregate any kind of model without making assumptions about the kind of model being aggregated or assuming a training procedure based on gradient descent <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">FL is a distributed ML technique originally proposed by Google in 2016 to deal with sensitive data of mobile devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
FL is an iterative version of model-sharing: clients (the data owners) create a federation (hence the name) together with the server and build a shared model based on the following steps: <em id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">1)</em> clients send their metadata, like the number of classes, training set size, test set size and shape of the input features, to the server, that initializes a model based on the received metadata characteristics; <em id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">2)</em> the server sends the initialized model to all the participants of the federation; <em id="S1.p5.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">3)</em> after performing one or more steps of gradient descent, clients send the trained model back to the server; <em id="S1.p5.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">4)</em> server acts as an aggregator performing a combination (a function like average, sum, maximum, minimum and so on) of the received models. The aggregated model is now sent to the clients, and steps <em id="S1.p5.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">3)</em> and <em id="S1.p5.1.6" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">4)</em> are repeated until a specified number of rounds are performed, or a convergence criterion is met. The first proposed FL algorithm is the FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> algorithm, where the aggregation function used to combine models is the average. In this way, all datasets are kept within the proprietary organizations, and the only information that gets exchanged is the model parameters, that in the case of NN, are matrices of floating point numbers representing the weights and the biases associated with the neurons.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning performs well when the data is independently and identically distributed (IID) among the involved institutions. Unfortunately, real-world data is often non-IID, and it is well known that this scenario poses critical issues to FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. In a non-IID setting, the data statistics of a single client may be unrepresentative of the global statistics and make the model diverge from the intended solution. Interestingly, Huang at al. show that if the loss surface of the optimization problem is both smooth and convex (which is hardly true in a real scenario), then FedAvg will also converge when the data is non-IID <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Recent works have proposed several FL algorithms to cope with non-IIDness problems, such as FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, FedNova <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, SCAFFOLD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, and FedCurv <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, which has been tested in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Notice that all these algorithms are modified versions of FedAvg and they preserve the principle underneat FedAvg: to average the weights in all the layers of the NN. Most of the common NN architectures employ Batch Normalization (BN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, a technique for improving the training of NNs to make them converge faster and to a more stable solution. BN works by standardizing the layers’ input for each mini-batch.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we investigate two aspects of the training FL models which, differently from cenytralized case, they happen to be hyper-parameters that can be optimized: the normalization layers and the frequency of models aggregation (epochs per round). We show that the most popular normalization layer (BN) does not couple well with FL for non-IID data and that substituting BN with alternative normalization FL a better model can be produced for both the non-IID and IID case. We also show that building a global model aggregating local models at each epoch is not a good strategy, neither for quality of the model nor for the execution time. We experiment with two network architectures and five different normalization layers on two public image datasets: MNIST <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> and CIFAR-10 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.
Results show that the performance of the networks is strictly related to the type of normalization layer adopted.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The main challenges in FL are statistical heterogeneity (non-iidness) and systems heterogeneity (variability of the devices of the federation). In this work, we address the former. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, the most common non-IID data settings that are quantity skew, labels quantity skew (prior shift), feature distribution skew (covariate shift), same label but different features and same features but different labels, are reviewed. To the best of our knowledge, there are only a few benchmarks for FL dealing with non-IID data. Li et al. in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> report the analysis of FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, FedNova <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> and SCAFFOLD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> on nine public image datasets, including MNIST <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> and CIFAR10 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, split according to three of the previous mentioned non-IID partition strategies, i.e. quantity skew, labels quantity skew and three different versions of feature distribution skew: noise-based, synthetic and real-world feature imbalance. Authors show that none of those algorithms outperforms others in all the cases and that non-iidness degrades the performance of FL systems in terms of accuracy, especially in the case of labels quantity skew. Another recent work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> reports an empirical assessment of the behaviour of FedAvg and FedCurv <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> on MNIST, CIFAR10 and MedMNIST <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Datasets are split according to the same non-IID settings of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Authors show that aggregating models at each epoch is not necessarily a good strategy: performing local training for multiple epochs before the aggregation phase can significantly improve performance while also reducing communication costs. FedAvg produced better models in most non-IID settings despite competing with an algorithm explicitly developed to deal with these scenarios (FedCurv).</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.4" class="ltx_p">Results in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> also confirmed literature sentiment: labels quantity skew and its pathological variant are the most detrimental ones for the algorithms. The same non-IID partitions have already been tested in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, which proposes a novel technique of non-gradient-descent FL on tabular datasets.
Our paper extends <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, deepening the experiments about the number of epochs per round, a hyper-parameter that, if tuned appropriately, can lead to large performance gains. Moreover, we aim to investigate which type of normalization layer better fits FL on non-IID data. Indeed, when data are non-IID, batch statistics do not represent the global statistics, leading NNs equipped with BN to poor results. The most common alternatives to BN are: Group Normalization (GN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, Layer Normalization (LN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, Instance Normalization (IN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> and Batch Renormalization (BRN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. To the best of our knowledge, there are no works benchmarking normalization layers for FL on non-IID data. A previous work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, proposing a novel form of Transfer Learning through test-time parameters’ aggregation, shows that a NN with Batch Normalization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> does not learn at all, while performance improves only when using Group Normalization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.8" class="ltx_p">Batch Normalization has seen a recent extensive adoption by neural networks for their training. The key issue that BN tackles is Internal Covariate Shift (ICS), which is the change in the distribution of the data (or network activations), i.e. the input variables of training and test sets. Informally, at each epoch of training, weights are updated, input data are different, and the algorithm faces difficulties. This results in a slower and more difficult training process because lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization are then required. BN attempts to reduce ICS by normalizing activations to stabilize the mean and variance of the layer’s inputs. This accelerates training by allowing the use of higher learning rates and reduces the impact of the initialization. During training, BN normalizes the output of the previous layers along the batch size, height and width axes to have zero mean and unit variance:</p>

Normalized activations will depend on the other samples contained in the minibatch. In the test phase, BN can not calculate statistics; otherwise, it will learn from the test dataset, so it uses the moving averages of minibatch means and variances of the training set. In the case of IID mini-batches, statistical estimations will be accurate if the batch size is large; otherwise, inaccuracies will be compounded with depth, reducing the quality of the models. Non-IID data can have a more detrimental effect on models equipped with BN because batch statistics do not represent global statistics, leading to even worse results. Therefore there is a need to investigate alternatives to BN that can work well with non-IID data and small batch sizes.</p>

BRN is an augmentation of a network which contains batch normalization layers with a per-dimension affine transformation applied to the normalized activations to ensure the match between training and inference models. Reducing the dependence of activation of each sample with other samples in the minibatch can result in a performance increase when data are non-IID.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The most common non-IID data settings are reviewed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> that lists five different partitioning strategies: 1) quantity skew, 2) labels quantity skew (prior shift), 3) feature distribution skew (covariate shift), 4) same labels but different features and 5) same features but different labels. In this paper, we consider the same distributions tested in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> apart from quantity skew, which is not treated. Indeed, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> showed that quantity skew does not hurt the performance of FL models, probably because it results in a different quantity of samples per client, but the distribution of samples is uniform, which is easy to deal with. In this paper, labels quantity skew, which is the most detrimental to the FL models’ performance, has been extensively tested in a lot of scenarios to show how it is possible to overcome its difficulties. The cases adopted (both IID and non-IID) are briefly described.</p>

This especially happens when dealing with real FL applications where clients of the federation are distributed among different world regions. Certain data are present only in some countries, leading to the labels quantity skew. In this work, we adopted the simplest version of labels quantity skew, where each client holds samples belonging to only a fixed amount of classes. In our experiments, we used two as number of classes per client. Other versions of labels quantity skew can be the Dirichlet labels skew (each client holds samples such that classes are distributed according to the Dirichlet function) and the Pathological labels skew (data are firstly sorted by label and then divided in shards).</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our experiments have been realized using OpenFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, the new framework for FL developed by Intel Internet of Things Group and Intel Labs. OpenFL is a Python 3 library for FL that enables organizations to collaboratively train a model without sharing sensitive information. OpenFL is DL framework-agnostic. Training of statistical models may be done with any deep learning framework, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, via a plugin mechanism.
OpenFL is based on a Director-Envoy workflow which uses long-lived components in a federation to distribute more experiments in the federation. The Director is the central node of the federation. It starts an Aggregator for each experiment, sends data to connected collaborator nodes, and provides updates on the status. The Envoy runs on Collaborator nodes connected to the Director. When the Director starts an experiment, the Envoy starts the Collaborator to train the global model.
All the experiments were computed in a distributed environment with ten collaborators. Each collaborator is run on an Intel Xeon CPU (8 cores per CPU), 1 Tesla T4 GPU. The code used for experimental evaluation is publicly available at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/alpha-unito/Benchmarking-Normalization-Layers-in-Federated-Learning-for-Image-Classification-Tasks-on-non-IID" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_href">https://github.com/alpha-unito/Benchmarking-Normalization-Layers-in-Federated-Learning-for-Image-Classification-Tasks-on-non-IID</a>.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This subsection presents the results of the three data partitioning scenarios presented: uniform, labels quantity skew and covariate shift. <a href="#S5.T3" title="In V-A Normalization Layers and non-IID data ‣ V Experiments ‣ Experimenting with Normalization Layers in Federated Learning on non-IID scenarios" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Table</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a> shows that normalization levels have a huge impact on the performance of a NN, ranging from very poor levels to almost reaching the level of accuracy in the centralized case.
ResNet-18-LN performs slightly better than BN and GN while outperforming IN and BRN in the uniform setting (<a href="#S5.F1.sf1" title="In Figure 1 ‣ V-A Normalization Layers and non-IID data ‣ V Experiments ‣ Experimenting with Normalization Layers in Federated Learning on non-IID scenarios" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">fig.</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1a</span></a>). In both the labels quantity skew and the covariate shift scenarios, both GN and LN outperform all the other normalization layers; however, they require more training steps to converge, as shown in <a href="#S5.F1.sf2" title="In Figure 1 ‣ V-A Normalization Layers and non-IID data ‣ V Experiments ‣ Experimenting with Normalization Layers in Federated Learning on non-IID scenarios" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">fig.</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1b</span></a> and <a href="#S5.F1.sf3" title="In Figure 1 ‣ V-A Normalization Layers and non-IID data ‣ V Experiments ‣ Experimenting with Normalization Layers in Federated Learning on non-IID scenarios" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">fig.</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1c</span></a>.
IN does not learn in FL; indeed, since both MNIST and CIFAR10 have ten classes, ResNet-18-IN’s performance is like tossing a coin.
BRN seems to have a very long learning curve; in fact, it needs a lot of training rounds to reach convergence. However, its performance is still far from the best performances of BN, GN and LN. For this reason, the following subsections will report results only for the most promising normalization layers: BN, GN and LN.</p>

In all three variants, the accuracy degrades when the batch size becomes too large (in almost all cases, there is a significant drop in performance when passing batch size 256 to 512). A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that, as stated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, ”the lack of generalization ability is due to the fact that large-batch methods tend to converge to sharp minimizers of the training function”. This is especially true in contexts such as FL, where clients have fewer data than in centralized scenarios, and therefore increasing the batch size has a greater effect.</p>

<div id="S5.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">It can be noted that models take benefit from more local steps of gradient descent before doing aggregation. Indeed, accuracy increases as E increases. A possible explanation is that this happens because clients of the federation share a similar loss function shape, and going more and more towards the local minima can be beneficial to reach global optima.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Interestingly, when E=1, BN converges quickly, while GN and LN require more training steps to converge. However, when E increases to 10 or 100, BN also requires more rounds to reach convergence, while the learning curves of GN and LN are unaffected by significant changes.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS3.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">These results can also be analyzed from a communication point of view: with the same amount of epochs, less communication achieves better results. For example, on CIFAR10, ResNet-GN with E=2 and 500 rounds achieves higher accuracy than ResNet-GN with E=1 and 1000 rounds (Fig.<a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ V-C Normalization layers and number of epochs per round ‣ V Experiments ‣ Experimenting with Normalization Layers in Federated Learning on non-IID scenarios" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>).
This means that perhaps counter-intuitively, training locally before performing aggregation can boost the model’s accuracy. This seems to indicate that pursuing local optimizations can lead to better approximations of the local optima. However, at a certain point, increasing E and reducing the number of rounds decreases the performance. This pattern is clearly visible with all the normalization layers and in both datasets. <a href="#S5.T8" title="In V-C Normalization layers and number of epochs per round ‣ V Experiments ‣ Experimenting with Normalization Layers in Federated Learning on non-IID scenarios" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Table</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VIII</span></a> shows that we always need an appropriate ratio of epochs to round.</p>

Indeed, when the number of parties is small, the amount of local data increases, leading to better local models, and also aggregating fewer models can result in less information loss. Moreover, we can note the importance of normalization layers in FL: GN and LN variants of ResNet-18 in the ten clients scenario perform better than BN in a two clients scenario on CIFAR10, while on MNIST there is only a slightly drop.

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This work aims to improve the effectiveness of federated learning, focusing on hyper-parameter optimization, starting from understanding which hyper-parameters specifically affect the training of a federated model differently from centralized training. We specifically focused on layer normalization, which is also a hyper-parameter of centralized training, and frequency of model aggregation, which is not an issue in centralized training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We experimented with two network architectures and five normalization layers on two public image datasets. We tested Batch, Group, Instance, Layer Normalization and Batch Renormalization in the uniform, label quantity skew and covariate shift settings. Although BN is the state-of-the-art for classical ML techniques, in our experiments, GN and LN outperformed the other normalization layers in all the FL partitioning strategies.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Through extensive experimentation, we analyzed how the batch size, the number of epochs per round, the number of rounds and the number of clients of the federation affect the aggregated model performance. These additional tests have been conducted in the labels quantity skew scenario, which is the most challenging for FL algorithms, considering the best three normalization layers: BN, GN and LN.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p4.1" class="ltx_p">GN and LN outperform BN in almost all the tests. Results show that regardless of the batch size, GN and LN consistently outperform BN, although batch size affects the model’s performance in all cases. Unexpectedly, we observed that the plot of the quality of the model against the frequency of model aggregation (epochs per round) consistently exhibits a maximum at a few epochs per round. For FL, the number of epochs per round exhibits similar behaviour of batch size for centralized training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Eventually, we tested the scalability of FL systems. We noted that FL is not scalable under strong scalability assumption, i.e. increasing the number of clients while maintaining constant the size of local datasets. However, GN and LN on ten clients still outperform BN on two clients. The scalability has also been tested in the IID scenario under the weak scalability assumption, i.e. increasing the number of clients while maintaining constant the size of the local dataset per client. In this case, the federation’s data changes with the number of clients, and the model’s performance increases with the number of parties.</p>
