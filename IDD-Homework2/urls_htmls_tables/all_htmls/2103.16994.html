<p id="id5.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a collaborative machine learning paradigm, which enables deep learning model training over a large volume of decentralized data residing in mobile devices without accessing clients’ private data. Driven by the ever increasing demand for model training of mobile applications or devices, a vast majority of FL tasks are implemented over wireless fading channels. Due to the time-varying nature of wireless channels, however, random delay occurs in both the uplink and downlink transmissions of FL. How to analyze the overall time consumption of a wireless FL task, or more specifically, a FL’s delay distribution, becomes a challenging but important open problem, especially for delay-sensitive model training. In this paper, we present a unified framework to calculate the approximate delay distributions of FL over arbitrary fading channels. Specifically, saddle point approximation, extreme value theory (EVT), and large deviation theory (LDT) are jointly exploited to find the approximate delay distribution along with its tail distribution, which characterizes the quality-of-service of a wireless FL system. Simulation results will demonstrate that our approximation method achieves a small approximation error, which vanishes with the increase of training accuracy.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The phenomenal development of wireless networking and machine learning technologies yields huge volume of sensory data at the wireless edge networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Meanwhile, as the computational power and storage of mobile devices keep growing, mobile edge computing (MEC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> is becoming a crucial technology for future networks to enable ultra-low power and ultra-low latency applications at the edge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. By integrating federated learning (FL) and edge computing with enhanced privacy and security guarantees, federated edge learning has recently been receiving increasing attention to provide services and intelligence at the edge. This is achieved by training machine learning models across a fleet of participating distributed mobile devices without transferring their local private data to a remote centralized server at either the edge or cloud. FL thus becomes a key technique to support the paradigm shift from “connected things” to “connected intelligence” in 6G, where humans, things, and intelligence are intertwined within a hyper-connected cyber-physical world <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. This inspires extremely exciting 6G applications, including industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), Internet of Vehicles (IoV), and healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. However, the deployment of FL in wireless networks, poses unique challenges in terms of system heterogeneity, statistical heterogeneity, and trustworthiness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. In particular, due to the fading nature and limited resources of wireless channels, communication-efficiency becomes a key performance indicator to implement FL at scale in wireless networks with low-latency, privacy and security guarantees.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To address the communication challenges in wireless FL, a growing body of recent works has demonstrated the effectiveness of joint optimizing communication, computation and learning across wireless networks. The analysis and design of wireless FL systems can be typically divided into two categories: analog and digital communication protocols. Specifically, by exploiting the signal superposition property of a wireless multiple-access channel, analog FL has recently received particular interest to implement low-latency global model aggregation (e.g., the weighted average function computation) via over-the-air computation (AirComp). This scheme can significantly reduce the communication bandwidth consumption and improve spectrum efficiency via concurrent transmission of locally updated models.
However, the channel noise in the AirComp based model aggregation procedure yields a completely different type of distributed FL algorithms with iterative noise. It turns out to be difficult to characterize the convergence rates, complexity, optimality and statistical behaviors of the noisy FL algorithm iterates, for which various communication-efficient analog distributed algorithms were developed with convergence guarantees, e.g., analog gradient methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, quantization schemes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, and gradient sparsification approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
Moreover, resource allocation becomes critical to improve the learning convergence rate and model prediction accuracy in wireless FL, including the transmission power control <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, model aggregation beamforming <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, and device scheduling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. However, analog wireless FL system normally requires a strict synchronization at the symbol level and the aggregation procedure of the underlying distributed learning algorithms is inherently corrupted by channel noise.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In contrast, digital wireless FL systems are able to leverage advanced coding schemes and mobile edge computing techniques, thereby achieving channel noise robustness and low-latency transmission during the distributed wireless FL procedure. Various communication network architectures, e.g., single-server, hierarchical and decentralized wireless FL systems, have recently been proposed to improve the communication efficiency and learning performance. In particular, numerous research efforts have been made to minimize the training delay of single-server FL systems, including device scheduling policies for mitigating the stragglers (i.e., the training bottleneck caused by the slowest participating devices) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, resource allocation for improving the transmission efficiency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, adaptive aggregation for dynamically controlling the aggregation frequency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> or calibrating aggregation weights <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, batchsize selection for improving learning efficiency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, and incentive mechanisms for reducing the side effects of information asymmetry <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. To further address the heterogeneity in terms of computation and communication capabilities across devices, hierarchical FL was advocated to orchestrate nodes for cooperative learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>. To this end, a partial model aggregation approach was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> to cope with communication bottlenecks, while a collaborative FL was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> for enabling on-device learning with less reliance on a central server. Besides, to improve the system robustness and alleviate the straggler effect, a decentralized device-to-device communication enabled FL network architecture was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, which is supported by radio resource allocation and computation loads adjustment.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Although there have already been a number of published works related to the delay minimization in both analog and digital transmission schemes, a delay distribution analysis has not yet been carried out for wireless FL systems. Indeed, delay distribution is critical and has profound implications for resource budgeting and timeout probability assessment under delay constraints. In this paper, we shall propose a novel framework to characterize the delay distribution analysis in wireless FL systems, for which we conceive a versatile saddle point approximation based method. Specifically, we first characterize the distribution of one user’s uplink delay by the saddle point approximation method. Based on the characteristics of the synchronous and asynchronous downlink transmission schemes, the distributions of one iteration delay are further obtained along with the distributions of the overall delay. Besides, extreme value theory (EVT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> and large deviation theory (LDT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> are also exploited to reveal the asymptotic properties of the delay distribution in wireless FL systems. To address the challenge in theoretically deriving the accurate number of convergence rounds, we model the number of convergence rounds as a random variable in lieu of a constant, followed by using an empirical distribution to investigate the overall delay in the general wireless FL systems with nonconvex FL models.</p>

Such solution basically consists of two main steps, i.e., local update and global aggregation. Specifically, the local update is the process in which learning tasks are computed based on local datasets, while the global aggregation is achieved by updating the global model using the uploaded users’ local model updates, followed by broadcasting the global parameters to them. This procedure repeats until convergence.

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">From above discussions on FL, we can see that communication between end users and BS is critical for local and global model updates. Specifically, users upload their local model parameters to the BS via uplink transmission for global model update, while BS broadcasts the updated global model parameters to all users via downlink transmission. Due to the limited resources and deep wireless channel fading, the transmission procedure can not be accomplished without delay. In this subsection, we shall present the transmission and computation model in details.</p>

From the above analysis, we can see that in the synchronous downlink scheme there are two time alignments among all users during one iteration. The first one is downlink time alignment because of the synchronous downlink scheme, while the second one is one iteration time alignment because the global model aggregation can not start until all users’ local model parameters are uploaded to the BS.</p>

Comparing these results with that of the synchronous downlink scheme, we find that the asynchronous downlink scheme has better performance on one iteration delay than the synchronous downlink scheme. This is reasonable as the asynchronous downlink scheme fully uses each user’s channel gain instead of the worst one. However, since the channel coefficient is i.i.d. over the time slots, the uplink delay of the asynchronous downlink scheme will exhibit no difference with that of the synchronous downlink scheme in terms of statistical results. Meanwhile, the downlink delay is relatively small as we analyzed above. Hence, the performance gain on reducing one iteration delay in the asynchronous downlink scheme is limited.

<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In particular, synchronous and asynchronous downlink transmission schemes were further proposed in wireless FL systems, followed by the definitions of the one iteration and overall delay. To characterize the accurate approximation and asymptotic properties of delay distributions in wireless FL systems, saddle point approximation, EVT and LDT methods were exploited. Moreover, we proposed to model the convergence rounds as a random variable instead of a constant, yielding a novel way to provide an empirical distribution for the overall delay in wireless FL systems.
The proposed modeling and analytical tools for the delay distribution provide a novel research direction to better understand and design wireless FL systems in both practical and theoretical aspects. Future promising research directions include improving the resource efficiency and users’ experience by leveraging the presented analytical results in this paper.</p>
