Autonomous driving cars using federated learning (FL) has the ability to enable different smart services. Although FL implements distributed machine learning model training without the requirement to move the data of devices to a centralized server, it its own implementation challenges such as robustness, centralized server security, communication resources constraints, and privacy leakage due to the capability of a malicious aggregation server to infer sensitive information of end-devices. To address the aforementioned limitations, a dispersed federated learning (DFL) framework for autonomous driving cars is proposed to offer robust, communication resource-efficient, and privacy-aware learning. A mixed-integer non-linear (MINLP) optimization problem is formulated to jointly minimize the loss in federated learning model accuracy due to packet errors and transmission latency. Due to the NP-hard and non-convex nature of the formulated MINLP problem, we propose the Block Successive Upper-bound Minimization (BSUM) based solution. Furthermore, the performance comparison of the proposed scheme with three baseline schemes has been carried out. Extensive numerical results are provided to show the validity of the proposed BSUM-based scheme.</p>

These emerging IoE applications are brain-computer interaction, haptics, autonomous connected vehicles, among others <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Autonomous driving cars are expected to offer a wide variety of striking features in the foreseeable future because of the remarkable prevalence of emerging technologies. Autonomous driving cars can offer prominent smart safety features, e.g., traffic sign detection, lane departure warning, collision avoidance, and instant car accident reporting. Other than safe driving features, infotainment services using intelligent caching can be achieved within autonomous driving cars. Such features can be enabled via effective machine learning schemes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Several studies used centralized machine learning for enabling different services in autonomous driving cars <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. However, there is an inherent issue of privacy leakage in machine learning schemes based on centralized training. The reason for this is the transfer of devices data to the centralized server for training. Coping with the privacy leakage issue of centralized machine learning, <em id="S1.p1.4.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">federated learning (FL)</em> was introduced that is based on the training of a global machine learning model without transferring data, but only sends learning parameters from devices to a centralized server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Therefore, we can use FL in autonomous driving cars to offer various learning capabilities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. On the other hand, there are scenarios where continuous interaction with data-generating devices is necessary for training a machine learning model. Specifically, <math id="S1.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="4000" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p1.2.m2.1a"><mn id="S1.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S1.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">4000</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p1.2.m2.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S1.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p1.2.m2.1.1">4000</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p1.2.m2.1c">4000</annotation></semantics></math> gigaoctet of data is generated by cars every day <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. One time training of a centralized machine learning model might not produce good results. Additionally, autonomous cars generally have strict latency applications (e.g., autonomous cars accident reporting that require instant analytics at edge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>). Therefore, edge intelligence (i.e., one of the key enabler of <math id="S1.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="6" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p1.3.m3.1a"><mn id="S1.p1.3.m3.1.1" xref="S1.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml">6</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p1.3.m3.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S1.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p1.3.m3.1.1">6</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p1.3.m3.1c">6</annotation></semantics></math>G <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>) and FL seems to be a promising solution for the training of a machine learning model for autonomous driving cars enabled by <math id="S1.p1.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="6" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p1.4.m4.1a"><mn id="S1.p1.4.m4.1.1" xref="S1.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml">6</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p1.4.m4.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S1.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p1.4.m4.1.1">6</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p1.4.m4.1c">6</annotation></semantics></math>G.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To enable robust FL for autonomous driving cars over a wireless network, we can use blockchain-based FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. In a typical blockchain-based FL, a devices set transmits the local model updates towards the miners installed at base stations (BSs). After trustful sharing of local models among miners, the blockchain is used for storing to learning model updates in a secure way. Finally, after completion of the blockchain consensus algorithm, every BS transmits devices local models to its associated devices for global aggregation. However, reaching a consensus among miners have a high latency issue that is not desirable for autonomous driving car scenarios. Therefore, we can use distributed nodes (e.g., BS) for autonomous driving cars that can directly share learning model updates with each other via fast back-haul links without using blockchain and thus, avoid high-latency due to consensus algorithm. On the other hand, resource optimization in the FL process can be enabled via hierarchical learning fashion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. However, the hierarchical federated learning has a robustness issue due to the use of centralized aggregation. Other than robustness and resource optimization, we must tackle the privacy leakage issue of FL. Differential privacy preservation scheme was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> to offer enhanced privacy preservation in FL by adding noise to local updates prior to their transmission. Differential privacy-based FL might suffer from prolonging in convergence time. Therefore, we must propose new schemes that must not prolong the FL convergence time.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To cope with the aforementioned challenges, we propose a dispersed federated learning (DFL) framework for autonomous driving cars. The proposed framework offers enhanced robustness due to its decentralized aggregation nature. DFL is based on computing sub-global models within various groups (e.g., people within autonomous cars). The users of a group perform learning of their local models and send them to access points within cars for sub-global aggregations. All the end-devices downloads the sub-global models and update their local models. This iterative process is carried out for fixed sub-global iterations. The next step is share the sub-global models among various cars using roadside units (RSUs). Finally, global aggregation takes place at all RSUs which sends the model to the cars. Furthermore, our DFL offers us with the additional advantage of better privacy preservation compared to the traditional FL. One can easily infer sensitive information of end-devices from local models (i.e., at the sub-global servers). On the other hand, it is extremely difficult for a global server to infer devices information from sub-global model updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Other than privacy, the reuse of already occupied resource blocks by cellular users is more feasible with low transmit power due to close vicinity nature of the devices used for sub-global model computation. To the best of our knowledge, we are first to consider DFL in autonomous driving cars to offer robust, privacy-aware, and resource optimization.</p>

Our formulated problem minimizes DFL cost by optimizing resource allocation, power allocation, and association of autonomous cars to RSUs. Our problem remains non-convex even after relaxing resource allocation and association variables from binary to continuous variables.

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we focus on resource optimization in wireless FL. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, Khan <span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> surveyed incentive mechanism and resource optimization in FL for edge networks. In another study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, Tran <span id="S2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> discussed the optimization model and analysis of wireless FL. The authors considered a problem to jointly minimize computing time and energy consumption for FL. Additionally, two trade-offs such as (a) energy consumption of device and FL model computation time, and (b) computation and latencies in communication as per the accuracy level of learning, were discussed. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, Chen <span id="S2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> studied FL over wireless networks. Specifically, loss in global FL model accuracy due to channel uncertainties were studied. A problem was considered to optimize transmit power, user selection, and resource allocation for reducing the packet error error in wireless FL. The authors provided a detailed analysis of PER on the wireless FL accuracy and proved the closed-form expression of the expected FL convergence rate. Using the derived closed-form expression, the optimization problem is simplified and is solved via the Hungarian algorithm. Furthermore, the authors discussed the implementation complexity of their proposed scheme. In another study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, Wang <span id="S2.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> considered FL for edge networks. A control algorithm under resource budget constraints that offers a trade-off between global parameter aggregation and local update for minimizing the loss function, was proposed. Validation of their algorithm was carried out using a real dataset through simulation results and prototype implementation.</p>

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, a hierarchical FL was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Their system model was based on a single MBS and several SBS. Initially, the sub-global model is computed at every SBS, which is then sent to the MBS. To further enhance the communication efficiency, the authors considered gradient sparsification and periodic averaging in their proposed hierarchical FL model. The authors validated their model using CIFAR-<math id="S2.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="10" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.p2.1.m1.1a"><mn id="S2.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">10</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.p2.1.m1.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p2.1.m1.1.1">10</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.p2.1.m1.1c">10</annotation></semantics></math> dataset which showed a significant increase in communication efficiency with almost similar learning model accuracy as compared to traditional FL.

First, local model computation takes place at a set of devices and sending to the miners. The job of the miners is to exchange local model updates in a secure way using blockchain and cross verification. Next, a block is generated having local model updates and send back to devices by the miners. Finally, a global update takes place on every device. The authors performed an end-to-end latency analysis and validated their proposal using numerical results. Although blockchain-based FL can offer trustful verification of wireless FL devices, the blockchain consensus algorithm has an inherent high latency.</p>

In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, BSUM was introduced that is based on a generalization of block coordinate descent (BCD). BSUM expands the application of BCD to a broader prospect. For BCD, it’s difficult to solve non-convex optimization problems. On the other hand, BSUM can be applied easily for non-convex problems. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, tun <span id="S2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> considered a joint content caching and resource allocation for virtualized wireless networks. They have formulated a problem to minimize the overall delay experienced by mobile virtual network operators end-users. They used BSUM for resource allocation, power control, and cache decision while minimizing the overall delay experienced by MVNO end-users. Another work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> considered control, caching, computation, and communication in mobile edge computing. To jointly optimize network latency and bandwidth usage, the authors formulated an optimization problem. Due to the non-convex nature of the formulated problem, the authors proposed a BSUM-based solution was proposed to minimize the latency and bandwidth usage by optimizing computational offloading (i.e., from end-devices to edge server and between edge servers) and data caching. Their proposed BSUM-based schemes showed promising results. In this paper, we use a BSUM-based solution to solve our formulated optimization because of its effectiveness in solving complex optimization non-convex optimization problems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we present our DFL framework for vehicular networks. As mentioned earlier that autonomous cars generate a significant amount of data every day. Therefore, using centralized machine learning with one-time training might cause performance degradation. Additionally, sending an enormous amount of generated data will consume significant communication resource. Therefore, FL can be a promising candidate for autonomous driving cars. However, FL has its own challenges. These challenges are robustness, wireless security, high communication resource consumption for training. To enable FL with robustness, wireless security, and communication resource-efficient, we propose a DFL framework for autonomous driving cars. The proposed DFL (presented in Fig. <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ II Related Works ‣ A Dispersed Federated Learning Framework for 6G-Enabled Autonomous Driving Cars" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>b) has the following steps:</p>

Within autonomous car, the local models computed by devices are sent to their corresponding access points, where aggregation of the local model takes place for obtaining a sub-global model. The sub-global model is then sent back to the associated devices and thus, the sub-global model is updated in an iterative manner. In our paper, we assume a fixed iterations for computing a sub-global model for all autonomous driving cars. In the proposed DFL framework, we can have learning model weights deviation at the sub-global level and global level. These learning model weights deviation is strictly dependent on the data heterogeneity fashion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. To tackle this issue of weight deviations due to data heterogeneity, one must use an effective aggregation scheme.</p>

First of all, weights are initialized at access points of autonomous cars which share them with their associated devices (line-1). Next, all the cars compute their sub-global models in a parallel fashion (lines 2-10). Within every car, local learning models are computed and shared with access points to yield a sub-global model. This sharing of learning models between end-devices and access points is in an iterative manner (lines 4-7). The sub-global models are sent to the RSUs next to sub-global model computation. Finally, RSUs share learning model updates with each other and perform global model computation at every RSU (line-12).</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">BCD algorithm can be considered as a special case of the BSUM algorithm. BSUM operation is based on successive updating blocks of primary variables with the aim of maximizing the upper-bound function of the original objective function. We can use BSUM for solving linear/ non-linear coupling constraints based on convex optimization problems that are separable. In detail, an iterative update of every variables block is performed for minimizing the upper-bound proximal function prior to converging for a joint stationary solution and piece-wise minimum. For a stationary solution to be coordinate-wise minimum, the block of variables should reach a minimum point <math id="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\boldsymbol{v}^{*}=\boldsymbol{v}_{j}^{t+1}" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><msup id="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.2.2" xref="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml">𝒗</mi><mo id="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.2.3" xref="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml">∗</mo></msup><mo id="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><msubsup id="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.2.2" xref="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.2.2.cmml">𝒗</mi><mi id="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.2.3" xref="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.2.3.cmml">j</mi><mrow id="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.3" xref="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2" xref="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2.cmml">t</mi><mo id="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.3.1" xref="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.3.1.cmml">+</mo><mn id="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.3.3" xref="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.3.3.cmml">1</mn></mrow></msubsup></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1"><eq id="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.1"></eq><apply id="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.2">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.2.2">𝒗</ci><times id="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.2.3"></times></apply><apply id="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.3">superscript</csymbol><apply id="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.2.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.3">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.2.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.2.2">𝒗</ci><ci id="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.2.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.2.3">𝑗</ci></apply><apply id="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.3"><plus id="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.3.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.3.1"></plus><ci id="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2">𝑡</ci><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.3.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.3.3">1</cn></apply></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS1.p8.1.m1.1c">\boldsymbol{v}^{*}=\boldsymbol{v}_{j}^{t+1}</annotation></semantics></math> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.</p>

We have formulated a cost function that takes into accounts for transmission latency and effect of PER on FL performance. Additionally, we have formulated a MINLP optimization problem to minimize DFL cost via joint resource allocation, association, and power allocation. Due to NP-hard and non-convex nature of the formulated problem, we have proposed BSUM-based solution because of its powerful nature in solving non-convex, complex problems. In addition, we have provided extensive numerical results to validate our proposal. We concluded that DFL can be employed for various intelligent transportation applications by providing FL in a robust, resource efficient, and privacy-aware manner. Furthermore, we concluded that DFL can serve as a practical application of FL for other <math id="S7.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="6" display="inline"><semantics id="S7.p1.2.m2.1a"><mn id="S7.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S7.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">6</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S7.p1.2.m2.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S7.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.p1.2.m2.1.1">6</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S7.p1.2.m2.1c">6</annotation></semantics></math>G applications.</p>
