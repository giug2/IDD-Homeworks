<p class="ltx_p" id="id2.id1">Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are pushing an increasing interest and development when dealing with eco-driving systems. In this framework, this paper presents a method to define speed profiles specifically designed for Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) systems on buses. GLOSA aims to optimize traffic flow by providing vehicles with real-time speed recommendations synchronized with traffic signal timings. Leveraging statistical analysis of experimental data collected from an urban bus, the study develops a methodology to extract meaningful insights into bus behaviour and traffic dynamics. The proposed approach considers road topology, scheduled bus stops, and signal timings to define simple although suitable speed profiles considering the peculiarities of the motion of a bus in an urban scenario. Through extensive data collection robust statistical data are defined, allowing the definition of vehicle motion profile for effectively develop and implement GLOSA systems. This research contributes to the advancement of Intelligent Transportation Systems by providing realistic data and practical insights for optimizing bus operations in urban environments.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p1.1">The latest advancements in vehicle automation have revealed significant potential for enhancing traffic management via Advanced Driver Assist Systems (ADAS), benefiting both safety and environmental considerations. Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) systems represent a significant application in the Cooperative-Intelligent Transportation System (C-ITS) field adopting Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication technology <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20261v1#bib.bib8" title="">8</a>]</cite>. Specifically, Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) systems present an opportunity by providing real-time speed recommendations to vehicles, aiming to synchronize their movement with traffic light timings. This synchronization not only reduces fuel consumption, emissions, and travel time but also improves overall traffic flow <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20261v1#bib.bib1" title="">1</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20261v1#bib.bib7" title="">7</a>]</cite>. However, current GLOSA implementations predominantly target private vehicles, lacking the necessary customization to deal with urban bus peculiarities and its interaction with the infrastructure.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p2.1">The literature nowadays addresses quite extensively the GLOSA, and C-ITS in general, for conventional vehicles like cars. At the same time, within this framework, there is emerging research starting to involve also the public transportation vehicles. The focus for buses is typically posed either on the comfort and regularity of the service for passengers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20261v1#bib.bib5" title="">5</a>]</cite> or on the energy consumption which is reduced by adopting suitable speed profiles for the vehicle, thus avoiding unnecessary stops<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20261v1#bib.bib6" title="">6</a>]</cite>.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20261v1#bib.bib12" title="">12</a>]</cite> introduced an eco-driving strategy tailored for connected electric buses at signalized intersections, incorporating bus stops to underscore the advantages of multi-objective optimization in reducing energy consumption. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20261v1#bib.bib3" title="">3</a>]</cite> energy-saving profile planning for connected and automated electric buses is addressed, leveraging non-linear programming techniques to optimize speed profiles while considering motor characteristics. Beyond adjusting vehicle speed via GLOSA systems, alternative approaches like Transit Signal Priority (TSP) systems aim to extend traffic light green times and reduce red times during bus intersection negotiations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20261v1#bib.bib10" title="">10</a>]</cite>. Additionally, the concept of Green Light Optimal Dwell Time Advisory (GLODTA) suggests increasing bus dwell time at stops <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20261v1#bib.bib2" title="">2</a>]</cite>. Many studies advocate for a combined approach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20261v1#bib.bib13" title="">13</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20261v1#bib.bib4" title="">4</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20261v1#bib.bib9" title="">9</a>]</cite>, aiming to harness the comprehensive benefits of multiple systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p3.1">In terms of modeling bus trajectories, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20261v1#bib.bib6" title="">6</a>]</cite> distinguishes between the impact areas of bus stops and signalized intersections, ultimately formulating an optimization problem aimed at minimizing energy consumption through the use of the Dijkstra algorithm. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20261v1#bib.bib12" title="">12</a>]</cite> provide instead a comprehensive description of the bus stop negotiation process, taking into account the necessary time required for the vehicle to decelerate approaching the stop and to accelerate upon resuming its journey. All these studies showcase the increasing interest and progress in refining speed advisory systems for urban buses, highlighting the importance of customized strategies to enhance energy efficiency as well as passengers’ comfort within public transportation networks.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S3.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S3.p1.1">The present section is intended to report the results of the statistical analysis conducted on the basis of the data collected throughout the whole year. Indeed, the focus is on the dwell time the vehicle spends in correspondence with the 16 bus stops along the considered route (i.e., a portion of the route followed by the circular trolley-bus line 90/91 which goes around the city of Milan).
Thanks to vehicle localization and the date-time reconstruction from recorded timestamps, it was possible to identify the bus stops along the path and cluster the dwelling times. It is worth mentioning on the one hand that the stop condition is detected by the combined matching of the following three conditions: (1) vehicle position located in the <math alttext="\pm" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" id="S3.p1.1.m1.1"><semantics id="S3.p1.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">±</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.p1.1.m1.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1">plus-or-minus</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.p1.1.m1.1c">\pm</annotation><annotation encoding="application/x-llamapun" id="S3.p1.1.m1.1d">±</annotation></semantics></math> 20 meters around the bus stop position; (2) null vehicle speed and (3) opening of at least one of the four doors for passengers. On the other hand, samples associated with a stop duration shorter than 5 seconds and longer than 30 seconds are discarded, as they most likely are either not significant or affected by external factors.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S3.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S3.p2.2">As mentioned, the data are categorized according to the day of the week and the time of the day. In particular, the weekdays are divided into the following four clusters: (1) <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S3.p2.2.1">h 7-10</span>; (2) <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S3.p2.2.2">h 10-16</span>; (3) <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S3.p2.2.3">h 16-19</span>; (4) <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S3.p2.2.4">h 19-7</span>. These clusters are associated with different peak and off-peak hours for workers and students. During the weekend days, the day hours are divided just for the morning (i.e., <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S3.p2.2.5">h 7-13</span>) and the afternoon (i.e., <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S3.p2.2.6">h 13-19</span>), keeping the same cluster for the night hours (i.e., <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S3.p2.2.7">h 19-7</span>).

It is worth specifying that for some bus stops, especially when dealing with the weekend clusters, the data are not reported as the number of significant samples was limited or badly distributed, making the GEV fitting unreliable. As can be observed from the statistical data, some trends with the time of the day can be barely inferred. Indeed, the central hours of the day (i.e., <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S3.p3.1.1">h 10-16</span>) are characterized by a higher flow of passengers, making the dwelling time longer on average. On the other hand, there seems to be a not-so-evident difference between week-days and weekend-days, as the route is part of a quite busy portion of the city with a considerable amount of passengers throughout the whole day.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.p1.1">As reported in the previous section, the information about the dwell time for every bus stop as a function of the date-time opens the possibility of designing speed profiles suitable for GLOSA implementation of public transport vehicles such as buses (B-GLOSA). In this case, the vehicle motion optimization has to consider that it is going to stop for sure at a given known point. Moreover, common GLOSA algorithms typically look for an optimal speed allowing the vehicle to cross the upcoming intersection with the green light is on. Within this process, the dwelling time of the bus is an additional variable to be taken into account when dealing with B-GLOSA design. As a result, having on this quantity a robust statistics to rely on, allows simplifying the modeling taking as a reasonable assumption a known constant dwelling time.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S4.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.p2.2">In this paper, four different possible speed profiles are proposed to address the B-GLOSA implementation. For the speed profile design, these quantities are assumed to be known: initial vehicle state (i.e., location along the path and speed), traffic light phases (i.e., minimum and maximum time available to reach the intersection with green light), bus stop location and corresponding dwell time (i.e., coming from statistics presented in Section <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20261v1#S3" title="3 Statistical Analysis ‣ Speed Profile Definition for GLOSA Implementation on Buses Based on Statistical Analysis of Experimental Data This work is part of the project ”Joint Research Lab per la Mobilità urbana”.

As far as the most suitable speed profile is concerned, it can be split into two sections: an initial one from the initial point to the bus stop and a final one from the bus stop up to the upcoming intersection. Each of these two sections is assumed to be either a simple uniformly accelerated motion or a uniformly accelerated motion followed by a constant speed motion. As a result, combining these options together, the four possible speed profiles shown in Fig. <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20261v1#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4 Speed profile definition ‣ Speed Profile Definition for GLOSA Implementation on Buses Based on Statistical Analysis of Experimental Data This work is part of the project ”Joint Research Lab per la Mobilità urbana”.

<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.p2.1">It is worth highlighting that, since the acceleration for the second section of the profile (i.e., from stop to intersection) is fixed, the whole section is constrained by the geometric characteristic of the path (i.e., the distance between stop and traffic light).

<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.p1.1">This research paper presented a robust statistical analysis based on real-world data collection throughout an entire year from an instrumented trolley bus during its regular passenger service. The outcome of these statistical results in terms of average dwelling time at the bus stop represented the basis for the speed profile definition when dealing with the implementation of a Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory system applied to local public transportation vehicles. In particular, four different speed profiles have been proposed leveraging topographic, vehicle performances, and timing constraints.
The availability of such a great amount of data from a bus real service allows to perform further and deeper analysis of the data collected on the road, thus representing a straightforward future development for this activity. On the other hand, the implementation and testing, both numerical and experimental, of a GLOSA system based on the proposed speed profiles would give the possibility to assess them from a quantitative point of view.</p>
