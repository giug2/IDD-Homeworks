<p id="id13.id1" class="ltx_p">The limited representation of minorities and disadvantaged populations in large-scale clinical and genomics research has
become a barrier to translating precision medicine research into practice. Due to heterogeneity across populations, risk prediction models are often found to be underperformed in these underrepresented populations, and therefore may further exacerbate known health disparities.
In this paper, we propose a two-way data integration strategy that integrates heterogeneous data from diverse populations and from multiple healthcare institutions via a federated transfer learning approach. The proposed method can handle the challenging setting where sample sizes from different populations are highly unbalanced. With only a small number of communications across participating sites, the proposed method can achieve performance comparable to the pooled analysis where individual-level data are directly pooled together. We show that the proposed method improves the estimation and prediction accuracy in underrepresented populations, and reduces the gap of model performance across populations. Our theoretical analysis reveals how estimation accuracy is influenced by communication budgets, privacy restrictions, and heterogeneity across populations. We demonstrate the feasibility and validity of our methods through numerical experiments and a real application to a multi-center study, in which we construct polygenic risk prediction models for Type II diabetes in AA population.</p>

Varmus, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite>. With the emergence of electronic health records (EHR) linked with biobank specimens, massive environmental data, and health surveys, we now have increasing opportunities to develop accurate personalized risks prediction models in a cost-effective way <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li

et al., <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>; Kraft et al., <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>. For example, a disproportionate majority (<math id="S1.SS1.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="&gt;" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.SS1.p2.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S1.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">&gt;</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.SS1.p2.1.m1.1b"><gt id="S1.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1"></gt></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.SS1.p2.1.m1.1c">&gt;</annotation></semantics></math>75%) of participants in existing genomics studies are of European descent <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Martin et al., <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. The UK biobank, one of the largest biobanks, has more than 95% of European-ancestry (EA) participants <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Sudlow
et al., <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite>. It remains challenging to optimize prediction model performance for such underrepresented populations, when there is a substantial amount of heterogeneity in underlying distributions of data across populations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(West
et al., <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>; Landry et al., <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Kraft et al., <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Duncan et al., <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. For some diseases, due to the differences in genetic architectures, linkage disequilibrium (LD) structures, and minor allele frequencies across ancestral populations, the performance of genetic risk prediction models in non-European populations has generally been found to be much poorer than in EA populations, most notably in African ancestry (AA) populations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Duncan et al., <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. To advance prediction medicine, it is crucial to improve the performance of statistical and machine learning models in underrepresented populations so as not to exacerbate health disparities.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We proposed to address the lack of representation and disparities in model performance through two data integration strategies: (1) leveraging the shared knowledge from diverse populations, and (2) integrate larger bodies of data from multiple healthcare institutions.
Data across multiple populations may share a certain amount of similarity that can be leveraged to improve the model performance in an underrepresented population <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Cai et al., <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. However, conventional methods where all data are combined and used indistinctly in training and testing, cannot tailor the prediction models to work well for specific population <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Duncan et al., <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. To account for such heterogeneity and lack of representation, we propose to use transfer learning to transfer the shared knowledge learned from diverse populations to an underrepresented population, so that comparable model performance can be reached with much less data for training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Weiss
et al., <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite>. In addition, multi-institutional data integration can improve the sample size of the underrepresented populations and the diversity of data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McCarty
et al., <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>)</cite>. We propose to use federated learning to unlock the multi-institutional EHR/biobank data, which overcomes two main barriers of institutional data integration. One is that the individual-level information can be highly sensitive which cannot be shared across institutions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(van der Haak et al., <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">2003</a>)</cite>. The other is that the often-enormous size of the EHR/biobanks data makes it infeasible or inefficient to pooling all data together due to challenges in data storage, management, and computation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kushida et al., <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>)</cite>.

<p id="S1.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Liu

They allow site-specific regression parameters that are assumed to be similar across sites in magnitude and support and perform integrative analyses based on derived summary data. However, these methods require the sample sizes for different populations to be of the same order and can perform poorly when the underlying models of some source sites are significantly different from the target sites. Different from their work, we consider a more general setting where data from multiple populations are stored in multiple sites and a more challenging setting where the sample size from each population can be highly unbalanced. We focus on the model performance of an underrepresented target population without making assumptions that model parameters across populations share the support and magnitude. Instead, our methods are robust to the cases where the underlying models for some populations differ significantly from the target population.</p>

<p id="S1.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We propose a methodology framework that incorporates heterogeneous data from diverse populations and multiple healthcare organizations to improve model fitting and prediction in an underrepresented population. Adopting transfer learning ideas, our methods tackle an important issue in precision medicine where sample sizes from different populations can be highly unbalanced. Our theoretical analysis and numerical experiments show that our methods are more accurate compared to existing methods and are robust to the level of heterogeneity. The federated learning methods we propose only require a small number of communications across participating sites, and can achieve performance comparable to the pooled analysis where individual-level data are directly pooled together.

Based on our simulation study and real data example, the size of the validation data can be relatively small compared to the training data, and cross-fitting may be used to make full use of all the data. In practice, if there are strong prior knowledge indicating that the level of heterogeneity is low across populations, the aggregation step may be skipped.</p>

For example, when constructing polygenic prediction models, the UK biobank has around 500k EA samples but only 3k AA samples. Thus, if UK biobank is selected for initialization of the EA-population, it can be done by using only the EA samples. On the contrary, if the UK biobank is selected for initialization of the AA population, a transfer learning approach is needed to improve the accuracy of initialization by incorporating both EA and AA samples.</p>

Hence, to reach comparable performance, the local Hessian algorithm requires more iterations and hence more rounds of communication. This implies that transmitting Hessian matrices not only allows heterogeneous covariates but can accelerate the convergence of federated estimators.</p>

After removing samples with unknown disease status, we obtain in total 20,247 samples from seven participating sites.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose federated transfer learning methods to improve the performance of estimation and risk prediction in underrepresented populations. Our methods allow incorporating data from diverse populations that are stored at different institutions. We provide theoretical analysis and numerical experiments to demonstrate that our methods provide more accurate estimators for the underrepresented population compared with benchmark methods. And through a limited number of iterative communications across sites, our methods can achieve similar accuracy as the pooled analysis which requires directly sharing individual-level data. We obtained promising results from a real application to eMERGE network for constructing polygenic risk prediction models for Type II diabetes in AA population, which demonstrates the feasibility of applying our methods to large clinical/genomics consortia for risk profiling and prediction in diverse populations.</p>

<p id="S6.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Our proposed methods improve the fairness of statistical models by reducing the gap of estimation accuracy across populations due to lack of representation.
Our theoretical conclusion provides insights for future data collection, as it reveals how the level of heterogeneity impacts the accuracy gain, and the sample size from the target population needed to achieve comparable accuracy as the source populations. This is different from methods that impose constraints on model fitting to ensure that the prediction accuracy of an algorithm has to be at the same level across different populations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Mehrabi et al., <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. Since we are focusing on improving the performance of models in an underrepresented population, our work cannot guarantee complete fairness in prediction accuracy across all groups. In the future, we can incorporate fairness corrections and constraints into our framework, and in the meantime consider a wide variety of models in longitudinal and survival analysis, causal inference, to advance algorithmic fairness in precision medicine.</p>
