<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Training a machine learning model with federated edge learning (FEEL) is typically time-consuming due to the constrained computation power of edge devices and limited wireless resources in edge networks.
In this paper, the training time minimization problem is investigated in a quantized FEEL system, where the heterogeneous edge devices send quantized gradients to the edge server via orthogonal channels.
In particular, a stochastic quantization scheme is adopted for compression of uploaded gradients, which can reduce the burden of per-round communication but may come at the cost of increasing number of communication rounds.
The training time is modeled by taking into account the communication time, computation time and the number of communication rounds.
Based on the proposed training time model, the intrinsic trade-off between the number of communication rounds and per-round latency is characterized.
Specifically, we analyze the convergence behavior of the quantized FEEL in terms of the optimality gap.
Further, a joint data-and-model-driven fitting method is proposed to obtain the exact optimality gap, based on which the closed-form expressions for the number of communication rounds and the total training time are obtained.
Constrained by total bandwidth, the training time minimization problem is formulated as a joint quantization level and bandwidth allocation optimization problem.
To this end, an algorithm based on alternating optimization is proposed, which alternatively solves the subproblem of quantization optimization via successive convex approximation and the subproblem of bandwidth allocation via bisection search.
With different learning tasks and models, the validation of our analysis and the near-optimal performance of the proposed optimization algorithm are demonstrated by the experimental results.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The evolution of wireless networks from 1G to 5G-Advanced has witnessed a paradigm shift from connecting people targeting human-type communications towards connecting intelligence targeting machine-type communications to attain the vision of artificial intelligence of things (AIoT). This has driven the rapid development of an emerging area called <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">edge intelligence</span>, sitting at the intersection of the two disciplines, namely artificial intelligence (AI) and wireless communications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
In edge intelligence, AI technologies are pushed towards the network edge so that the edge servers can quickly access real-time data generated by edge devices for fast training and real-time inference <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
A promising framework for distributed edge learning, called <span id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">federated edge learning</span> (FEEL), has recently been pushed into the spotlight, which distributes the task of model training to edge devices and keeps the data locally at the edge devices so as to avoid data uploading and thus preserve user-privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
Specifically, a typical training process of FEEL involves multiple rounds of wireless communication between the edge server and devices. In a particular round, the edge server firstly broadcasts the global model under training to the edge devices for local <span id="S1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">stochastic gradient decent</span> (SGD) execution using local data, and then the edge devices upload their local models/gradients to the edge server for aggregation and global model updating.
After the convergence criterion is met, such as attaining a desired level of accuracy or reaching a pre-defined value of the loss, the entire training process will be completed, and then on-device models can be tweaked for the edge device’s personalization.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In edge networks, the computation resource of the edge devices are constrained, and the wireless resource of the network, e.g., frequency bandwidth, is also limited, so training a AI model by FEEL is usually a time-consuming and expensive task that can take anywhere from hours to weeks to complete <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Hence, training time<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>This is also called wall-clock time in some literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. In this work, we use “total training time”, “training time”, and “wall-clock time” interchangeably.</span></span></span> minimization of AI models is one of the critical concerns in FEEL. The whole training process of FEEL typically consists of multiple communication rounds, and each lasts for a period of time consisting of computation time and communication time, which we called <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">per-round latency</span>. To reduce the total training time, we should not only bring down the number of communication rounds, i.e., speed up the convergence rate of the learning algorithm, but also shorten the per-round latency.
Communication-efficient transmission achieved through compression is usually included into the FEEL pipeline to alleviate the transmission burden of the edge devices, and thus reduce the per-round latency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
Two main lossy compression techniques, namely quantization and sparsification, as well as combination of them, have been considered in the literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.
Specifically, in the case of quantization, the gradient vector entries are transmitted after being quantized to finite bits, instead of the full floating-point values <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>; sparsification reduces the communication overhead by only sending significant entries of the gradient vector <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.
Although the compressed transmission can decrease the per-round latency, the lossy compression will degrade the convergence speed of FEEL as well, which leads to the increase in the number of communication rounds to achieve a certain accuracy on a given task <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
As a result, the compression level balances the <span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">trade-off between the number of communication rounds and per-round latency</span> in minimization of the total training time in FEEL.
Besides, the edge devices in the edge network are usually heterogeneous such that some of edge devices with lower computation power become laggards in the synchronous model/gradient aggregation due to their longer computation time, which increases the per-round latency.
It is necessary to consider the optimization of wireless resources over different edge devices to reduce the communication time of the lagging edge devices, and compensate the longer computation time <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
With the goal of minimizing the total training time, we study the following question: How to balance the trade-off between the number of communication rounds and per-round latency via joint quantization level and bandwidth allocation optimization in the presence of device heterogeneity.</p>

These efforts have focused on speeding up the convergence of FEEL algorithms, i.e., reducing the number of communication rounds, without considering minimizing the total training time, which is a more practical and important issue in FEEL.</p>

Thus, we make a comprehensive analysis on the total training time by taking into account the communication time, computation time and the number of communication rounds, based on which the intrinsic trade-off between the number of communication rounds and per-round latency is characterized.

To tackle the challenge, we analyze the convergence behavior of quantized FEEL in terms of the optimality gap and establish the expression of the minimum number of communication rounds that achieves a given optimality gap of the loss function. However, the derived results are generally too loose to be used for further optimization. In order to yield an accurate estimate on the required number of communication rounds, we propose a joint data-and-model-driven fitting method to further refine and tighten the derived result.

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we provide numerical results of two experiments under different wireless communication scenarios and learning tasks, which capture real system heterogeneity, to examine our theoretical results. In Experiment I, we consider a learning task with strongly convex loss function and training model of small size. In Experiment II, to stretch the theory, we consider a learning task with non-convex loss function and training model of large size. Although our analysis is developed based on the assumption of strongly convex loss function, we show that the proposed algorithm can also work well in the case with non-convex loss function. All experiments are implemented by PyTorch using Python 3.8 on a Linux server with one NVIDIA<sup id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_sup">®</sup> GeForce<sup id="S5.p1.1.2" class="ltx_sup">®</sup> RTX 3090 GPU 24GB and one Intel<sup id="S5.p1.1.3" class="ltx_sup">®</sup> Xeon<sup id="S5.p1.1.4" class="ltx_sup">®</sup> Gold 5218 CPU.</p>

We can observe that the scheme with optimal bandwidth allocation can reach the predefined threshold and obtain a higher test accuracy in a shorter time.

To show how the heterogeneous computation power of edge devices affect the communication resource allocation, we present the CPU frequency of each edge device and its corresponding optimal allocated bandwidth in Fig. <a href="#S5.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ V-B3 Optimization of bandwidth ‣ V-B Experiment results in Experiment I ‣ V Experimental evaluation ‣ Training Time Minimization for Federated Edge Learning with Optimized Gradient Quantization and Bandwidth Allocation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>.

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper have studied the training time minimization for quantized FEEL with optimized quantization level and bandwidth allocation.
On the basis of the convergence analysis of quantized FEEL and our proposed joint-data-and-model-driven fitting method, we derived the closed-form expression of the total training time and characterizes the trade-off between the convergence speed and communication overhead, which is governed by the quantization level.
Next, we minimized the total training time by optimizing the quantization level and bandwidth allocation, for which a high-quality near-optimal solutions are obtained by alternating optimization.
The theoretical results developed can be used to guide the system optimization and contribute to the understanding of how wireless communication system can properly coordinate resources to accomplish learning tasks.
This also opens several directions for further research. One direction is to implement device sampling in quantized FEEL, in which how the bandwidth is allocated to minimize the training time is completely a different story. The other direction is to consider error compensation in quantized FEEL to mitigate the effects of compression errors.</p>
