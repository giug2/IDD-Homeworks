<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">With the deployment of smart sensors and advancements in communication technologies, big data analytics have become vastly popular in the smart grid domain, informing stakeholders of the best power utilization strategy. However, these power-related data are stored and owned by different parties. For example, power consumption data are stored in numerous transformer stations across cities; mobility data of the population, which are important indicators of power consumption, are held by mobile companies. Direct data sharing might compromise party benefits, individual privacy and even national security. Inspired by the federated learning scheme from Google AI, we propose a federated learning framework for smart grids, which enables collaborative learning of power consumption patterns without leaking individual power traces. Horizontal federated learning is employed when data are scattered in the sample space; vertical federated learning, on the other hand, is designed for the case with data scattered in the feature space. Case studies show that, with proper encryption schemes such as Paillier encryption, the machine learning models constructed from the proposed framework are lossless, privacy-preserving and effective. Finally, the promising future of federated learning in other facets of the smart grid is discussed, including electric vehicles, distributed generation/consumption and integrated energy systems.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The 21st century has witnessed an increasingly digitalized and intelligent power grid. The widely distributed sensors, featuring smart meters and global positioning systems, are continuously sending back power-related data from all facets of the grid. Advances in information and communication technologies (ICT) such as 5G have also ensured the timely transmission of these high-resolution data streams back to stakeholders. Big data analytics, attributable to the emergence of such massive data streams, are becoming vastly popular within the past decades. They aim at constructing data-driven models of the physical grid, which help stakeholders establish an informed decision that maximizes their benefits. For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> recently constructed a comprehensive model of the U.S. power grid, based on the open-source smart grid profiles collected across the Internet, to investigate carbon emissions by 2030. State-of-the-art machine learning models, including deep learning, reinforcement learning and generative networks, are also intensively explored to forecast load and renewable profiles <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, address grid disturbances <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> and defend against false injection attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">One key feature inherent in the big data analytics of smart grids is the natural separation of data by different data-holding parties. This separation in the data space can either be (1) horizontal, where each party holds different training samples but has access to the same set of features, or (2) vertical, where each party shares the same set of training samples but holds different features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Either way, if all the separated data are aggregated into the central server for analysis, the communicational and computational burden would be enormous. The emergence of various distributed learning techniques can mitigate such problems through multi-party collaborated learning, which includes smart task allocation, parallel computing and data sharing mechanisms<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. However, most distributed learning frameworks require parties to share their data and models in a direct and unprotected manner (as discussed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>), which leads to the privacy of data being compromised. In a world where data privacy is greatly valued and even legislated (e.g., the General Data Protection Regulation Act in the European Union <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>), it is urgent that all data be secured in the learning process, to minimize data leakage into the hands of eavesdroppers or other parties.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In 2016, Google AI proposed federated learning as a new form of distributed learning, with intentions of learning user behavior across mobile devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. It echoed the distributed learning scheme in terms of parallel and collaborative data processing, but differed in that only <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">encrypted</em> model updates were transferred in each training epoch, while the entire training data remained inside the devices themselves. Both the encryption mechanism and the immobility of user data protected privacy. In the years that follow, various improvements to federated learning emerged, with stronger concerns on addressing the heterogeneity of training data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, computational power <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> and communicational networks across devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Yang et al. further extended the concept of federated learning from addressing horizontally-separated to vertically-separated data, and proposed Secure-Boost <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, a privacy-preserving version of XGBoost <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, for nonlinear vertical federated learning. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ A Federated Learning Framework for Smart Grids: Securing Power Traces in Collaborative Learning" class="ltx_ref">Fig. 1</a> shows the development of federated learning since the concept was coined. Besides the increasing number of publications by year <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, federated learning has also penetrated into multiple research fields, including smart mobile devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> and Internet of Things <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Two open-source learning frameworks, TensorFlow Federated <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> and FATE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, were also developed and released in the past 3 years.</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Surprisingly, federated learning has rarely been explored in the smart grid domain. The works in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> are among the few implementations of federated learning in electric load forecast and EV-based energy demand prediction, but they merely address the horizontal separation of data, and there is a lack of systematic encryption scheme. The importance of data privacy in the smart grid should be self-evident and significant, as leakage of power traces will lead to grid vulnerabilities being exposed and targeted, affecting the local economy and even national security. Therefore, we hereby propose a federated learning framework for smart grids, to maximally secure power traces in multi-party collaborated learning. The framework is intended to address both vertical and horizontal separations of power traces, and various machine learning models are directly applicable as the built-in learning tool. The framework is demonstrated within a real-life problem setup, where the Zhuhai Power Grid (China) intends to better learn the patterns of power consumption, but the power traces are scattered across inner-city transformer stations, and population mobility data of Zhuhai citizens (which are important indicators of power consumption) are held by commercial mobile companies. Our contributions to the field of smart grid can be summarized as:</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Within the smart grid domain, there are two most commonly observed types of data separation. The first type is known as horizontal data separation, where all parties hold different training samples, but these samples share the same set of features and labels (<a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ II Problem Setup ‣ A Federated Learning Framework for Smart Grids: Securing Power Traces in Collaborative Learning" class="ltx_ref">Fig. 2(a)</a>). For example, household-level and district-level power consumption data are recorded by numerous sensor networks and transformer stations distributed across cities. Under this construct, all parties are considered homogeneous as they hold similar information of each sample. They can choose to train models separately, but a collaborative training scheme would greatly enrich the training set, contributing to a high generalization performance of the resulting models. The collaboration is easier to achieve since these parties, typically operated by the same power company, have little curious or malicious intentions over each other. Nevertheless, raw data are still preferred not to be transferred directly, as eavesdroppers might easily intercept these information.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, data might be separated in a way that the parties hold different features over the same set of samples (<a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ II Problem Setup ‣ A Federated Learning Framework for Smart Grids: Securing Power Traces in Collaborative Learning" class="ltx_ref">Fig. 2(b)</a>). This is known as vertical data separation. For example, besides power consumption data, there might also be demographics or weather data that are highly related to power, but held by external parties whose benefits would compromised if data are exchanged. Under this construct, all parties are considered heterogeneous as they hold different feature sets, and collaborative training would be preferred with complementary features as additional inputs. Raw datasets are naturally forbidden to be transferred across parties; even the intermediate model parameters need to be effectively encrypted before transferral.</p>

<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">It can be seen that for both types of data separation, it is necessary to construct a secure and reliable framework for multiple parties to train a model collaboratively.

<p id="S2.p12.18" class="ltx_p">Besides power consumption, there is another dataset provided by China Mobile delineating the hourly mobility information of the Zhuhai population. To mitigate ethical concerns, all personal information was erased and instead converted to district-level statistics as features (age group, headcount, etc.) before the dataset was available to us. The mobility dataset can also be temporally aligned with the power consumption dataset with distinct features, which provides a natural example of vertically separated data (<span id="S2.p12.18.1" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_bold">Case 2</span>).

However, the strong restraint on raw data exchange poses significant challenges to this training convention. HFL suggests that an alternative learning framework, through distributed local training and <em id="S3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">secure</em> client-server synchronization, is mathematically equivalent to training the combined dataset in a centralized manner. During this process, the raw datasets remain locally stored, and all the synchronized information is safely immune to eavesdroppers.</p>

It can be seen that the HFL framework converges perfectly within 10 epochs with an average MSE of 0.04, and no overfitting is observed. Instead, if each party individually trains its own data, then despite a similarly impressive performance on the training set itself, the as-trained model generalizes poorly to the data of other parties, with a significant level of overfitting on the test set.</p>

If in any epoch a party is not able to upload a parameter update in time, the aggregated server discards its updates and instead averages all other parties’ updates. Case study shows that when the update failure rate of each party is set to 40%, this communication delay would result in the MSE error dropping more slowly, but convergence is still reachable within 10 epochs. A slightly higher final MSE level of 0.051 is reached compared the delay-free HFL, but even so the error is still much lower than that of separate training on a single district.</p>

determines how data are further categorized at each node. Instead of searching the sample space individually for a greedy separation, XGBoost pre-divides training data into bins for each feature, and decides which edge of bins yields the maximum information gain.

Furthermore, the majority of MSE drop takes place right after training the first tree, by which time the MSE loss is already smaller than that of the final VFLR model. This indicates that we only need to train the first tree if computational efficiency is required. Finally similar to VFLR, if China Mobile feels its data might be compromised and withdrew from the collaboration, then the MSE loss will converge to a much higher 0.28.</p>

If the feature index belongs to Power Supply Bureau already, it then looks up the threshold value to decide which child node the test sample belongs to. If instead the feature index falls onto China Mobile, then Power Supply Bureau would request China Mobile to check out the test sample and inform whether it should belong to the left or right child node. Finally the test sample would reach onto a leaf node, which contains the prediction value of this sample on this particular tree.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed a systematic federated learning framework, that addresses both the horizontal and vertical separation of data in a distributed fashion. To protect user privacy and secure power traces, raw data are always stored locally to prevent data leakage, while the model parameters and sample statistics are Paillier-encrypted before the exchange. Two case studies centered around the real-life problem setup confirms the effectiveness of the proposed federated learning sub-frameworks, whose lossless property is also validated through analysis.</p>
