<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is an approach to train machine learning models on the edge
of the networks, as close as possible where the data is produced, motivated by
the emerging problem of the inability to stream and centrally store the large
amount of data produced by edge devices as well as by data privacy concerns.
This learning paradigm is in need of robust algorithms to device
heterogeneity and data heterogeneity. This paper proposes <span id="id7.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">ModFL</span> as a
federated learning framework that splits the models into a
<span id="id7.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">configuration module</span> and an <span id="id7.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">operation module</span> enabling
federated learning of the individual modules. This modular approach makes it
possible to extract knowlege from a group of heterogeneous devices as well
as from non-IID data produced from its users. This approach can be viewed as
an extension of the federated learning with personalisation layers
<span id="id7.id1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedPer</span> framework that addresses data heterogeneity. We
show that <span id="id7.id1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">ModFL</span> outperforms <span id="id7.id1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedPer</span> for non-IID data
partitions of CIFAR-10 and STL-10 using CNNs. Our results on time-series data
with HAPT, RWHAR, and WISDM datasets using RNNs remain inconclusive, we argue
that the chosen datasets do not highlight the advantages of <span id="id7.id1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">ModFL</span>,
but in the worst case scenario it performs as well as <span id="id7.id1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedPer</span>.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The collective amount of data created in modern life mobile devices, IoT home
devices, wearables and other edge devices is practically immeasurable. Often such large
amount of data makes it unfeasible to stream, collect and store the data for
further processing. On the other hand, traditional machine learning (ML)
approaches need to centrally collect the data for model training. Additionally,
privacy concerns about data collection and government regulations, such as the
European GDPR, have set focus on federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> as an
alternative way of training ML models that cope with such restrictions. This
approach trains the ML models close to the network edges and, therefore, close to
the data sources. Only the locally trained models are centrally collected and
aggregated to a global model. The <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">De Facto</span> standard of federated
learning <span id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedAvg</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> averages the local weights from the
devices in the federation to a global model. This empirical approach has shown
to be stable even for non-convex optimisation problems and is used as
<span id="S1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">the benchmark</span> to compare to for newly developed federated learning
protocols.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Even though increasing research attention is shifting towards this field, it is
as yet at an early stage and core challenges are still to be solved.
The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> divide them into four categories; expensive communication, device
heterogeneity, data heterogeneity and privacy concerns. Our focus lies in
device and data heterogeneity. Device heterogeneity comes from the fact
that different edge devices have different hardware and thus a variability in
CPU, memory, sensors or network connectivity, leading to a variability of input
features, of local training times or communication dropouts. One factor that often is not mentioned as part
of this variability is device generation or device model, <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.</span>, edge
devices that perform the same task or measure the same observable by collecting
different types of inputs. For example, early versions of human activity
recording gadgets might only use the accelerometer for classifying the
activities, while later versions might have added a gyroscope sensor to improve
accuracy. This additional sensor is a challenge to traditional federated
learning approaches, as it needs to train from scratch a new model architecture.
In the present work we will focus on the generation difference type of device heterogeneity,
although this approach can be also used to ease the problem of different training
times due to computational power. Data heterogeneity arises as different users (edge devices) in a
federation, do in general generate data in a non-independent and non-identically
distributed (non-IID) way. In the case of human activity classification,
different persons do spend different amount of time walking, running, jogging,
jumping, lying or sitting. Some of them might never run or jump, while others
might have a regular training schedule.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Recent work addressing the data heterogeneity has proposed
federated learning with personalisation layers
(<span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedPer</span>) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. In this approach, the authors propose
to divide the neural networks (NN) into so called base layers and
personalisation layers. This approach combats effectively the ill-effects of
data heterogeneity. From <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedPer</span> we borrow
the notion of splitting the NN in two modules; <span id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">a configuration module</span>
and an <span id="S1.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">operation module</span>. We assume a scenario where different models of
edge devices have a different configuration of inputs (it can be number and/or
different kind of sensors) to perform the same task (measure the same
observable). At the same time, the edge devices are owned by different clients
that can be categorised by how they operate the edge devices. Our main
assumptions are that the configuration modules of models trained on such devices
can be trained in a federated learning way between the devices of the same kind,
whereas the operation modules can be trained between the same group of operational
clients. We call this concept modular federated learning <span id="S1.p3.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">ModFL</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this work we show that the <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">ModFL</span> framework using convolutional
neural networks (CNN) for image classification have a higher accuracy than the
<span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedPer</span> approach. We show how the proposed <span id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">ModFL</span> protocol can
benefit of federation among like-minded clients to improve accuracy even for
non-IID data. Moreover, <span id="S1.p4.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">ModFL</span> handels device generation heterogeneity
by grouping federation groups of same generation devices. For recurrent neural
networks (RNN) and time-series data, the results are not conclusive. We argue
that more challenging time-series data sets have the potential to show similar
accuracy boosts as for the CNN and image classification.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Modularity in NN was investigated by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> where the authors
showed that layered NN can be decomposed in small sets of independent neural
networks. They detected units of similar connection patterns. Recent work
from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> shows that multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) neural networks
are significantly more modular than random networks with the same distribution
of weights when trained with weight pruning. They show that this is not a
feature of the datasets it was trained on, but a general property of MLP. The current
work is motivated by these results; one question that proceeded the
development of <span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">ModFL</span> framework is how to use this modularity property
to train individual sub-modules or sets of independent NN in a federated
learning fashion.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The <span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">De Facto</span> standard of federated learning is federated averaging
(<span id="S2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedAvg</span>) first introduced in the seminal work by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
Here each device optimises the local version of the global model by stochastic
gradient descent with the same learning rate and number of local epochs. The
resulting local model updates are centrally averaged to a global model. It is
important to level the hyperparameters of <span id="S2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedAvg</span> to allow as many local
epochs as possible to reduce communication cost, on the other hand these local
epochs cannot be too long as the local models can reach local optima deviating
too much from the global optimum, making convergence slower or even making the
method diverge. A proposed framework to reduce communication and
increase the local epochs while ensuring convergence is
<span id="S2.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedProx</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, here a proximal term is added to the cost
function to be optimised during the learning period. This term helps the local
updates stay closer to the global model enabling larger local epochs and thus
minimising communication costs. Furthermore, a variable number of local
iterations across different edge devices is allowed, making it possible to
adjust this number to the device hardware capabilities.</p>

<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To address data heterogeneity in a federated learning setup,
<span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.</span>, differences in the data sources, the <span id="S2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedPer</span> framework
proposed to split the neural networks into <span id="S2.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">base layers</span> and
<span id="S2.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">personalisation layers</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. The latter ones even
after local training remain in the edge devices and are not shared, whereas the
former ones will follow collective training frameworks such as the
<span id="S2.p3.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedAvg</span>. In this way each device will have a unique model composed of
the <span id="S2.p3.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">global</span> base layers and the <span id="S2.p3.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">local</span> personalisation layers.
The assumption here is that the personalisation layers learn the specific
features of the data coming from the personal users habits, in contrast the base
layers learn more general features that are common to all users. By splitting
and training the network in such a way, the trained models perform better in
non-IID data compared to <span id="S2.p3.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedAvg</span>. In this work, the proposed framework of
<span id="S2.p3.1.9" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">ModFL</span> extends the <span id="S2.p3.1.10" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedPer</span> to also deal with device heterogeneity
of edge devices.</p>

<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Further approaches to personalised federated learning that tackle the
heterogenous data problem are <span id="S2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Per-FedAvg</span> that uses meta-learning to
train a global model that has “good” initial values such that users can
subsecuently adapt the model, within limited computational expences, to better
generalise to the user’s data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>; adaptive personalised federated
learning <span id="S2.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">APFL</span> proposes a mixture of the local and the global model,
where each client trains its local model while contributing to the global model.
The personalised model that adapts better to the user’s data emerges from the
optimization of a convex combination of the local and global
model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. These approaches tackle the data heterogeneity problem by
making use of a global model to later derive a personalised model, indirectly
assuming a common model architecture between all users, thus not taking into
account device heterogeneity. This lies in contrast to the proposed approach
here, where the model itself is split into “modules” that are federated
within their common classes, allowing to have different model architecture and
size per client by combining different “modules”. A recent approach that uses
clustering between similar users is <span id="S2.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">PerFed-CKT</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Here the
authors propose clustered co-distillation where clients transfer their knowlege
to other clients that have similar data-distribution. Because in this setup
logits are shared instead of model parameters clients with different model
architectures and sizes can federate between each other, thus tackling the device
and data heterogeneity problem. This approach uses a common dataset that is
shared between all clients, the clustering is based on the similarity of the
models output of the common dataset. Similar to the present work,
<span id="S2.p4.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">PerFed-CKT</span> tackles the device and data heterogeneity problem, but differs
in that <span id="S2.p4.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">PerFed-CKT</span> does need a common (public) data set shared between
all clients, whereas <span id="S2.p4.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">ModFL</span> does not need such a public dataset. Another
difference is the global model aggregation, <span id="S2.p4.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">ModFL</span> averages over the
model parameters, wheras <span id="S2.p4.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">PerFed-CKT</span> does averages over the logits of
the clients models output based on the public dataset.</p>

between each other. However, in general in a federated learning setup, the clients
generate non-IID data. To deal with this, the authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> introduced the
personalisation layers, which would be local to every client and would not
federate. In <span id="S3.p1.15.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">ModFL</span>, we assume that client operations
can be categorised, whether from a priori knowledge of the edge device usage
(operation) or by a similarity measure such as the one proposed by
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. To simplify the setup, we assume that a priori
knowledge of the clients is available. <span id="S3.p1.15.9" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">ModFL</span> then proposes to federate the operation modules
between clients belonging to the same operation category cohort. This way the configuration modules of
<span id="S3.p1.15.10" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">ModFL</span> deal with device heterogeneity while the operation modules deal with data heterogeneity.</p>

<p id="S3.p2.10" class="ltx_p">The main idea of <span id="S3.p2.10.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">ModFL</span> is to federate the different configuration and
operation modules of the deep neural network with its corresponding peers. This
means that the configuration module will not necessary federate with the same
peers as the operation module. To illustrate it with an example, we
assume that we have four clients, each of them will train a local model

(RWHAR) are three different human activity recognition datasets, in which they
have 5 labels in common. Each data sample has a unique label. WISDM collects
accelerometer time-series data from smartphones with a frequency of 20 Hz,
while HAPT and RWHAR collect accelerometer and gyroscope time-series data with
a 50 Hz frequency. Although RWHAR has sensors in different locations (head, chest, arm, waist and more), only the one from the waist was
used as that is similar to WISDM. Due to the difference in the number of data
samples for each label and dataset, we evened the amount of data to 1250 data samples
per dataset with a 80/20 train and test ratio.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For the image classification, we use CNN layers
followed by fully connected layers. Since CIFAR-10 and STL-10 have different
resolution images, we designed the configuration module layers differently while
the operation module layers remain the same. For the CIFAR model, we designed
the configuration module with 32–64–128 units of 2D convolutional layers with
average pooling in between followed by a 256 units fully connected layer, in
total 4 layers. The configuration module for STL model is designed with
16–32–64–128 units of 2D convolutional layers with max pooling in between
followed by a 256 units fully connected layer, in total 5 layers. The
operation module for both models are 128–64–9 units of fully connected layers.

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS0.Px2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Since the human activity classification
datasets are time-series data, the natural way for classification is to use RNN,
for this case we used long-short term memory (LSTM), with fully connected layers. For the
HAPT model, we designed the configuration module with a 16 units LSTM layer
followed by a 16 units fully connected layer. For the RWHAR model, we used a
24 units LSTM layer with 32–16 units of fully connected layers. Lastly, for the
WISDM model we had an 8 units LSTM layer with a 16 units fully connected layer.
The operation module consisted of 16–5 units of
fully connected layers. See Fig. <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ Image classification ‣ IV-B Model Architectures and Hyperparameters ‣ IV Experimental Setup ‣ Modular Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> for an illustration of

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS0.Px2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For the federated learning training to converge easier, the weight
initialisation should be the same for all clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. In our
case, the configuration module layers from the same model have to be initiated
with the same weights and the operation module layers for all clients have to be
initiated with the same weights. Similarly to the conclusions
from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> where different models have slightly better test
accuracy with different amount of personalised layers, we conclude that the cut
between the configuration module and the operation module of a model is an
additional hyperparameter to be tuned for each specific case.</p>

<span id="S5.SS2.p2.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedPer</span> for non-IID data and <span id="S5.SS2.p2.2.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedAvg</span> for IID data. Moreover, we

<span id="S5.SS2.p2.2.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedPer</span> is due to the nature of the dataset; the accuracy of the models

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we propose <span id="S6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">ModFL</span> a novel framework to train neural
networks in a federated learning fashion when non-IID data is generated and
the edge devices are heterogeneous, <span id="S6.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.</span>, they belong to different
generations and thus have different kind of data but perform the same task. We
achieve this by extending the <span id="S6.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedPer</span> approach of splitting the neural
networks into configuration modules (layers) and operation modules (layers) and
let the configuration modules federate between same kind of devices while
like-minded users are allowed to federate the operation modules. Results on
CIFAR-10 and STL-10 data indicate that the <span id="S6.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">ModFL</span> protocol for CNN is well
suited to take full advantage of the a federated learning approach among
different groups of peers and show that it outperforms <span id="S6.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedPer</span>. It
serves as an alternative to <span id="S6.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedPer</span> when the individual clients do not
have sufficient data to train the personalisation layers. The results on the
time-series data using RNN are inconclusive and further research on more
challenging datasets is needed. Further work on more challenging time-series
data is desired to understand better the advantages and limitations of the
proposed framework in this kind of data.</p>
