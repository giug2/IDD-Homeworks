<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">Synthetic data is emerging as a promising new way to harness the value of data, while reducing privacy risks. The potential of synthetic data is not limited to privacy-friendly data release, but it also includes complementing real data in use-cases such as training machine learning algorithms that are more fair and robust to distribution shifts etc. There is a lot of interest in algorithmic advances in synthetic data generation for providing better privacy and statistical guarantees and for its better utilisation in machine learning pipelines. However, for responsible and trustworthy synthetic data generation, it is not sufficient to focus only on these algorithmic aspects and instead, a holistic view of the synthetic data generation pipeline must be considered.</p>
<p id="id5.id2" class="ltx_p">We build a novel system that allows the contributors of real data to autonomously participate in differentially private synthetic data generation without relying on a trusted centre. Our modular, general and scalable solution is based on three building blocks namely: Solid (Social Linked Data), MPC (Secure Multi-Party Computation) and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). Solid is a specification that lets people store their data securely in decentralised data stores called Pods and control access to their data. MPC refers to the set of cryptographic methods for different parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private. TEEs such as Intel SGX rely on hardware based features for confidentiality and integrity of code and data. We show how these three technologies can be effectively used to address various challenges in responsible and trustworthy synthetic data generation by ensuring: 1) contributor autonomy, 2) decentralisation, 3) privacy and 4) scalability. We support our claims with rigorous empirical results on simulated and real datasets and different synthetic data generation algorithms.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In today’s data-driven world, the need for large and diverse datasets is greater than ever. These datasets are instrumental in training machine learning models, conducting research, and fuelling innovation across various domains, from healthcare to finance and beyond. However, the acquisition and sharing of real-world data in a responsible way have become increasingly challenging due to concerns about privacy, security, and the potential misuse of sensitive information.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In response to these challenges, the field of synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising solution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Synthetic data refers to artificially generated data that mimics the statistical properties of real-world data while minimizing privacy risks. It offers a means to balance the need for data-driven insights and open availability with the imperative of protecting individual privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Beyond privacy, synthetic data approaches are also being actively explored to overcome the limitations and shortcomings of real data for building more robust artificial intelligence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">There exists a rich body of research dedicated to the algorithmic intricacies of synthetic data generation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. These studies have delved into the development of novel techniques for generating synthetic data with properties closely mirroring those of real-world data, addressing challenges such as preserving statistical distributions, correlations, and structural features while guaranteeing individual privacy. However, while these algorithmic aspects are crucial, there has been a notable gap in research when it comes to considering the broader synthetic data generation pipeline.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">For synthetic data to be truly responsible, trustworthy, and privacy-preserving, it is imperative to embrace a holistic perspective. This encompasses not only the algorithms used for data synthesis but also the entire lifecycle of data, starting with the contributors of the real data. We put forward the principle of contributor autonomy as one of the central tenets of responsible synthetic data generation. Contributors, who provide the real data, should have a significant degree of control and decision-making power throughout the synthetic data generation process. This autonomy ensures that their interests and concerns are taken into account, ultimately promoting trust and ethical data handling practices.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Further, a common assumption in most synthetic data generation approaches is the existence of a central curator. There are several problems with this approach. It expects diverse set of contributors to trust a common party to manage their (real) data, which may not be a practical and inclusive assumption. The lack of trust can lead to reduced or dishonest contributions, in turn lowering the quality of data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. The dependency on intermediaries can also introduce vulnerabilities and privacy risks. It can lead to a lack of transparency and accountability in the data generation pipeline.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Our research seeks to shift the paradigm by advocating for decentralised and <em id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">contributor-centric</em> synthetic data generation approaches. We develop a system that runs differentially private synthetic data generation algorithms in a decentralised and private manner, while the contributors of the original data retain control of their data and their decision to participate in a given synthetic data generation process. The proposed approach requires no alteration in the synthetic data generation algorithm and therefore, provides the same level of accuracy and differential-privacy guarantees as the approaches that assume trusted center (unlike, for e.g., local differential privacy approaches that have worse accuracy-privacy trade-off).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">At the heart of our proposal lies Solid (derived from <span id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">social linked data</span>), a specification pioneered by Sir Tim Berners-Lee <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Solid lets people store their data securely in decentralised data stores called Pods and lets them control access to their data. Unlike current centralised web and data architectures, where different applications and organisations collect and keep user data locked away, Solid decouples data from applications. A variety of user data can be stored in Solid pods. Different applications can read and write data to the user pod and provide services using the data, under user specified preferences. This is useful from a privacy perspective but more importantly, people get control over their data (further discussion on Solid in Section <a href="#S3.SS2" title="III-B Solid ‣ III Background ‣ Decentralised, Scalable and Privacy-Preserving Synthetic Data Generation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-B</span></span></a>). Individuals may also be willing to contribute the data in their Pods to generate synthetic data for a variety of causes. However, for synthetic data generation, computations have to be performed over the data of multiple people. This is challenging without requiring a trusted center. The challenge is further complicated by the fact that Solid Pods lack any local computation capability. Recent research proposed a modular architecture for integrating Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) with Solid, enabling arbitrary computations to be performed in a decentralised manner over data stored in Solid Pods. We build upon this recent research and show how differentially-private synthetic data can be generated in a scalable manner without compromising the autonomy and privacy of contributors. Instead of <em id="S1.p7.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">only</em> relying on MPC, we offer a more scalable alternative that uses both MPC and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). We show how to implement different steps of synthetic data generation algorithms in MPC and TEEs, utilising MPC where it offers the most value and using TEEs elsewhere to overcome MPC’s performance challenges. Our pioneering system for scalable, decentralised and privacy-preserving synthetic data generation is a novel contribution to the broader literature on holistic, human-centric research on trustworthy artificial intelligence, and we believe that the paper will be a useful resource for practitioners and academic researchers in this space. We analyse the scalability and privacy related strengths and limitations of the approach.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A synthetic dataset is a substitute for an original dataset that has the same format and reflects the statistical properties of the original dataset, without reproducing the records in the original. In our settings, different individuals hold their own data records in a decentralised manner. We are interested in generating synthetic data that mimics the properties of a dataset containing records of all individuals who are willing to participate in the synthetic data generation process, without requiring a trusted centre and ensuring that individuals have full autonomy and privacy. During the synthetic data generation process, the original data records should be kept confidential with the respective individuals and not revealed to others. This is also referred to as input privacy. From the synthetic data, an adversary should not be able to make undesired inferences about the original data records or the individuals. This is also referred to as output privacy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we consider synthetic data generation algorithms that provide differential-privacy guarantees <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> for output privacy. However, the algorithms to generate differentially-private synthetic data, by themselves, provide neither decentralisation nor input privacy. We therefore need additional mechanisms. For decentralisation, we need decentralised storage, access control and reduced dependence on a trusted center for the computation steps involved in the synthetic data generation algorithms.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Zhao et al <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> proposed a novel architecture, Libertas, to integrate Personal Data Stores with Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC). Personal Data Stores provide individuals decentralised storage and access control for their data records. Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) provides input privacy and allows individuals to participate in arbitrary computations over their data records collectively without relying on a trusted center. Decentralised synthetic data generation with input and output privacy is thus one example of a use-case that can be realised using Libertas.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In response to increasing centralisation of data and loss of user autonomy, several decentralised data architectures have been proposed that aim to give users more control over their personal data. One such approach that has gained considerable traction is Personal Data Stores (PDS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Under this decentralised data paradigm, users store their data in a Pod (Personal Online Datastore). A Pod provides granular control to users over who can access which data as well as secure transmission of data for authorised requests. The apps and services that they use (for e.g. various web based applications, online social platforms, health service applications etc), also read and write data to the user’s Pod. Users can transfer their data from one Pod service provider to another, including the option to self host. This unlocks a whole new paradigm for app design based on interoperability, a key design aspect (Linked Data) of Solid. The decoupling of data and apps reduces the need for expensive data collection across platforms, thereby benefiting developers as well. Pods support both structured and unstructured data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">There are several PDS projects ranging from purely academic implementations to those with commercial offerings, among them openPDS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, Databox <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, and Solid <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. These vary in their protocol design and the demands they place on the features a Pod must support.

An example of what a WebID might appear as is <code id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">https://eg.pod.provider/profile/card#me</code>. To share data with someone else, the user who controls the Pod must associate sharing preferences of that resource with the WebID of the party with which they wish to share their data with. The WebID is provided by an Identity Provider and provides the authentication function. Most providers use the OpenID Connect protocol (OIDC) to prove ownership of a WebID. Authorisation is handled by the Web Access Control (WAC) system based on an Access Control List model for decentralised use cases <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.
Anyone or anything that accesses data in a Solid Pod uses a unique ID, authenticated by a decentralised extension of OpenID Connect. Solid’s access control system (WAC) uses these IDs to determine whether a person or application has access to a resource in a Pod.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the past few decades, there has been significant research on the development of efficient MPC protocols. The cryptographic primitives that are typically used to implement MPC are secret sharing schemes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, garbled circuits <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, and oblivious transfer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. We focus on secret sharing which is the consideration of subsection <a href="#S3.SS3.SSS2" title="III-C2 Shamir Secret Sharing ‣ III-C Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) ‣ III Background ‣ Decentralised, Scalable and Privacy-Preserving Synthetic Data Generation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-C</span>2</span></a>. MPC protocols differ in their security assumptions regarding the adversary, which is the subject of the following discussion.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A party is said to be corrupted if it is under the control of an adversary who wishes to learn the private input of a participant. Corrupted parties may collude at any stage of the MPC computation. The two main parameters that define the power of the adversary are: <em id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">adversarial behaviour</em> and <em id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">number of corrupted parties</em>. There are three main types of adversarial behaviours considered in the literature: 1) semi-honest or passive adversaries, 2) malicious or active adversaries, and 3) covert adversaries. The adversaries differ in whether and how they deviate from the protocol. Broadly, the number of corrupted parties is categorised as honest majority and dishonest majority.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.SSSx4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Libertas addresses three main limitations of Solid. First, a user can allow an agent, that has not been granted access to some data directly, to utilise the data as input in a multiparty computation procedure, without compromising the user privacy.
Second, it overcomes the limitations arising due to the lack of computation capability in Solid Pods, by a mechanism to delegate participation in the joint computation while users retain control. Third, under a direct-decentralised model where data providers are also the protocol players, MPC scales poorly as the number of players grow. Conversely, the delegated-decentralised model used in Libertas, with a smaller number of agents acting as players, offers significantly better scalability. But fundamentally, costs due to MPC protocols remain challenging to overcome.</p>

<p id="S3.SS6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Any dataset release (including synthetic data) that meaningfully preserves statistics of the original dataset will result in a privacy loss. Thus, there exists a privacy-utility trade-off. As mentioned earlier, we are interested in synthetic data generation algorithms with differential-privacy guarantees for output privacy. There exists several algorithms for differentially-private synthetic data generation. In this paper, we focus on marginal-based approaches to synthetic data generation that have achieved considerable success in practice. Marginal-based algorithms won the 2018 NIST Differential Privacy Synthetic Data Competition, for instance, and performed competitively in other iterations of the contest <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We have proposed that separating the preliminary, aggregating histogram step (in MPC) from the subsequent steps could improve the scalability of privacy friendly synthetic data generation in decentralised contexts. For example, depending on the algorithm, these subsequent steps may involve adding noise to the histograms using the appropriate mechanism based on the designated privacy budget to ensure the measurements are differentially-private and then run a generation algorithm such as PGM on the measurements that can be released to the MPC app user. Similarly, in the case of MWEM algorithm, this involves running the iterative algorithm where measure and generate steps are more interweaved. Note that we do not modify the steps of the algorithm or propose a new algorithm. The aggregate histograms that are needed as input in the synthetic data generation algorithm are computed from the individual data points using MPC. This aggregated histogram is then used by the algorithm but the algorithm itself is not implemented in MPC (unlike <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>). We therefore inherit the differential-privacy privacy guarantees from the respective algorithm for the final output but let us now address an intermediate vulnerability that is introduced as a result of this separation from MPC and how we alleviate it.</p>

We delegate the subsequent tasks to a randomly chosen computation party instead, i.e. only the chosen party receives the aggregated histogram output. The random selection is part of the MPC circuit as a joint random number generation procedure and hence adherence is enforced by the MPC protocol used (and with the underlying security parameters discussed in Section <a href="#S3.SS3" title="III-C Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) ‣ III Background ‣ Decentralised, Scalable and Privacy-Preserving Synthetic Data Generation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-C</span></span></a>).</p>

After the MPC has concluded, the output (aggregated non-private histogram) is sent to the enclave via a secure channel for executing rest of the steps of differentially-private synthetic data generation process. Typically an extension of SSL/TLS which forces the enclave endpoint to incorporate its attestation proof with its certificate serves as the channel <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S5.SS1.SSSx2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.SSSx2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Gramine is a library OS that is used to run unmodified Linux applications (e.g. the Python interpreter) in an SGX enclave <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>. While the Intel SGX SDK exposes a low-level C/C++ interface for writing enclave applications, we use Gramine for portability and faster development cycles. Gramine works much like a unikernel by exposing a set of system call implementations as a user space library, serving as a compatibility layer. We provide a manifest file with the associated source code to configure the application environment and isolation policies.</p>

<div id="S5.SS1.SSSx3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.SSSx3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The Marginal-Based Inference (MBI) library exposes procedures that take as input noisy measurements (e.g. differentially private marginals) and generates synthetic data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>. While selection of the right queries is an important question <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>, we restrict attention to the scalability and MBI provides a generic interface with a range of implemented algorithms for comparison.

<p id="S5.SS2.SSSx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our computational and encryption agents were deployed on a single server connected over a virtual LAN. This was to focus on the computational cost of the approaches while controlling for network factors such as latency and bandwidth that would affect the scalability. We acknowledge that these are important as the agents may be connected over a WAN, hence we report the size of data transfers in each computation.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.SSSx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We deploy 3 computation agent servers and 2 encryption agent servers, unless stated otherwise. This is because for honest majority protocols, 3 is the minimum number of players. Furthermore, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> shows that in a delegated-decentralised setting, MPCs with fewer players scale better. Hence, any improvement our approach offers in this setting should also translate to cases with greater number of players.</p>

<div id="S5.SS2.SSSx3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.SSSx3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For evaluating the proposed approach, we simulate different settings in which data providers have data records stored in their Solid pods. For the first part of our experiments, we use 1-dimensional simulated data records. Please note the distinction between ‘simulated data’ and ‘synthetic data’. In our paper, synthetic data is the data produced by a differentially-private generation algorithm that takes real data from data providers as input. In the first part of our experiments, we simulate this real data using ‘simulated data’, which would be the input of synthetic data generation algorithm. The data was uniformly sampled from a range of 0 to 20. There are two scenarios that we consider here. The first is the fixed total data setting where we fix the total number of data records at 10000 and evenly distribute it among the data providers. The second is the variable total data setting where we fix the number of data records per data provider at 100. This latter situation gives us between 1000 and 100000 data records (the number of data providers range from 10 to 1000).</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.SSSx3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For the second part of experiments, where the performance of marginal-based generation algorithms under our approach is benchmarked, we use real-world datasets that are common benchmarks in the synthetic data generation literature. In particular, we rely on the Adult <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite> and the Titanic <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> datasets. There are a few preprocessing steps that we undertake before storing the data records in Solid Pods. Since many generation algorithms including MWEM assume discrete-valued data, we remove certain continuous values attributes and discretise others. We further remove data records with missing values.</p>

The reported time includes the time in communication setup. We observe that running MWEM with our approach takes less than 500 seconds, while MWEM with MPC only takes almost 3000 seconds even for just 10 data providers. While the computation time in both settings grows linearly with data providers, the faster growth in the MPC+TEE setting can be attributed to initial setup time where shares are received from the encryption agents, which increases with more data providers and may dominate a smaller computation time. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> also discuss computation time and setup times separately and show that computation time indeed grows much slowly than the total time (computation + setup time). We also observed that the behavior w.r.t. local and global data may vary with the implementation of the MPC program but generally, grows slowly with the number of data providers. We zoom into the graphs by showing one observation point in Table <a href="#S5.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ V-C Empirical Analysis ‣ V Empirical Evaluation ‣ Decentralised, Scalable and Privacy-Preserving Synthetic Data Generation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>. In the MPC only setting, the amount of global data exchanged to complete the computation is nearly 360 GB, compared to the much more manageable size of 357 MB in our approach. This is an orders of magnitude improvement.</p>

The code was run without MPC or SGX as it does not affect the measured value. We use a dataset with a skewed distribution for this experiment. This is because we initialise MWEM with a uniform distribution and thus a skewed dataset would require more iterations for it to converge. We observe that the error continues to fall even at 140 iterations where it is around 0.1, suggesting that there is room for further convergence. This is an important property because in the MPC only setting, we found even at a modest 30 iterations, the amount of time approached 50 minutes and the amount of global data exchanged was 360 GB. Our results suggest that running it for further iterations would be impractical. Indeed if we double the number of bins to 20, as we do in figure on the right, we notice the convergence is slower. The appropriate number of bins in a practical implementation would depend on the number of attributes and the domain size but it is reasonable to expect that real world datasets, such as Adults and Titanic that we use in the next section, would preclude us from using a MPC only approach.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p7.1" class="ltx_p">So far we have discussed results obtained using the MASCOT protocol (simulating dishonest majority setting). We now report the results for the Shamir protocol to simulate an honest majority setting. Results are shown in Figures <a href="#S5.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ V-C Empirical Analysis ‣ V Empirical Evaluation ‣ Decentralised, Scalable and Privacy-Preserving Synthetic Data Generation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a> and <a href="#S5.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ V-C Empirical Analysis ‣ V Empirical Evaluation ‣ Decentralised, Scalable and Privacy-Preserving Synthetic Data Generation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a> for fixed total data and variable total data settings using the simulated dataset. Being a more efficient protocol due to relaxed adversarial assumptions, we see some clear differences in the behaviour of the metrics under both approaches. Consequently we note that values for time, global and local data are significantly lower than in Mascot. This is despite the fact that the number of communication rounds (around 190000) is not that far off from the rounds in the Mascot setting (approximately 320000), indicating that communication is noticeably cheaper in an honest majority setting. We also observe that the time for both MPC only and MPC+TEE grows linearly at roughly the same rate in this case.</p>

<p id="S5.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Having carefully analysed the difference between the MPC only and the MPC+TEE approaches using simulated datasets, we now benchmark the MPC+TEE approach using real-world datasets. In particular, we benchmark the performance of different synthetic data generation algorithms such as PGM and Local Consistency (<span id="S5.SS4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mbi.FactoredInference</span> and <span id="S5.SS4.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mbi.LocalInference</span>) in the proposed MPC+TEE approach with common datasets like Adults and Titanic. In the figures in this section, the results of the MPC+TEE approach will also be more clearly visible since we will not include the MPC only approach which would increase the scale of Y-axis in the the figures.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We first benchmark the performance of the MPC+TEE approach with the PGM algorithm on 10 two-dimensional marginals of the Adult dataset using the Shamir protocol. The reason we did not consider a larger number of marginals is because of memory limitations we encountered on our compute while running PGM rather than the scalability of the approach to real world high-dimensional datasets. Each data provider represented a single record from Adults. PGM was run for 30 iterations with no change to the other hyper-parameters. The results are shown in Figure <a href="#S5.F11" title="Figure 11 ‣ V-D Benchmarks on Real Datasets ‣ V Empirical Evaluation ‣ Decentralised, Scalable and Privacy-Preserving Synthetic Data Generation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a>. Despite the large number of attributes (14), many of which have a large domain (maximum 100), our approach keeps the computation time at less than 1400 seconds even with 1000 data providers. While the amount of data exchanged grows linearly, it still remains at a manageable 1400 MB global data for 1000 providers.</p>

<p id="S5.SS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We also benchmark the performance of the MPC+TEE approach with PGM on the Titanic dataset using the Shamir protocol. We consider all two-dimensional marginals over the 7 attributes resulting in 21 histograms in total. Again PGM is run for 30 iterations. Each data provider represents a single record from Titanic.

Despite considering a greater number of marginals than Adult, we see that it scales better on Titanic across all metrics. This can be attributed to the larger domain size of attributes.

While the differences are not significant to be visible in the figures, we observed that on both the Adult and the distributed Adult dataset, Local Consistency based generation takes approximately 30 seconds less time than PGM. On the other hand in the Titanic dataset, Local Consistency based inference takes about 1-1.5 seconds longer than PGM. We also observed, for example, that Local Consistency does not run into the same memory limitations that we encountered when considering more marginals in PGM. The communication rounds, local data and global data does not vary between PGM and Local Consistency in our experiments due to our implementation (steps in MPC do not differ).</p>

<div id="S5.SS5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One of the takeaways from the results presented above is that the MPC only approach is very costly compared to the proposed MPC+TEE approach, particularly in the dishonest majority settings. Dishonest majority setting is important because if the data providers do not trust common computation agents, a dishonest majority protocol like MASCOT is unavoidable. The difference in cost is significant even in the honest majority setting. While all experiments were conducted in a LAN setting, a truly decentralised implementation of Solid+MPC would be over the internet where such costs are major concerns.</p>

However, when we look at the maximum time in our proposed MPC+TEE approach and PGM, Adult is only just over 6 times that of Titanic. Another axis of comparison is to look at the size of the histograms rather than the domain of attributes that are queried. For the marginal queries we considered, this gives us 14739 for Adult vs 3285 for Titanic. From this we observe a linear growth in metrics as the histogram size increases. Considering that in large datasets the number of low-dimensional histograms is likely to be much smaller than the number of data providers, the number of marginals considered does not appear to be a bottleneck. Indeed, as we noted previously, it was the PGM generation algorithm that prevented us from considering more marginals. This is important because training on a greater number of marginals increases the versatility of the synthetic dataset by giving accurate results on a wider range of tasks.</p>

<div id="S5.SS6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A problem we encountered during our experimentation was that the compilation time of our MPC code was quite long. This often resulted in the client-side code making a connection to a not as of yet open port. This was fixed by adding sleep statements in certain places (it did not affect the comparison results though). We considered the MPC app sending over compiled byte code instead of the raw source code as a potential fix. But in the end, we followed the same strategy as Libertas <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> and agreed that the ability to examine the raw source code by an end user offered a useful protection against malicious actors. Nevertheless, synchronisation between the encryption and computation agents regarding when the MPC program is ready to accept a client connection is a challenge that must be overcome for wider adoption.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We also note that we did not benchmark the performance of PGM and Local Consistency with the MPC only approach. This is because the ecosystem for running MPC programs is still developing and as such there is no mechanism to take an existing library such as MBI and compile it to MPC code. This is exacerbated by the many dependencies of MBI on different ML libraries. Even MP-SPDZ, which includes machine learning capabilities, only implements a limited range of functionality from popular ML libraries. Extrapolating from our results from MWEM, we can reasonably expect the MPC only approach to scale poorly, but this would be an interesting direction for further investigation.</p>

The first is local differential privacy methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>, <a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>, <a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>, <a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>, <a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite>. The accuracy of query results in the local model is typically orders of magnitude lower for the same privacy cost and the same query, compared to central differential privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. On the other hand, we use central differential privacy using other privacy-enhancing technologies such as MPC and TEE and therefore, the privacy-utility tradeoff is the same as in central model. We show that one can limit MPC use to strictly necessary for addressing the scalability challenge. The second line of work either proposes to use blockchains for decentralised data and access control or focuses on synthetic data generation process or other computations from distributed data. Examples from this very large body of work include <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>, <a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>, <a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>, <a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>]</cite>. The weaknesses of blockchains based approaches include 1) for personal data, blockchains are considered too transparent. Off-chain hosting of data, which is often suggested as an alternative to address this concern, does not really solve the problem but merely delegates it. 2) the guarantees provided by blockchains such as immutability are not required (and may even be undesired) in many use-cases and come with huge costs. On the other hand, we use Solid (a personal data store) which provides everything we need and is based on open web protocols.</p>

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we argue for a paradigm shifting, contributor-centric approach to responsible synthetic data generation. Personal data stores such as Solid provide individuals ultimate control over their data. Users keep their data in Pods (Personal Online Datastores). The apps and services that they use (for e.g. various web based applications, online social platforms, health service applications etc), read and write data to the user’s Pod. A Pod provides granular control to users over who can access which data. In the proposed approach for synthetic data generation, the real data remains with individuals in their Solid pods. Individuals use Solid’s access control mechanism to decide whether they want to participate in the synthetic data generation process (for example, by taking into account what is the purpose of synthetic data generation and which real data is required as input). We show how participating individuals can then use secure multi-party computation (MPC) and Intel SGX for running differentially-private synthetic data generation algorithms. Our comprehensive experiments in different experimental settings show the practical scalability.</p>
</div>
<div id="S8.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p2.1" class="ltx_p">While this work was primarily empirical with a focus on practical implementation, there is much scope for theoretical work such as examining how computation agents can be incentivised by the ecosystem. Further, there are other personal data stores such as openPDS and Databox with different capabilities than Solid. We expect to see similar trends on those platforms under similar experiments, but there could be interesting variations in the cause of performance bottlenecks and worth investigating. Similarly there are other frameworks for MPC, many derived from MP-SPDZ and some independent <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>]</cite>. While communication costs impose a natural challenge, more efficient implementations of the underlying protocols could also contribute to more scalable synthetic data generation. Finally, we have focused on tabular data in this work whereas Solid also has support for unstructured data such as text and images. There has been much success in private synthetic data generation of images using GANs and diffusion models, such as PATE-GAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>]</cite>. An interesting direction for future inquiry would be to improve their scalability in a decentralised setting.</p>
