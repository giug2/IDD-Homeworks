<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Computer Vision (CV) is playing a significant role in transforming society by utilizing machine learning (ML) tools for a wide range of tasks. However, the need for large-scale datasets to train ML models creates challenges for centralized ML algorithms. The massive computation loads required for processing and the potential privacy risks associated with storing and processing data on central cloud servers put these algorithms under severe strain. To address these issues, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution, allowing privacy preservation by training models locally and exchanging them to improve overall performance. Additionally, the computational load is distributed across multiple clients, reducing the burden on central servers.
This paper presents, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, the first review discussing recent advancements of FL in CV applications, comparing them to conventional centralized training paradigms. It provides an overview of current FL applications in various CV tasks, emphasizing the advantages of FL and the challenges of implementing it in CV. To facilitate this, the paper proposes a taxonomy of FL techniques in CV, outlining their applications and security threats. It also discusses privacy concerns related to implementing blockchain in FL schemes for CV tasks and summarizes existing privacy preservation methods. Moving on, the paper identifies open research challenges and potential future research directions to further exploit the potential of FL and blockchain in CV applications.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, the emergence and evolution of machine learning (ML) has carved out a distinct niche for itself within the broader realm of artificial intelligence (AI). Specifically, ML emphasizes the design, development, and training of algorithms and software agents to sift through, interpret, and make data-driven decisions based on patterns hidden within vast datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. These artificial agents are increasingly being equipped with multifaceted sensory capabilities that allow them to interact more intuitively with their environment. Among these, vision stands out as the most profound, granting machines the ability to ’see’ and ’understand’ the world around them in ways comparable to human cognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
Given the intrinsic importance of visual data, computer vision (CV) has rapidly risen to prominence within the ML community. CV seeks to enable machines to interpret and derive meaningful conclusions from visual data, mimicking the human ability to recognize, process, and respond to visual stimuli <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. This capability not only empowers artificial agents to better grasp their surroundings but also paves the way for more informed decision-making processes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. By incorporating CV techniques, artificial agents can move beyond mere data analysis, delving into a more profound comprehension of the visual realm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. The integration of such insights holds the potential to revolutionize various domains by enhancing the depth of understanding and the efficacy of decision-making processes in AI systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Understanding the contents and concepts of an image involves a significant amount of information which is connected with image segmentation, extraction of features and objects, and synthesis of the scene as a whole <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Although the CV and perception task is reflexively performed by humans, grace to their ability for abstraction, it is still quite complex for artificial agents <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. It is also hard for humans to explain how they perceive the world and develop ML modules that behave in a similar manner <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
The four main techniques that are employed for training machines to perform CV tasks are either based on statistics (i.e. on patterns learned from large training datasets), on the logic expressed in the form of rules, on deep neural networks (DNNs) that capture the non-linear relations between image features and the final decision or on genetic and evolutionary algorithms that combine multiple decisions in order to find the one that maximizes the overall performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The huge advancements and impressive results in the performance of CV algorithms in tasks such as image classification, image segmentation, object detection, and scene perception, came from a shift from signal processing methods to solutions that rely on deep learning (DL) methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. The biggest challenge for DL methods is that they require huge computational resources and energy for training, which in turn makes them hardly applicable in many application setups, where decisions have to be taken on the edge, using low resources and limited power (e.g. in drones, mobile phones, etc.) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.
For this purpose low-power CV challenges have been established and new energy-efficient algorithms and light-weight DL architectures have been proposed, such as reservoir computing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, or random neural networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Another challenge for CV systems is the protection of user privacy.
Collecting millions of people’s images and videos poses serious privacy risks, which must be seriously considered <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. First of all, the right to be forgotten is constantly violated by companies that collect visual data and retain it permanently or use it for multiple purposes. Also, through numerous flaws, such delicate visual data could be exploited or exposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. Secondly, the privacy-preserving analysis of images and videos from video surveillance applications, where CV methods are used to detect violations (e.g. mask-wearing, distance keeping, etc.) in public spaces can be quite challenging too <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. Such videos frequently include inadvertently caught private objects including faces, car plates, computer screens, and more. The ability of methods to detect and even identify humans and other objects in unconstrained environments can put at risk the anonymity of people in monitored places and, if not used properly, can become a threat to citizen privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The rise of edge computing architectures has introduced a new potential to privacy-preserving CV, since with the proper use of the limited edge resources, it has become possible to perform basic CV tasks without transferring sensitive data to the cloud <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
Sharing the trained model rather than releasing the actual data also helps to retain the privacy of the data, without losing on prediction performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.
Due to their built-in privacy-preserving features, federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> and split learning (SL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> are the two ML techniques, that perform on visual data on a distributed manner and have attracted the interest of researchers in the CV field. Such approaches assume a client-server (edge-cloud) architecture, where the clients usually have fewer resources than the server. The clients train their models individually, using their own data, and then exchange their models either with the server or among them in order to synchronize what they learned <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. The ML models are trained locally on the client (edge) devices and this happens in parallel, as long as the clients receive and process training data. Periodically, they exchange models and aggregate them following simple or more sophisticated strategies, which may involve additional training on the cloud for avoiding the bias introduced in the clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. In the case of SL the training of the model layers is also split between the edge and the cloud. Only a few layers are trained on the edge, in order to facilitate training with little resources, and the remaining layers are trained on the cloud <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">A risk that emerges from this distributed training process for CV models is the exposure to malicious users that intentionally introduce noise or falsified models in order to bias the FL model for their benefit <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. Adversarial training techniques can be employed to strengthen the FL models, but even adversarial training has leakages <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. The use of blockchain technologies can help mitigate many of the threats of data or model-sharing methods. All the model-sharing activities of a node that is allowed to share are stored as transactions in the blockchain and all information about the providers’ profiles is also stored in the blockchain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. In this multi-party setup, when a node needs to update its model by using the models of other nodes, first performs a request for models to its neighbouring nodes, then validates the nodes by checking the blockchain and retrieves their models from the blockchain. The resulting FL model is consequently stored on the blockchain in a new transaction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FL is emerging as a powerful machine learning paradigm that allows for the training of AI models across numerous decentralized devices while maintaining data privacy. In essence, FL enables devices to collaboratively learn a shared model without having to share raw data, a feature that holds immense potential for applications in diverse domains, particularly in CV. In CV, the applications of FL range from object detection and image classification to semantic segmentation, among others, with an array of potential real-world use cases in sectors such as healthcare, autonomous driving, and surveillance systems. However, the adoption of FL in CV is not without its challenges. Issues related to model performance, communication efficiency, data heterogeneity, and privacy preservation need to be addressed and carefully managed. This systematic literature review aims to delve deep into these challenges, exploring the progress, limitations, and future directions of applying FL in the realm of CV. The review will address several research questions that encapsulate the core facets of this intriguing intersection of FL and CV, which can summarized in Table <a href="#S1.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ I-A Survey Methodology ‣ I Introduction ‣ Federated Learning for Computer Vision" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>.</p>

CL refers to a cooperative approach in which multiple entities actively participate and share their data and model updates to collectively train a shared model. It involves a collaborative effort where participants collaborate and contribute to the model’s training by sharing their local knowledge and insights <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>.
CL, within the context of FL, specifically refers to the scenario where participants actively collaborate and exchange data and model updates among themselves to collectively improve the shared model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>.

Although this is a common FL objective, there are other alternatives, such as multi-task learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>, where related local models are learned simultaneously and each client corresponds to a task. Both multi-task learning and meta-learning allow for personalized or device-specific modeling, which can be a useful approach to handle the statistical heterogeneity of the data in FL. While FL and classical distributed learning both aim to minimize the empirical risk across distributed entities, there are several challenges that must be addressed when implementing this objective in a federated setting.</p>

Precisely, for better integrating the parameters of client models in the frequency domain, a progressive Fourier aggregation (PFA) is used at the server. Next, a deputy-enhanced transfer (DET) is designed at the clients’ side to easily share overall knowledge with the personalized local model. In particular, the approach involves the development of PFA at the server, which ensures a stable and efficient gathering of global knowledge. This is achieved by gradually integrating client models from low-frequency to high-frequency. Additionally, the authors introduce a deputy model at the client’s end to receive the aggregated server model. This facilitates the implementation of the DET strategy, which follows three types of decisions (<math id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="d_{k}" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><msub id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">d</mi><mi id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">k</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝑑</ci><ci id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑘</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1c">d_{k}</annotation></semantics></math>): Recover-Exchange-Sublimate. These steps aim to enhance the personalized local model by smoothly transferring global knowledge. In this process, the advantage of utilizing the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is to obtain both the amplitude map and the phase map of the parameters (conversion from parameters to map).

<div id="S2.SS3.SSS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FL group knowledge transfer (FedGKT) represents a streamlined FL approach tailored to edge devices with limited resources. Its primary objective is to combine the advantages of FedAvg and split learning (SL) by employing local stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training, similar to FedAvg, while simultaneously ensuring low computational burden at the edge, akin to SL. Notably, FedGKT facilitates the seamless transmission of knowledge from numerous compact edge-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to a significantly larger CNN trained at a cloud server. Fig. <a href="#S2.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ II-C3 FedGKT aggregation ‣ II-C Aggregation approaches in FL ‣ II Background of FL ‣ Federated Learning for Computer Vision" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a> illustrates the overview of FedGKT, (i) at the edge device, a compact CNN is employed, comprising a lightweight feature extractor and classifier, efficiently trained using its private data (local training). (ii) Following local training, consensus is reached among all edge nodes to generate uniform tensor dimensions as output from the feature extractor. Subsequently, the larger server model is trained, wherein the extracted features from the edge-side model serve as inputs. The training process employs a knowledge distillation (KD)-based loss function <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> to minimize the disparity between ground truth and soft label predictions, representing probabilistic estimations obtained from the edge-side model ( Periodic transfer). (iii) To enhance the edge model’s performance, the server conveys its predicted soft labels to the edge, enabling the edge to conduct further training on its local dataset using a KD-based loss function with the server’s soft labels ( Transfer back). As a result, both the server and edge models mutually benefit from knowledge exchange, leading to performance improvement. (iv) After completion of the training process, the final model is a fusion of the local feature extractor and the shared server model ( Edge-sided model) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>. The researchers who proposed FedGKT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> claimed that it enables cost-effective edge training by significantly reducing computational expenses. In comparison to edge training with FedAvg, FedGKT demands only 9 to 17 times less computational power (measured in FLOPs) and requires a substantially smaller number of parameters, ranging from 54 to 105 times fewer.</p>

<p id="S2.SS4.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Secure MPC (SMPC) models involve data from multiple parties and use a well-defined simulation framework to provide safety certification. These models are designed to ensure that there is no interaction or sharing of knowledge data between the parties, meaning that users are unaware of the input and output data as well as any other information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>. This zero-knowledge model can be considered a form of secure and complex computing protocol that is based on publicly available knowledge.

The MPC protocol enables model training and verification without requiring users to share sensitive data. However, SMPC has certain limitations. It is unable to prevent servers from being curious and may not provide sufficient protection against privacy attacks from other clients. Additionally, the four-round interactive nature of the protocol can lead to wasted data and reduced model accuracy as the server does not have access to the client data until the submission phase is completed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S2.SS4.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS4.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Differential privacy technology, as indicated by past studies, has been employed as a protective measure for data privacy, where it processes and obscures sensitive attributes. This practice makes it challenging for third parties to identify individual users, thus rendering the data irrecoverable <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>, <a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite>. However, this method necessitates the transfer of data, which can negatively impact data accuracy, indicating a compromise between accuracy and privacy in such scenarios.
In addition, some researchers have suggested the incorporation of differential privacy within FL to safeguard client data by masking client contributions during training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite>. For instance, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>]</cite> introduced a differentially private FL framework for analyzing histopathology images, which are considered some of the most intricate medical images. The authors assessed how data distribution, the number of healthcare providers, and individual dataset sizes influenced the framework’s performance. They used the cancer genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset, an openly accessible repository, to mimic a distributed environment.
Furthermore, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite> presented an FL framework capable of generating a global model from distributed health data stored in diverse locations, without the need to move or share raw data. This framework also ensures privacy protection through differential privacy. An evaluation using real electronic health data from a million patients across two healthcare applications indicated the framework’s success in delivering considerable privacy without compromising the global model’s utility.</p>

<p id="S2.SS4.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Differential privacy can be used in the training of DNN through the use of the differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) algorithm. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite> introduces deepee, a free and open-source framework for differentially private DL that is compatible with the PyTorch DL framework for medical image analysis. This study uses parallel processing to calculate and modify the gradients for each sample. This process is made efficient through the use of a data structure that stores shared memory references to the neural network weights in order to save memory. It also provides specialized data loading procedures and privacy budget tracking based on the Gaussian differential privacy framework, as well as the ability to automatically modify the user-provided neural network architecture to ensure that it adheres to DP standards. Besides, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite> incorporates FL into the DL of medical image analysis models to enhance the protection of local models and prevent adversaries from inferring private medical data through attacks such as model reconstruction or model inversion. Cryptographic techniques such as masks and homomorphic encryption are utilized. Instead of relying on the size of the datasets, as is commonly done in DL, the contribution rate of each local model to the global model during each training epoch is determined based on the qualities of the datasets owned by the participating entities. Additionally, a dropout-tolerant approach for FL is presented in which the process is not interrupted if the number of online clients is above a predetermined threshold.</p>

<div id="S2.SS4.SSS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS4.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Homomorphic encryption is a type of encryption used in the ML process that uses parameter exchange to protect the privacy of user data. Unlike differential privacy, it does not transmit the data or models themselves and encrypts the data without allowing it to be discovered. This makes it less likely for the original data to be leaked. The additive homomorphic encryption model is the most commonly used version in practice.
Besides, despite the benefits of FL, there is a risk that private or sensitive personal data may be exposed through membership attacks when model parameters or summary statistics are shared with a central site. To address this issue, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>]</cite> presents a secure FL-based framework that employs fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). In doing so, the Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) construction has been used,
which enables the execution of approximate calculations, on real and floating-point numbers benefiting from ciphertext rescaling and packing. Moving on, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>]</cite> introduces a homomorphic encryption and blockchain-based privacy-preserving aggregation framework for medical image analysis.
This allows hospitals to collaborate and train encrypted federated models while maintaining data privacy, using blockchain ledger technology to decentralize the FL process without the need for a central server.
Specifically, homomorphic encryption protects the privacy of the model’s gradients. This framework involves training a local model using a capsule network for the segmentation and classification of COVID-19 images, securing the local model with the homomorphic encryption scheme, and sharing the model over a decentralized platform using a blockchain-based FL algorithm.</p>

<p id="S2.SS5.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Unsupervised FL is a variant of FL in which the participating devices do not have access to labeled data. Instead, they must rely on unsupervised learning techniques, such as clustering or dimensionality reduction, to learn useful representations of the data. This can be useful in scenarios where collecting and annotating labeled data is difficult or expensive, or where the data is highly sensitive and cannot be shared with a centralized server. The learning process can be implemented using federated principal component analysis (PCA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">63</a>]</cite>, federated k-means <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>]</cite>, etc.</p>

<p id="S2.SS5.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FL allows training ML algorithms with a semi-supervised learning (SSL) process on remote datasets without the need to share the data itself. However, data annotation remains a challenge, especially in fields like medicine and surgery where specialized knowledge is often required. To address this issue, semi-supervised FL has recently been used where the participating devices have access to a dataset that contains both labeled and unlabeled examples. The labeled examples are used to train a model using supervised learning techniques, while the unlabeled examples are used to learn additional useful features using unsupervised techniques such as clustering or dimensionality reduction.

<p id="S2.SS5.SSS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this direction, Kassem et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib65" title="" class="ltx_ref">65</a>]</cite> propose FedCy, a federated SSL (FSSL) system that combines FL with self-supervised learning to improve the performance of surgical phase recognition using a decentralized dataset containing both labeled and unlabeled videos. FedCy uses temporal patterns in the labeled data to guide the unsupervised training of unlabeled data towards task-specific features for phase recognition. This scheme outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) FSSL methods on the task of automatically recognizing surgical phases using a multi-institutional dataset of laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos. Additionally, it learns more generalizable features when tested on data from an unseen domain.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">66</a>]</cite> examines the effectiveness of SOTA video SSL techniques when used in a large-scale FL setting, as simulated using the kinetics-400 dataset. The limitations of these techniques in this context are identified before introducing a new federated SSL framework for a video called FedVSSL. FedVSSL incorporates various aggregation strategies and partial weight updates and has been shown through experiments to outperform centralized SOTA by 6.66% on UCF-101 and 5.13% on HMDB-51 in downstream retrieval tasks.</p>

It includes three main components: (i) an anonymization function, (ii) a self-supervised privacy removal module, and (iii) an action recognition module. A minimax optimization strategy is used to train this framework, which minimizes the action recognition cost function and maximizes the privacy cost function through a contrastive self-supervised loss. By using existing protocols for known action and privacy attributes, this framework achieves a good balance between action recognition and privacy protection, similar to the current SOTA supervised methods. Additionally, a new protocol to test the generalization of the learned anonymization function to novel action and privacy attributes is introduced.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">CL techniques that combine the merits of multiple feature learning techniques from images seem to be the most promising technique. The main issue to handle is the separation of the object from its background, any foreground occlusions, or noise. Other important issues related to the size and variety of objects to be detected in the same image and the need to track objects across consecutive or groups of images. For example, the work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib71" title="" class="ltx_ref">71</a>]</cite> emphasized on the use of RGB-D methods that combine RGB images with depth images in order to improve the SOD across multiple images. They proposed a CL framework (CoNet), which combines the edge information extracted from low-level features of the images with the merits of a spatial attention map that detects salient features in the images and depth images that better locate salient objects in a scene. The three different collaborators are combined in a knowledge collector module that first concatenates salient and edge features to jointly learn the boundaries and locations of salient objects and then uses the depth information to separate salient regions from their background. Another work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib72" title="" class="ltx_ref">72</a>]</cite> presents a NN architecture for content-aware segmentation of sets of images that employs co-saliency maps generated from the input images using a group CL framework (GCoNet). The proposed method outperforms standard SOD alternatives and is capable of detecting co-salient objects in real-time. The main criteria employed are the compactness of the extracted objects within the group of images and the separability of objects from other noise objects in the scenes.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Moving on, the research work on hand detection and tracking over long videos <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib73" title="" class="ltx_ref">73</a>, <a href="#bib.bib74" title="" class="ltx_ref">74</a>]</cite> focused on the need for fast and long-term object detection even in the presence of temporal occlusions and changes among frames. In order to tackle these problems, the researchers suggested the use of a hand detection model (Based on faster R-CNN) combined with the projection across an image (frame) sequences in order to detect clusters of bounding boxes that remain almost stable across frames, even if they are occluded in some of the frames. In order to handle the problem of occlusions, aspect changes and articulations that may hinder the proper detection of objects in uncontrolled scenes, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib75" title="" class="ltx_ref">75</a>]</cite> propose a method that first detects object parts and consequently tries to associate them and detect the object. The detected object parts are called granules, i.e. small areas with simple properties (e.g. color) that separate them from their context. Using a combinatorial optimization method, based on simulated annealing, they learn how to associate the proper neighboring granules that compose the object. The problem of overlapping objects is also discussed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib76" title="" class="ltx_ref">76</a>]</cite>, where the authors propose a new object detection algorithm that improves the localization of the detected objects and suppresses redundant detection boxes, using a better loss function.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, CL for medical image segmentation and classification has been applied by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib77" title="" class="ltx_ref">77</a>]</cite>. The authors distinguish between the image segmentation and annotation of segments task, and that of detecting the severity of the disease by considering the image as a whole. They propose the use of CL method for disease severity classification that is based on attention over the detected and annotated segments. A weakly supervised framework for CL is proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib78" title="" class="ltx_ref">78</a>]</cite> for allowing object detection using labels at the image level. The proposed framework combines a weakly supervised learner (i.e. a two-stream CNN built on VGG16) with a strongly supervised learner (i.e. faster-RCNN) and trains the two subnetworks in a collaborative manner. The former subnetwork optimizes the multi-label classification task, whereas the later optimize the prediction consistency of the detected objects’ bounding boxes. Another weakly supervised object detection approach that employs image-level labels in order to learn to detect the accurate location of objects in the training images has been presented by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib79" title="" class="ltx_ref">79</a>]</cite>. A CL framework has first been trained on the image-level labels aiming to optimize the image-level classifier and to assign higher weights to instances with more confidence (i.e. without much noise, with fewer objects and simpler backgrounds). Then, a curriculum learning component is employed for guiding the learning procedure of object localization and classification. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib80" title="" class="ltx_ref">80</a>]</cite>, the authors also propose an object detection method from remote sensing images, which combines a weakly supervised detector for image-level labels and a strongly supervised detector for object localization. In a similar manner, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib81" title="" class="ltx_ref">81</a>]</cite> split the salient object detection task into two sub-tasks that are examined in parallel. The first task relates to the estimation of internal semantics and the second to the prediction of the object boundaries. VGG-16 is used as a basis for feature extraction from images and an additional layer is used to define their semantics. Two decoders are combined for the second part. The first detects the broader area of interest in the images and the second performs a fine-grained boundary detection. The CL network joins the two networks in order to efficiently fuse semantics and boundaries and extract the saliency maps of each image. Combining an image enhancement network with the object recognition network in order to be able to recognize objects in images of extremely low resolution is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib82" title="" class="ltx_ref">82</a>]</cite>. The two networks were trained using a CL technique in which the knowledge from the object recognition network is used to enhance the low-resolution images that are given as input to the other network. The enhanced images are then fed to the classifier to improve its performance. Four different losses (reconstruction, perpetual, classification and edge loss) are combined, in order to optimize the object recognition performance. Transferring the knowledge distillation method in a distributed and CL setup has been proven beneficial for online object detection tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib83" title="" class="ltx_ref">83</a>]</cite>. The student models (one in each node) are trained separately using as their teacher model, an ensemble that comes from the fusion of the student logits. The teacher’s knowledge is then distilled back to the students in the form of a soft target. This logic can easily be ported to the FL paradigm as an alternative to FL-based averaging (FedAvg) or more proficient averaging techniques.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The learning process for object detection is usually handled as a centralized offline task, but in resource-restricted environments and applications that need mobility, privacy, and security decentralized and distributed approaches, as well as cloud-edge collaborative approaches have been proposed. In an attempt to optimize object detection performance, authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib84" title="" class="ltx_ref">84</a>]</cite> proposed an FL approach that improves the performance of the federated averaging model aggregation over independent and identically distributed (IID) data. The main claim of their work is that SOTA DL CNN models have been trained in controlled, centralized and balanced datasets and cannot perform well on non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. Since in cases that need privacy and security, such as in medical images for example, the data can be non-IID, the use of simple federated algorithms, such as FedAvg, can be problematic. For this purpose, they propose a weighted variant of FedAvg that improves FL performance in non-IID image data. Using collaborative intelligence on the edge, or balancing between the edge and the cloud is an efficient FL paradigm that can improve the performance of object detection tasks. The work of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib85" title="" class="ltx_ref">85</a>]</cite> has shown that splitting the deep NN models between the cloud and the edge, apart from being privacy-preserving and secure can also be more efficient for object detection tasks. Efficiency can be achieved by quantizing and compressing the tensors of the first layers before sending them to the final layers that reside in the cloud. Depending on where the split is performed, different compression techniques (lossless or lossy ones) are preferred. The same network split strategy (splitNN) has been used in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib86" title="" class="ltx_ref">86</a>]</cite> for protecting the privacy of medical data. More specifically, the client nodes train the network up to a certain layer and the outputs are sent to the server to perform the rest of the training. The inverse process takes place during the back-propagation of the gradients. In order to further protect the labels of the training samples from exposure to the server, the authors also propose a u-shaped forward and backward propagation process in which the first and last layers of the network (along with the training labels) are kept in the clients. Finally, they propose a vertically partitioned data model in which multiple clients train the same first layers of their networks in parallel and send the outputs to the server that concatenates them before proceeding with the remaining layers. This way the clients share the model (at least the last layers) without sharing their data.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Self-supervised learning (SSL) and its variants, momentum contrast (MoCo), bootstrap your own latent (BYOL), and simple siamese (SimSiam), are powerful techniques for learning representations from centralized data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib87" title="" class="ltx_ref">87</a>]</cite>. FL has been combined with SSL to address privacy concerns with decentralized data. However, there is a lack of in-depth understanding of the fundamental building blocks for federated self-supervised learning (FedSSL). The reference <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib87" title="" class="ltx_ref">87</a>]</cite> introduces a federated hybrid self-supervised learning (FedHSSL) framework that combines VFL and SSL techniques such as SimSiam, addressing data deficiency. FedHSSL utilizes cross-party views and local views of aligned and unaligned samples within each party to enhance representation learning. It also incorporates partial model aggregation using shared generic features among parties. Experimental results show that FedHSSL outperforms baseline methods, particularly when labeled samples are limited. The researchers also analyze privacy protection mechanisms in FedHSSL, demonstrating its effectiveness in thwarting label inference attacks. Moving forward, Zhuang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib88" title="" class="ltx_ref">88</a>]</cite> propose a generalized FedSSL framework that accommodates existing SSL methods based on Siamese networks and allows for flexibility in future methods. Through empirical study, the authors uncover insights that challenge the conventional wisdom, showing that stop-gradient operation is not always necessary in FedSSL and retaining local knowledge of clients is beneficial for non-IID data. Building on these insights, the authors propose a new model update approach called federated divergence-aware exponential moving average (FedEMA) update, which adaptively updates local models of clients using exponential moving average of the global model with dynamically measured decay rate based on model divergence. Experimental results demonstrate that FedEMA outperforms existing methods on linear evaluation. The authors hope that this work provides valuable insights for future research in the field of FedSSL. Saeed et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib89" title="" class="ltx_ref">89</a>]</cite> propose a self-supervised approach called scalogram-signal correspondence learning based on wavelet transform (WT) to learn representations from unlabeled sensor inputs such as electroencephalography, blood volume pulse, accelerometer, and WiFi channel-state information. The proposed method addresses issues related to privacy, bandwidth limitations, and cost of annotations associated with centralized data repositories for supervised learning. The auxiliary task involves a deep temporal neural network to determine if a given pair of a signal and its complementary view align with each other, optimized through a contrastive objective. The learned features are extensively evaluated on various public datasets, demonstrating strong performance in multiple domains. The proposed methodology achieves competitive performance with fully supervised networks and outperforms autoencoders in both central and federated contexts. Notably, it improves generalization in a semi-supervised setting by reducing the volume of labeled data required through leveraging self-supervised learning.</p>

The method utilizes a Transformer-based self-supervised pre-training approach on decentralized target task datasets using masked image modeling. This enables robust representation learning and effective knowledge transfer. Experimental results on simulated and real-world medical imaging non-IID federated datasets demonstrate improved model robustness against data heterogeneity. The approach achieves significant enhancements in test accuracy on retinal, dermatology, and chest X-ray classification without additional pre-training data, outperforming a supervised baseline with ImageNet pre-training. The FedSSL pre-training approach demonstrates better generalization to out-of-distribution data and improved performance with limited labeled data compared to existing FL algorithms.

When visual data are collected by surveillance cameras, the monitoring of face mask-wearing can be split into two separate tasks: i) the detection of faces, ii) the detection of proper mask-wearing. The second task poses a risk to user privacy, making FL the preferred approach. The proposed scheme utilizes a dilation retina-Net face location network for <span id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">detecting</span> faces, including both clear and occluded ones, in a dense crowd.

<p id="S3.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">An application that attracts the interest of CV researchers in terms of balancing the workload between centralized (cloud) and distributed (edge-based) architectures is video surveillance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib92" title="" class="ltx_ref">92</a>]</cite>. Edge computing has offered several solutions in the direction of workload balancing. However, it added new challenges concerning the compression and filtering of data that is transmitted over the communication network, and the fragmentation of knowledge across the edge devices. In order to tackle the aforementioned projects, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib93" title="" class="ltx_ref">93</a>]</cite> propose a multi-layer design in order to minimize the communication between the edge and the cloud and employ FL to update the detection models without sending training data to the cloud. The multi-layer architecture comprises a data acquisition layer on the edge that performs compression and filtering, an object detection and identification layer with edge servers that are specialized in specific tasks (e.g. face recognition, licence plate detection, etc.) and a FL layer that solves tasks on the edge and marks data and models that must communicated to the cloud. The information transferred to the cloud usually comprises model parameters and the respective weights.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A generic FL architecture that processes sensor data for human activity recognition has been presented by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib94" title="" class="ltx_ref">94</a>]</cite>. The proposed FL architecture is based on a federated aggregator that is trained using local data on the edge nodes. The aggregator sends the models to a central entity where the Federated Average algorithm is employed to generate a common model that is distributed back to the edge nodes. The federated aggregator in the video surveillance scenario could be a local server that is trained on the edge using local data.
Moving on, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib95" title="" class="ltx_ref">95</a>]</cite> introduces a FL framework based on a lightweight version of the Dense-MobileNet model for processing aerial images collected by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) swarms. The UAV swarms used for vision sensing collect haze images, and are supported by ground sensors that collect information about air quality. Each UAV employs a ML model in order to correlate air quality with the haze images and shares its trained gradient with a central server. The server combines the gradients a learns a global model, which is then used to predict air-quality distribution in the region.
Besides, platforms that supports FL powered applications of CV in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib96" title="" class="ltx_ref">96</a>, <a href="#bib.bib97" title="" class="ltx_ref">97</a>]</cite>. Lia et al. in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib96" title="" class="ltx_ref">96</a>]</cite> demonstrate FedVision in a fire detection task, using a YOLOv3 model for object detection and they report its use on three pilots concerning safety hazard detection, photovoltaic panel monitoring and suspicious transaction monitoring in ATMs via cameras. Catalfamo et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib97" title="" class="ltx_ref">97</a>]</cite> thoroughly examine the use of edge federation for implementing ML-based solutions. The platform is introduced for deploying and managing complex services on the edge that utilizes micro-services, which are small, independent, and loosely-connected services. This platform enables the management of these services across a network of edge devices by abstracting the physical devices they run on. The the effectiveness of this solution was demonstrated through a case study involving video analysis in the field of morphology.</p>

In doing so, fine-tuning is used since small datasets are not appropriate for action recognition models to learn complex spatio-temporal features.
Moving forward, an asynchronous federated optimization is adopted and the convergence bound has been shown since the present clients’ computing resources were heterogeneous. In a different paradigm, a driver action recognition system is built by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib99" title="" class="ltx_ref">99</a>]</cite> using FL. The latter has been used for model training to protect users’ privacy while enabling online model upgrades. Similarly, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>, an FL-based driver activity recognition system is implemented by training the detection model in a decentralized fashion.
FedAvg and FedGKT have been implemented and their performance has been demonstrated on the 2022 AI City Challenge. Zhao et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>]</cite> proposed a semi-supervised FL for activity recognition, which helps edge devices conducting unsupervised learning of general representations using autoencoders and non annotated local data.

However, when the distributed nodes are not trusted in advance, or when the quality of their data is ambiguous, more control mechanisms and incentives are needed to avoid the deterioration of the resulting model.
When the distributed trainers have to co-operate in order to reach a consensus, either it is for crowd counting or for any other task, it is important to provide them enough incentives in order to become trustful <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib102" title="" class="ltx_ref">102</a>]</cite>. Blockchain-based approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib103" title="" class="ltx_ref">103</a>]</cite> manage to distribute the incentive among the trained models and evaluate their reliability in order to fairly partition any potential profit (or trust).

<div id="S3.SS4.SSS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS4.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">An interesting data mining task with many CV applications is anomaly detection. It involves the identification of strange patterns in data, which may indicate a fake or incorrect situation. Several cutting-edge ML and DL algorithms have been developed in the literature in order to detect and prevent such incidents. When it comes to CV various DL architectures, from variational autoencoders (VAE), generative adversarial networks (GANs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can be trained to detect anomalies in video sequences <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib104" title="" class="ltx_ref">104</a>]</cite>.
The capitalization of the use of autoencoders and FL for detecting anomalies is introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib105" title="" class="ltx_ref">105</a>]</cite>. The bipartite structure of autoencoders, and their ability to reconstruct the input in their output, allows the detection of anomalies based on the errors spotted during the regeneration of the input. The authors train two clients using different parts of the training dataset and they merge the resulting models using FL library called PySyft for secure and private DL. They employ the MSE loss metric to compare the input and output and examine whether it exceeds a threshold in order to decide whether it is an anomaly or not. Bharti et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib106" title="" class="ltx_ref">106</a>]</cite> have proposed an edge-enabled FL approach for the automatic inspection of products using CV. Their main basis is SqueezeNet, a lightweight model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, which is able to identify 100 different types of objects. Although the image processing model has been trained using multiple images of normal products the various defects are detected using an anomaly detection algorithm. SqueezeNet acts as a feature extractor from images, which are then fed to a dense layer with as many output neurons as possible anomaly classes, plus one for the normal products. In its federated version, the edge server aggregates the various local models and computes a new global model that is reshared with the local nodes.

<div id="S3.SS5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Nowadays, DL methods with large-scale datasets can produce clinically useful models for computer-aided diagnosis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib107" title="" class="ltx_ref">107</a>]</cite>. However, privacy and ethical concerns are increasingly critical, which makes it difficult to collect large quantities of data from multiple institutions. FL provides a promising decentralized solution to CL by exchanging client models instead of private data. Sheller et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib108" title="" class="ltx_ref">108</a>]</cite> performed the first study that investigated the use of FL for multi-institutional collaboration, and enabled the training of DL models without sharing patients’ data. In particular, the aggregation process involves calculating a weighted average of institutional updates, where each institution’s weight is determined by the proportion of total data instances it holds. This entire process, comprising local training, update aggregation, and distribution of new parameters, is referred to as a federated round. Linardos et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> modeled cardiovascular magnetic resonance using a FL scheme that concentrated on the diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A 3D-CNN model, pre-trained on action recognition, was deployed. Moreover, shape prior information has been integrated into 3D-CNN using two techniques and four data augmentation strategies (Fig. <a href="#S3.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ III-E Healthcare and medical AI ‣ III Applications of FL in CV ‣ Federated Learning for Computer Vision" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>). This approach has then been evaluated on the automatic cardiac diagnosis challenge (ACDC) dataset. The multi-site fMRI classification problem is addressed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib109" title="" class="ltx_ref">109</a>]</cite> while preserving privacy using a FL model. Accordingly, a decentralized iterative optimization has been deployed before using a randomization mechanism to alter shared local model weights. In the same way, Dayan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib110" title="" class="ltx_ref">110</a>]</cite> developed and trained a FL model on data from data from 20 institutes worldwide, namely EMR chest X-ray AI model (EXAM). The latter was built based on the COV-2 clinical decision support (CDS) model. This helps predict the future oxygen requirements of COVID-19 patients using chest X-rays, laboratory data, and inputs of vital signs. In the same way, an FL-based solution that screens COVID-19 from chest X-ray (CXR) images is deployed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib111" title="" class="ltx_ref">111</a>]</cite>.
In addition, a communication-efficient CNN-based FL scheme to multi-chest diseases classification from CXR images is proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib112" title="" class="ltx_ref">112</a>]</cite>. Yan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib113" title="" class="ltx_ref">113</a>]</cite> proposed a real-time contribution measurement approach for participants in FL, which is called Fedcm. The latter has been applied to identify COVID-19 based on medical images. Moving forward, Roth et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib114" title="" class="ltx_ref">114</a>]</cite> deployed a FL approach for building medical imaging breast density classification solutions. Data from seven clinical institutions around the world has been used to train the FL algorithm.</p>

<p id="S3.SS5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Because of the gaps in fMRI distributions from distinct sites, a mixture of experts domain adaptation (MoE-DA) and adversarial domain alignment (ADA) schemes have been integrated into the FL algorithm. The reference <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib115" title="" class="ltx_ref">115</a>]</cite> introduced a variation-aware FL approach, in which the variations between clients have been reduced by transforming the images of all clients onto a common image space. A privacy-preserving generative adversarial network, namely PPWGAN-GP is introduced. Moving on, a modified CycleGAN is deployed for every client to transfer its raw images to the target image space defined by the shared synthesized images. Accordingly, this helps address the cross-client variation problem while preserving privacy. Similarly, for data privacy-preserving, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib116" title="" class="ltx_ref">116</a>]</cite> used a FL scheme to securely access and meta-analyze biomedical data without sharing individual information. Specifically, brain structural relationships are investigated across clinical cohorts and diseases. Sheller and their colleagues <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib117" title="" class="ltx_ref">117</a>]</cite> deployed a FL scheme to facilitate multi-institutional collaborations without the need to share patients’ data. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib118" title="" class="ltx_ref">118</a>]</cite>, MR data from multiple institutions is shared with privacy preservation. Moreover, cross-site modeling for MR image reconstruction is introduced to reduce domain shift and improve the generalization of the FL model. Moving on,
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib119" title="" class="ltx_ref">119</a>]</cite> combined differential privacy and weakly-supervised attention multiple instance learning (WS-AMIL) in order to develop a privacy-preserving FL approach for gigapixel whole slide images in computational pathology. Researchers in
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib120" title="" class="ltx_ref">120</a>]</cite> implemented differential-privacy schemes for protecting patients’ data in a FL setup designed for brain tumour segmentation on the BraTS dataset. In the same field, Bercea et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib121" title="" class="ltx_ref">121</a>]</cite> developed a disentangled FL approach to segment brain pathologies in an unsupervised mode. Cetinkaya et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib122" title="" class="ltx_ref">122</a>]</cite> attempted to improve the performance of FL-based medical image analysis in non IID settings using image augmentation.</p>

<p id="S3.SS5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The schemes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib123" title="" class="ltx_ref">123</a>, <a href="#bib.bib124" title="" class="ltx_ref">124</a>, <a href="#bib.bib125" title="" class="ltx_ref">125</a>]</cite> consider whether the necessity of watermarking is required when using FL. For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib123" title="" class="ltx_ref">123</a>]</cite> introduced a FL-based zero-watermarking technique for security and privacy preservation in teledermatology healthcare frameworks. FL-based autoencoder is employed for extracting image features from dermatology data using two-dimensional discrete cosine transform (2D-DCT). Conversely, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib124" title="" class="ltx_ref">124</a>, <a href="#bib.bib125" title="" class="ltx_ref">125</a>]</cite> are two strategies proposed for watermarking-based FL. The first is called WAFFLE proposed to prevent global FL model theft by offering a mechanism for model owners to showcase their ownership of the models, and the second is a client-side backdoor-triggered watermarking is adopted to secure FL model verification. Blockchain is also another means used for data privacy, Polap et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib126" title="" class="ltx_ref">126</a>]</cite> developed an intelligent medical system based on agent architecture using blockchain and FL technologies. Since FL algorithms do not inherently contain privacy-preserving mechanisms and can be sensitive to privacy-centered attacks that can divulge patients’ data, it is important to augment them with privacy-enhancing technologies, especially in clinical applications that are implemented in a multi-institutional setting. In this context, a differentially private FL solution is suggested by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib127" title="" class="ltx_ref">127</a>]</cite> to segment multi-site medical images in order to further enhance privacy against attacks. Besides, Guo et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib128" title="" class="ltx_ref">128</a>]</cite> propose an FL-based approach for distributed data in medical cyber-physical systems. Their approach helps in training DL models for disease diagnosis following three steps which are repeated in cycle: i) training a global model using offline medical images and transferring the global model to the local diagnosis nodes, ii) re-training the local models using local data and iii) sending them back to the central server for federated averaging. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib129" title="" class="ltx_ref">129</a>]</cite> propose a technique to harmonize local and global drifts in FL models on heterogeneous medical images.
In doing so, the local update drift is first mitigated by normalizing amplitudes of images transformed into the frequency domain and then a client weight perturbation guiding each local model to reach a flat optimum is designed based on harmonized features.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS5.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The problem setting of federated domain generalization (FedDG) is solved in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib130" title="" class="ltx_ref">130</a>]</cite>. This helps in learning a FL architecture from various distributed SDs, which enables its generalization to unseen TDs. This was made possible by introducing a the episodic learning in continuous frequency space (ELCFS) technique. Moving on, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib131" title="" class="ltx_ref">131</a>]</cite> propose a partial initialization-based cross-domain personalized FL, namely PartialFed. Their method is based on loading a subset of the global model’s parameters instead of loading the entire model, as it is done in most of the FL approaches. Thus, it is closer to the split Learning paradigm. More over, Wang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib132" title="" class="ltx_ref">132</a>]</cite> design an effective communication, and computation efficient FL scheme using progressive training. This helps to reduce computation and two-way communication costs, while preserving almost the same performance of the final models. While FL allows collaboratively training, using a joint model that is trained in multiple medical centers that maintain their data decentralized to preserve privacy, the federated optimizations face the heterogeneity and non-uniformity of data distribution across medical centers. To overcome this issue, an FL scheme with shared label distribution, namely FedSLD, is proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib133" title="" class="ltx_ref">133</a>]</cite>. This approach can reduce the discrepancy brought by data heterogeneity and adjust the contribution of every sample to the local objective during optimization via the knowledge of clients’ label distributions.

<div id="S3.SS6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Autonomous driving has recently received increasing interest due to the advance of CV, which is in the core of this technology. Vehicles leverage object detectors to analyze images collected by multiple sensors and cameras, analyze their surroundings in real-time and then recognize different objects, including other vehicles, road signs, barriers, pedestrians, etc., which help them in safely navigating the roads.
While a plethora of studies have focused on improving the accuracy by training DL algorithms on centralized large-scale datasets, few of them have addressed the users’ privacy. To that end, using FL in autonomous driving has recently attracted increasing attention. However, numerous challenges have been raised, including data discrepancy across clients and the server, expensive communication, systems heterogeneity and privacy concerns. Typically, privacy issues include internal and external data, such as the faces of pedestrians, vehicles’ positions, etc.</p>

<p id="S3.SS6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The approach to on-device ML using FL and validates it through a case study on wheel steering angle prediction for autonomous driving vehicles is presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib135" title="" class="ltx_ref">135</a>]</cite>. The results show that FL can significantly improve the quality of local edge models and reach the same accuracy level as centralized ML without negative effects. FL can also accelerate model training speed and reduce communication overhead, making it useful for deploying ML/DL components to various embedded systems.

<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib136" title="" class="ltx_ref">136</a>]</cite> propose a communication-efficient FL to detect fatigue driving behaviors, namely FedSup. It helps in progressively optimizing the sharing model with tailored client–edge–cloud architecture and reduces communication overhead by a Bayesian convolutional neural network (BCNN) data selection strategy. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib136" title="" class="ltx_ref">136</a>]</cite>, a federated autonomous driving network (FADNet) solution is introduced for enhancing models’ stability, ensuring convergence, and handling imbalanced data distribution problems where FL models are trained.</p>

A two-layer FL model is proposed that utilizes the distributed end-edge-cloud architecture to achieve more efficient and accurate learning while ensuring data privacy protection and reducing communication overhead. A novel multi-layer heterogeneous model selection and aggregation scheme is designed to better utilize the local and global contexts of individual vehicles and roadside units (RSUs) in 6 G-supported vehicular networks. This context-aware distributed learning mechanism is then applied to address intelligent object detection in modern intelligent transportation systems with autonomous vehicles.

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The advances in CV algorithms have increased the number and variety of tasks that range from the detection and tracking of specific objects in static images or controlled image streams to public surveillance and the detection of normal or abnormal behaviors and conditions in the wild, with applications from agricultural crop monitoring to law enforcement and medical diagnostics. The information captured in surveillance cameras’ footage may contain sensitive and private data that must be protected (e.g., the presence of individuals at a place), the CV models trained to detect abnormal behaviors in public may suffer from race, ethnicity or gender bias, and scene perception software in self-driving cars may suffer from the ability to adapt to new environments or conditions (e.g. fog, mist or haze).</p>

<div id="S4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">FL is a new method for protecting privacy when developing a DNN model, that uses data from various clients and trains a common model for all clients. This is achieved by fusing distributed ML, encryption and security, and introducing incentive mechanisms based on game theory and economic theory. FL could therefore serve as the cornerstone of next-generation ML that meets societal and technological requirements for ethical AI development and implementation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Despite their many advantages, FL solutions also have several challenges to address. First of all, since FL is a distributed learning technique it is important to guarantee the efficient communication between the federated network nodes so that they can communicate the learned model parameters. In addition to this, the models may be trained on nodes of different hardware architecture and capabilities (e.g. IoT devices, smartphones, etc.) which constitute a heterogeneous environment for FL. Consequently, it is important to establish the mechanisms that manage heterogeneous nodes in the same network, considering their restrictions and capabilities. The use of central (cloud-based) nodes that carry part of the training process, either using additional training data or by training parts of the learning model (e.g. some layers of the DNN as in the split learning paradigm) can be beneficial for the overall performance. A third issue that must be considered is the statistical heterogeneity of data that arrives in each node. Learning using non-IID data is still an open challenge for FL algorithms, and various alternatives are still under evaluation. Finally, privacy and robustness concerns are still present and methods that preserve privacy and at the same time guarantee the resulting model robustness to any kind of breaches or attacks must be properly designed and developed.</p>

<div id="S4.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A crucial component of a FL environment is communication between the client nodes and the central server. The ML model is downloaded, uploaded, and trained over the course of several communication rounds. Although transferring models instead of training datasets is significantly more efficient, these communication rounds may be delayed when the device has limited bandwidth, energy, or power. The communication overhead also increases when multiple client devices participate in each communication round thus leading to a bottleneck. Further delays may occur from the need to synchronise the receipt of models from all clients, including those with low bandwidth or unstable connections. An additional burden to the client synchronization overhead can be caused by the non-identical distribution of training data to the nodes, which may delay the training of some models, and consequently the model update process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib144" title="" class="ltx_ref">144</a>]</cite>.
This delay in cybersecurity can be considered an intrusion if it surpasses a predetermined threshold <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In order to mitigate the communication overhead and establish communication-efficient federation strategies, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib145" title="" class="ltx_ref">145</a>]</cite> have proposed the compression of transferred data. In a different approach, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib146" title="" class="ltx_ref">146</a>]</cite> have focused on identifying irrelevant models and precluding them from the aggregation, thus significantly reducing the communication cost. This is achieved by sharing the global tendency of model updating between the central server and all the client nodes and asking each client to align its update with this tendency before communicating the model.</p>

<div id="S4.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">

For this reason, it is important to consider the time needed for this process, including local training, model transmission, consensus, and block mining.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S4.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One of the major challenges in FL is the heterogeneity of data on different clients, which can hinder effective training. To address this issue, client selection strategies are often used in an attempt to improve the convergence rate of the FL process. While active client selection strategies have been proposed in recent studies, they do not take into account the loss correlations between clients and only offer limited improvement compared to a uniform selection strategy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib147" title="" class="ltx_ref">147</a>]</cite>. To overcome this limitation, FedCor, an FL framework that utilizes a correlation-based client selection strategy to improve the convergence rate of FL is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib148" title="" class="ltx_ref">148</a>]</cite>. The loss correlations between clients is modeled using a Gaussian process (GP) and use this model to select clients in a way that significantly reduces the expected global loss in each round. Moreover, an efficient GP training method is developed with low communication overhead for use in the FL scenario by leveraging the covariance stationarity. The experimental results show that FedCor can improve convergence rates by 34% to 99% on FMNIST and 26% to 51% on CIFAR-10 compared to the SOTA method.
Besides, FL still suffers from significant challenges such as the lack of convergence and the possibility of catastrophic forgetting.
However, it is demonstrated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib149" title="" class="ltx_ref">149</a>]</cite> that the self-attention-based architectures (e.g., Transformers) have shown to be more resistant to changes in data distribution and therefore can improve the effectiveness of FL on heterogeneous devices.
The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib150" title="" class="ltx_ref">150</a>]</cite> propose an alternative approach, called FedAlign, which aims to address data heterogeneity by focusing on local learning rather than proximal restriction. They conducted a study using second-order indicators to evaluate the effectiveness of different algorithms in FL and found that standard regularization methods performed well in mitigating the effects of data heterogeneity. FedAlign was found to be a simple and effective method for overcoming data heterogeneity, with competitive accuracy compared to SOTA FL methods and minimal computational and memory overhead.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, when FL is limited only to client nodes that share the same model architecture then the FedAvg algorithm and its alternatives (e.g. FedSDG, FedProx, etc.) can be applied to merge the locally trained models in each iteration <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib151" title="" class="ltx_ref">151</a>]</cite>. However, such approaches assume that the underlying nodes share similar hardware architecture, specifications and processing capabilities in general, which is not always the case in FL settings. For example, when smartphones, monitoring cameras and field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) attached cameras are orchestrated in an FL setting, the models have heterogeneous architectures and model parameter sharing is infeasible <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib152" title="" class="ltx_ref">152</a>, <a href="#bib.bib153" title="" class="ltx_ref">153</a>]</cite>. The barriers of conventional FL are removed when the models share their models instead of their parameters or updates. Algorithms such as the federated model distillation (FedMD) propose a model agnostic federation solution, which sends the predictions of the local models to the central node instead of the models themselves <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib154" title="" class="ltx_ref">154</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Another impact of node heterogeneity applies to the overall performance of the FL process since the federation of heterogeneous nodes with varying training data structure and size and varying processing capabilities usually requires in each round all the local nodes to train their models before proceeding to the next iteration. As a result, slow nodes, with low usability data may degrade the time performance of the federation. The work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib155" title="" class="ltx_ref">155</a>]</cite> proposes a reinforcement learning-based central server, which gradually weights the clients based on the quality of their models and their overall response in an attempt to establish a group of clients that are used to achieve almost optimal performance.</p>

Numerous studies have shown that the accuracy of FL on non-IID or heterogeneous data would inevitably deteriorate, mainly because of the divergence in the weights of local models that result from non-IID data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib156" title="" class="ltx_ref">156</a>]</cite>. Either the FL approach is horizontal (i.e. aggregating the local models’ weights on a central server) or vertical (i.e. aggregating the model outputs in the guest client to calculate the loss function) the non-IID data can take various forms (e.g. attribute, label or temporal skew) that can affect the overall performance, and mitigation measures must be taken to avoid it <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib157" title="" class="ltx_ref">157</a>]</cite>. These include data sharing and augmentation, and the fine-tuning of local models using a combination of local and global information. Wang wt al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib158" title="" class="ltx_ref">158</a>]</cite> propose FAVOR, a reinforcement-based method (deep Q-learning) for choosing the clients that contribute models to the aggregation phase in each round. The proposed method reduces the non-IID data bias and the communication overhead. Since the number of dimensions of the state space equals the number of model weights times the number of client nodes, a dimensionality reduction technique, such as PCA, is applied in order to compress the state space. Another group of approaches tries to balance the bias of non-IID data by clustering the local updates using a hierarchical algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib159" title="" class="ltx_ref">159</a>]</cite>. Such approaches result in multiple models that are trained independently and in parallel, leading to a faster and better convergence of each group.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FL relies on the participation of multiple devices, which may have different hardware and software configurations.

FL requires a stable and reliable network connection in order to train the model and exchange model updates between participants and the central server. If the network connection is unreliable or has low bandwidth, this can negatively impact the training process and the performance of the model.
Explicitly, if the parties involved in FL are located in different geographical regions, the time it takes for model updates to be transmitted over the network can vary significantly, leading to delays in the training process.</p>

<p id="S4.SS6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The resilience and data privacy of existing FL protocol designs have been shown to be compromised by adversaries both inside and outside the system. The sharing of gradients during training can reveal private information and cause data leakage to the central server or a third party. Similarly, malicious users can try to affect the global model by introducing poisoned local data or gradients (model poisoning) in an attempt to destroy its convergence (i.e. Byzantine attack) or to implant a trigger in the model that constantly predicts adversarial classes, without losing performance on the main task. These two times of attacks either aim to breach user privacy (e.g. infer class representatives, infer class membership or infer user properties) or poison the model in order to control its behavior <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib162" title="" class="ltx_ref">162</a>]</cite>.
Homomorphic encryption, secure joint computation from multiple parties, and differential privacy are some of the means for mitigating privacy breaches. Respectively, the defenses against poisoning attacks focus on the detection of malicious users based on the anomalies detected in their models (e.g. different distributions of features than the rest of the users <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib163" title="" class="ltx_ref">163</a>]</cite>) focusing on increasing the robustness against Byzantine attacks. They also examine the resulting models to detect whether they are compromised or not, using a combination of backdoor-enabled and clean inputs and examining the behavior of the model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib164" title="" class="ltx_ref">164</a>]</cite>.</p>

The FL blockchain, or FLchain for short, paradigm can transform mobile-edge computing to a secure and privacy-preserving system, once the proper solutions are found for allocating resources, providing incentives to the client nodes, and protecting the security and privacy of data at an optimal communication cost.
In their proposed architecture, the mobile-edge computing (MEC) servers can act either as learning clients or as miners to establish blockchain consensus and the mobile devices associated with each server focus only on the learning tasks. The mobile devices transmit their models to the MEC server as transaction. Each MEC server stores the local models it collects to the blockchain after verifying them with other MEC servers. The aggregation node or any other local node is then able to retrieve the stored and verified models from the blockchain, aggregate them and use the resulting model in the next iteration <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>.

Additionally, three main taks of CV, including image object detection, image segmentation and image classification can be evaluated on this toolkit, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F13" title="Figure 13 ‣ IV-G Replication of research results ‣ IV Open issues ‣ Federated Learning for Computer Vision" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">13</span></a>.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FL is a promising approach for solving privacy and data distribution challenges in CV tasks such as object detection, autonomous vehicles, etc. However, there are several challenges associated with the use of FL in these applications. For instance, FL assumes that the data distribution across clients is similar. However, in CV tasks, the data may be heterogeneous, and the models need to be robust to handle variations in lighting, viewpoint, and occlusions. FL relies on communication between clients and the server. For CV tasks, such as object detection, the models can be large, and the communication costs can be high. This can result in slower training times and higher energy consumption.
Moreover, CV tasks require labeled data for training the models while FL requires each client to have labeled data, which can be challenging in scenarios where labeling data is expensive or time-consuming.
Additionally, FL requires clients to share their data with the server, which can raise privacy and security concerns. Malicious clients can manipulate the data or models, compromising the integrity of the system.
Lastly, FL requires aggregating the models from multiple clients to produce a global model. In CV tasks, this can be challenging due to differences in the quality of the models and the data distribution across clients.</p>

<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, FedCV <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib166" title="" class="ltx_ref">166</a>]</cite> is a benchmarking framework for the evaluation of FL in popular CV tasks such as image classification and segmentation and object detection. It comprises non-IID datasets and various models and algorithms for experimentation. The experiments validate the aforementioned open challenges for FL in CV tasks: i) the degradation of model accuracy when non-IID data are used, ii) the complexity of optimising the training in the FL setting, iii) the huge number of parameters of NN models used in CV that affects the FL performance. The same benchmark can be employed to validate all the remaining issues discussed in this section, such as the node and data heterogeneity, the need for robustness and privacy etc.</p>

Since the platform is generic, it allows users to configure the learning parameters, schedule the communication between the server and clients, allocate tasks and monitor the utilization of resources. The main challenges mentioned in this section for FL also apply in the case of FedVision, which however chooses specific strategies to tackle them. For example, it uses model compression to reduce communication overhead, cloud object storage to store huge amounts of data (model parameters) in the server, and an one-stage approach, based on YOLOv3, to perform end-to-end training of the model that identifies the bounding box and the class of the object. However, the real challenges for FL approaches in CV come with the application in real-world images from surveillance cameras, etc. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib167" title="" class="ltx_ref">167</a>]</cite>. The large-scale of data collected and the requirement for almost real-time inference raises more design challenges for FL experts.</p>

In this direction, FL can be used to support such tasks without exposing private information. On the other side, IoT networks combine wearables, mobile and stable sensors, and smartphones in order to establish smart environments for the end users. All these constitute a diverse and heterogeneous environment in which models of varying complexity have to be communicated in the place of data in order to implement federation while protecting data privacy.</p>

This is due to the fact that federated networks may contain a sizable number of devices (such as millions of smartphones), and communication throughout the network may be much slower than local computing. Reducing the overall number of communication rounds or the quantity of communicated messages at each round are the two main ways to further cut communication. The communication can be more efficient using: i) Local updating techniques that allow to cut down the overall communication rounds, ii) model compression techniques including quantization, subsampling, and sparsification can be used to reduce the size of messages conveyed during each update round, iii) when the connection with the server becomes a bottleneck, decentralized topologies provide an alternative, particularly when working in networks with low bandwidth or excessive latency. Iterative optimization algorithms are parallelized using asynchronous communication. An appealing strategy for reducing stragglers in heterogeneous contexts is the use of asynchronous systems. Moreover, using 5G/6G networks will offer significantly higher speeds and lower latency compared to previous generations. This can enable faster and more efficient FL in CV applications.</p>

Dispersed FL can be used as a more robust alternative to FL, with groups of nodes with a lot of computing power to collaborate in more sub-global iterations to increase their performance and consequently support the overall performance of the federation.</p>
