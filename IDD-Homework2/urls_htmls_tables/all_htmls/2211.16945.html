<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Cell-free massive MIMO (CF mMIMO) is a promising next generation wireless architecture to realize federated learning (FL). However, sensitive information of user equipments (UEs) may be exposed to the involved access points or the central processing unit in practice. To guarantee data privacy, effective privacy-preserving mechanisms are defined in this paper. In particular, we demonstrate and characterize the possibility in exploiting the inherent quantization error, caused by low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and digital-to-analog converters (DACs), for privacy-preserving in a FL CF mMIMO system.
Furthermore, to reduce the required uplink training time in such a system, a stochastic non-convex design problem <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">that jointly optimizing the transmit power and the data rate is formulated.</span>
To address the problem at hand, we propose a novel power control method by utilizing the successive convex approximation approach to obtain a suboptimal solution.
Besides, an asynchronous protocol is established for mitigating the straggler effect to facilitate FL.
Numerical results show that compared with the conventional full power transmission, adopting the proposed power control method can effectively reduce the uplink training time under various practical system settings.
Also, our results unveil that our proposed asynchronous approach can reduce the waiting time at the central processing unit for receiving all user information, as there are no stragglers that requires a long time to report their local updates.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is an unprecedented technique to increase both the spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) of communication systems.
As a result, massive MIMO has already been utilized in practical cellular systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
However, some serious concerns have recently been raised about data privacy.
Indeed, mobile devices nowadays are often equipped with high computing capabilities enabling them to collect and process large amounts of data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
Specifically, numerous applications perform data preprocessing and classification for predicting possible future events via using various machine learning technologies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
The vast amount of data of devices is generally collected for numerous private applications carrying sensation information and thus naturally causes privacy concerns.
On the other hand, it is generally challenging to transmit all the data to a central processing unit (CPU) for training a deep learning model. Besides, due to the limited resources of wireless systems, sending a large amount of data through wireless link is not always possible as it would introduce expensive communication costs and exceedingly long communication delays.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to address the above challenges, it is necessary to design a novel machine learning (ML) technology such that each user equipment (UE) can be trained locally based on the data it collects and collaboratively establish a shared global learning model.
One of the most promising decentralized learning methods to achieve this goal is FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
In particular, multiple UEs are allowed to jointly train a global ML model without having to exchange raw data among them or transfer their data to the CPU <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
Specifically, the CPU first broadcasts the latest global model to all the participating UEs.
Next, the UEs calculate the corresponding local update based on the available data and then send their local models back to the CPU.
Repeat these steps until a certain level of global model accuracy is reached.
In this way, only local model parameters are exchanged, thereby reducing the required communication signaling overhead.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Despite raw data sharing wireless channel can be avoided via FL, UEs’ sensitive information can still be possibly revealed through any form of the leaked information.
For example, a malicious CPU can perform a model inversion attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> to infer the presence of individual data samples.
Moreover, other adversaries can apply differential attacks to the wireless communication phase that performs data exchanged between the CPU and distributed access points (APs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. In the literature, there are three popular techniques for maintaining privacy, including anonymization, data encryption and differential privacy (DP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, with different drawback. For instance, anonymization strategies do not guarantee complete level of protection from adversaries; cryptographic techniques are computationally expensive. In contrast, differential privacy is easy to implement and provides provable privacy guarantee.
Specifically, DP prevents the sensitive information of UEs from being easily exposed even if the CPU/adversaries can access the model parameters and acquire the knowledge of the adopted training mechanism <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.
In fact, one appealing approach to realize DP is via dedicated noise injection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
The main idea of this approach is to deliberately introduce some noises to the uploaded local model updates such that the CPU/adversaries cannot infer any sensitive information from exploiting the actual data.
Recently, remarkable efforts have been made to investigate DP mechanisms for wireless FL through artificial noise injection.
For instance, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, Gaussian noise was added to the local updated data and the power control was applied to realize different levels of DP protection.
Besides, the results in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> showed that the inherent channel noise can be exploited for guaranteeing DP FL.
Indeed, by deploying a proper power control, one can harness the channel noise to achieve privacy for free.
Also, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, the inherent hardware-induced distortion was exploited to facilitate local model updates and a power allocation strategy was proposed to provide guaranteed DP.
On the other hand, the existence of straggler effect also creates a bottleneck in realizing effective FL in wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
By definition, the CPU needs to wait until it receives training updates from all UEs before processing any next steps.
Therefore, some straggler UEs with unfavorable links may greatly slow down the entire FL process and reduce its practicality <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">All the aforementioned works, e.g. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, only assume simple wireless environments, e.g. Gaussian channels with additive white noise, which does not consider the fluctuation of practical wireless channels.
Also, in practice, when the number of UEs increases, the required training time could be significantly prolonged.
In such scenarios, to serve a large number of UEs via the same time/frequency resources, cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF mMIMO) systems have been applied for supporting FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.
Herein, multiple distributed APs are connected to the CPU through capacity-unlimited fronthaul links to serve UEs coherently.
Since the large number of APs can provide a rich macro-diversity gain for ensuring uniform received power strength, the performance of CF mMIMO supported FL is less prone to UEs with weak communication links.
However, the current literature focuses on cell-free massive MIMO systems implemented with federate learning is still limited.
A scheme for CF mMIMO networks to support any FL framework was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> for the first time. An optimization problem was also formulated to jointly optimize the local accuracy, transmit power, data rate, and users¡¯ processing frequency, and is solved by employing the online successive convex approximation approach.
Also, a UE selection approach was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> to mitigate the straggler effect with UE sampling for FL in CF mMIMO networks. It selects only a small subset of UEs for participating in one FL process.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, a novel scheme that asynchronously executes the iterations of FL processes was designed for multicasting downlink and conventional uplink transmission protocols.
However, the privacy-preserving is not considered in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, the authors developed and analyzed a privacy-preserving channel estimation schemes in CF mMIMO systems.
Yet, the design in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> only provides the data privacy protection during the channel estimation phase, therefore the data information transmitted by the UE in the payload data transmission phase still with high potential of leakage.
Besides, practical digital CF mMIMO communication systems adopt low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and digital-to-analog converters (DACs) to reduce associated power consumption and hardware cost <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. In fact, these inherent noise can be exploited to enhance DP that is somewhat overlooked in the literature.</p>

<div id="S1.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Motivated by the above discussion, we consider a practical CF mMIMO supported FL framework and demonstrate that the inherent quantization noise caused by low-resolution ADCs and DACs in CF mMIMO can be exploited as a useful privacy-preserving mechanism. Our contributions are listed as follows:</p>

<div id="S1.I1.i1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">First, we capitalize the quantization noise introduced by the low-resolution ADCs and DACs to prevent the CPU/adversaries from exploiting the actual local gradient updates to infer sensitive information and hence, realize privacy-preserving. Within this proposed framework, we derive an upper-bound to characterize the privacy violation probability and adopt it for formulating a privacy preservation condition.</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i2.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.I1.i2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Then, we provide the closed-from convergence analysis of the DP mechanism, taking into account the quantization noise, the length of the local updates, and the total data size. It can be observed from the upper bound of the average optimality gap that the noise added in the initial iterations is less damaging to the final optimality gap than that added in later iterations. Besides, the initial optimality gap decays geometrically as the number of iteration increases.
Note that the quantization noise is exploited for privacy protection, therefore, different quantization accuracies can realize different DP protection levels.</span></p>

Our numerical results reveal that the proposed power control method can effectively reduce the uplink training time under different privacy protection levels. Besides, our power control method still performs well over various baseline schemes for different number of APs and UEs.</span></p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, an optimization problem is formulated to jointly optimize the transmit power and data rate under the practical constraints on UEs¡¯ energy consumption with different quantization accuracies of the ADCs/DACs. Note that the quantization noise is used for privacy protection, therefore, different quantization accuracies realizes different DP protection levels. By applying the successive convex approximation approach, we design a computationally-efficient algorithm to obtain a suboptimal solution of the power allocation. Besides, we propose an asynchronous FL protocol to alleviate the staleness, efficiency and better utilize the progress made by stragglers.</p>

As a result, it can be solved by convex optimization. Besides, we can further tighten the bounds in (48) iteratively, which is suboptimal in Algorithm 1. Note that the proposed algorithm can achieve a suboptimal solution of (48) and the corresponding convergence can be proved via a similar approach in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.

For the former, the CPU should wait until getting response from sufficient UEs. Unfortunately, some UEs may be unresponsive in the training process due to vulnerable wireless network. Then, the CPU drops such UEs and proceeds on to the next training process. On the contrary, asynchronous FL enables all UEs to directly send update information to the CPU after every local round that is dropped in synchronous FL optimization. In general, asynchronous FL can achieve faster convergence when wireless links are vulnerable and heterogeneous across the UEs. Therefore, asynchronous FL has drawn more interests in recent papers.</span></p>

Therefore, we propose a simple asynchronous FL protocol based on the large-scale fading coefficient. Specifically, a lag-tolerant algorithm which allows some UEs to stay asynchronous with the CPU is provided.
Note that straggler UEs refer to UEs that are slower and are still training locally based on outdated models. Generally, the UE should start training based on the latest global model received from the CPU.</p>

Then, since the channel gains of straggler UEs are not strong enough, they may dramatically slow down the whole FL process. In order to mitigate the straggler effect, the local training of straggler UEs are still based on the last version of the global model. Therefore, the straggler UEs are also called asynchronous UEs.

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we first evaluate the performance of the proposed power control algorithm under different DP protection levels in the CF mMIMO supported FL network. Note that the DP mechanism is realized by the quantization noise. Therefore, we adopt ADCs and DACs with different quantization bits to achieve different DP protection levels.
<span id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">More specifically</span>, we adopt similar parameters setting as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.
Note that we do not propose a new FL framework but rather apply a existed FL framework in CF mMIMO systems. We focus on how to reduce the training time using different quantization bits or under differential privacy levels. Therefore, the simulation on real datasets to see the effectiveness of the considered FL framework has already performed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> and hence, they are not considered in this paper. <span id="S5.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Note that the unit of time is seconds in the following figures.</span></p>

As expected, the uplink training time first decreases along with the increase of the number of blocks, which is resulted from that data exchange is less often. Then, the uplink training time increases as the SE of UEs are declined. Besides, the efficiency of our power control method is obvious. When the number of blocks is 8, applying the proposed power control method leads to a 42% reduction in terms of uplink training time.</span></p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we studied the DP in wireless FL enabled by CF mMIMO systems with low-resolution ADCs and DACs. By introducing the quantization noise as the DP mechanism, we derived an expression of the privacy preservation condition and provided convergence analysis for the proposed model. Targeting at the uplink training time minimization, we jointly optimized the transmit power and data rate under different DP protection levels. The simulation results showed that our proposed power control method can effectively reduce the uplink training time in all considered cases. In order to mitigate the effect of straggler, we proposed an asynchronous FL protocol which incorporates a UE selection algorithm based on the large-scale fading coefficient decoupling the CPU and the selected UEs for a reduction of uplink training time and for tackling the tradeoff between faster convergence and lower communication overhead. <span id="S6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">To further improve the system performance, some future extensions can be considered, e.g., channel allocation.</span></p>
