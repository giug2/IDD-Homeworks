<p id="p6.2" class="ltx_p"><span id="p6.2.1" class="ltx_text" lang="en">This paper investigates mechanism design for decision-aware collaboration via federated learning (FL) platforms. Our framework consists of a digital platform and multiple decision-aware agents, each endowed with proprietary data sets. The platform offers an infrastructure that enables access to the proprietary data, creates incentives for collaborative learning aimed at operational decision-making, and conducts federated learning (FL) to avoid direct raw data sharing. The computation and communication efficiency of the FL process is inherently influenced by the agent participation equilibrium induced by the mechanism. Therefore, assessing the collaborative learning system’s efficiency involves two critical factors: the surplus created by coalition formation and the communication costs incurred across the coalition during FL. To evaluate the system efficiency under the intricate interplay between mechanism design, agent participation, operational decision-making, and the performance of FL algorithms, we introduce a multi-action collaborative federated learning (MCFL) framework for decision-aware agents. Under the MCFL framework, we further analyze the equilibrium for the renowned Shapley value based mechanisms. Specifically, we examine the issue of false-name manipulation, a form of dishonest behavior where participating agents create duplicate fake identities to split their original data among these identities. By solving the agent participation decisions in equilibrium, we demonstrate that, while Shapley value effectively maximizes coalition-generated surplus by encouraging full participation, it inadvertently promotes false-name manipulation. This further significantly increases the communication costs when the platform conducts federated learning across the coalition members. Thus, we highlight a significant pitfall of Shapley value based mechanisms, which implicitly incentivizes data splitting and identity duplication, ultimately impairing the overall efficiency in federated learning systems.</span></p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Digitalization has brought revolutionary changes across traditional sectors such as retail, finance, and healthcare, allowing companies to offer services via online platforms and thus highlighting the importance of data-driven approaches. Moreover, the advances in large-scale machine learning models underscore the necessity for collaboration in developing machine learning methods, where individuals and organizations unite, sharing their data for mutual advancement.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our framework models the collaborative learning system consisting of a platform and multiple decision-aware agents. The platform offers an infrastructure that enables access to each agent’s proprietary data set and coordinates the collaboration by incentivizing agent participation in collaborative learning through mechanism design. There are two main types of collaborative learning approaches: centralized learning, which involves training on a centralized machine; and federated learning, which is a decentralized approach with local training. Centralized learning involves raw data sharing, which is often less preferred due to privacy concerns <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(AbdulRahman et al. <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>, Choudhury <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>. In contrast, federated learning (FL) does not require any of the participants to reveal their raw data to the platform, safeguarding the privacy of local agents’ data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al. <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>. Therefore, FL techniques become prevailing for the platform to address privacy and safety concerns arising from the agents.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Normally, the decision-aware agents have their specific operational objectives when participating in collaborative federated learning. For example, the primary goal of sellers in e-commerce platforms is to make informed data-driven pricing or inventory decisions, rather than concentrating on purely statistical predictive objectives, as often assumed in prior research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al. <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>. Moreover, the decision-aware agents could choose how to participate in collaborative learning by partially contributing a subset of their datasets or splitting their datasets to participate under fake identities. This type of dishonest conduct is known as <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">false-name manipulation</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Conitzer and Yokoo <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>)</cite>. Hence, the platform must carefully design a mechanism to encourage full participation among the decision-aware agents with heterogeneous data volumes, while making the mechanism more robust to false-name manipulation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">It is worth emphasizing that, there is an intricate interplay between mechanism design, agent participation, operational decision-making, and the performance of FL algorithms, as described in the following questions:
<span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">1) how is the allocation mechanism designed based on performance guarantees of learning algorithms; 2) how a mechanism influences the agent participation equilibrium; and 3) how the computation and communication of the FL learning algorithm is influenced by the equilibrium. </span>
This complex interaction among these factors has been overlooked in existing studies, while prior research focusing on encouraging local agent participation often neglects its impact on algorithm performance, and studies aimed at improving FL algorithm efficiency and reducing communication costs tend to disregard the crucial role of mechanism design in improving algorithm performance.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">1.1 </span>A Motivating Example</h3>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One use of this scenario is the <span id="S1.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">customer-to-manufacturer</span> (C2M) initiative.
For online e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, FlipKart, Alibaba, and JD.com, products and services are provided by sellers/manufacturers to customers over such online platforms. These platforms’ digital infrastructure is the key to accessing a great amount of granular and precise data (e.g. search and clicks of products, customer reviews and ratings) compared to traditional brick-and-mortar retailers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Qi et al. <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>.
There is a clear incentive to leverage this data further up the supply chain, enabling sellers and manufacturers to make more informed decisions in planning and operations. In practice, platforms like Walmart have begun sharing these datasets with their sellers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Masters <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>, Arora and Jain <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The C2M paradigm aims to build digital connections between end consumers and upstream manufacturers, often through online retailing platforms, as has been witnessed at JD.com, Alibaba, and Pinduoduo (PDD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Mak and Max Shen <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. Therefore, many operational decisions, such as pricing, product design, and inventory management, are indispensable to the resources provided by these digital platforms and cannot be effectively managed by sellers or manufacturers alone. Furthermore, by aggregating the information potentially obtained from their individual data, sellers/manufacturers will significantly benefit from having a more refined and accurate data-driven decision. To assist sellers, the platform provides collaboration opportunities for them to form a coalition to aggregate their data for more informed decision-making <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Masters <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. Such a collaboration is essential for harnessing the full potential of digital transformation.</p>

The MCFL framework models the collaborative federated learning system by characterizing the mechanism designed by the platform, agent participation cooperative game, operational decision-making, and the performance of FL algorithms conducted within the formed coalition. This fills the gap in modeling all these key factors and investigating the complex interplay between them.</p>

We specifically investigate the widely recognized Shapley value-based mechanism, a prominent method in multi-agent collaborative learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Shapley et al. <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">1953</a>)</cite>. We further analyze the agent participation equilibrium considering the possible dishonest behavior - false-name manipulation. By solving the agent participation decisions in equilibrium, we demonstrate that the Shapley value is not robust against preventing false-name manipulation, which further impacts the performance of MCFL.</p>

We focus on the Federated Averaging algorithm (FedAvg) where the agents perform local training and the platform periodically collects interim results from each agent and synchronizes all agents. The communication cost, which occurs during the synchronization, is affected by the number of agent identities within the coalition. We demonstrate that, while Shapley value effectively maximizes coalition-generated surplus by encouraging full participation, it inadvertently promotes false-name manipulation. As a result, agents tend to participate with data split among fake identities, which further significantly increases the communication costs for performing FL across agents. This pitfall of Shaply value based mechanism ultimately reduces the system efficiency under the MCFL framework.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our paper is closely related to collaborations involving multiple agents. We model such collaboration as a cooperative game, which studies the coalitions formed by players and their cooperative actions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Branzei et al. (<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2008</a>)</cite>. A well-known allocation rule within this framework is based on the Shapley value <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Shapley et al. <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">1953</a>)</cite>, which allocates the payoffs to players based on their marginal contribution to each coalition she is a member of, ensuring a fair and efficient distribution. Although the Shapley value initially considers only binary participation actions of agents, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Hsiao and Raghavan (<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">1993</a>)</cite> extends the Shapley value to scenarios where agents have multiple actions. Building on these works, we present a multi-action collaborative federated learning (MCFL) framework and summarize the related literature below.</p>

<p id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Shapley value is extensively used to incentivize collaboration among decision-aware agents with specific operational objectives. This topic is heavily studied in the field of operations management, where agents typically operate within distinct business contexts. Specifically, in supply chain management, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Leng and Parlar (<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2009</a>)</cite> explores the Shapley value for distributing surplus generated from shared demand information among a manufacturer, a distributor, and a retailer. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Kemahlıoğlu-Ziya and Bartholdi III (<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>)</cite> applies the Shapley mechanism for allocating surplus generated from inventory pooling among retailers. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Gopalakrishnan et al.

<p id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning approach where a model is trained across multiple decentralized agents holding local data samples, without exchanging them, thus enhancing privacy and efficiency. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">McMahan et al.

We differ from this paper in the following aspects. Firstly, they assume specific exogenous functional forms of learning benefit and FL cost, while our work models the FL cost as an outcome of equilibrium participation, influenced by the mechanism. Secondly, we account for the decision-aware agents, where coalition surplus is also shaped by the operational decisions. More importantly, we address the potential for dishonest behaviors under the MCFL framework, such as data splitting and fake identity creation, which is not covered in prior research.</p>

<p id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To our knowledge, our paper is the first work that considers decision-aware collaborative learning through the FL approach, with an analysis of the impact of mechanism design on both the coalition surplus and FL efficiency. Specifically, we consider that in equilibrium, the agents may conduct dishonest behavior on false name manipulation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Iwasaki et al.

We show that, while a Shapley value based mechanism encourages agent full participation, it inadvertently promotes false-name manipulation, which hugely increases the FL training cost. This eventually leads to a pitfall of Shapley value under the MCFL framework.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">After forming a coalition, the platform aims to conduct collaborative learning that is privacy-preserving. One common approach is through Federated Learning (FL) frameworks, with a representative widely adopted algorithm known as Federated Averaging algorithm (FedAvg) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kairouz et al. <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. In FedAvg, agents keep their raw data locally to preserve privacy and perform local training on their own data. Periodically, the platform collects interim results from each agent and synchronizes all agents by distributing the average of these local outcomes. The details of the algorithm are provided in Section <a href="#S5" title="5 System Efficiency" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The uniqueness of Shapley value lies in that, it satisfies all the desired properties for an allocation mechanism. An ideal mechanism should (1) prevent free-riding from a non-contributing agent; (2) ensure equality of treatment for agents who contribute equally; (3) guarantee that the surplus is fully allocated without any waste; and (4) should be consistent and scalable across different situations. These desired properties could further be translated into the following axioms.</p>

However, when applied in the real world, Shapley value based mechanism can be vulnerable to dishonest behaviors or manipulations conducted by the participating agents.

We also discuss the potential vulnerability of Shapley value under dishonest behaviors like false-name manipulation. In this section, we elaborate on how false-name manipulation would impact the performance of FL algorithms. Our study is the first to study the impact of mechanism design on agents’ decisions to provide data, and how these decisions subsequently affect the performance of platform learning algorithms. We delve into how an efficient mechanism like Shapley, one that is budget-balanced and promotes complete data provision to enhance estimator quality, is vulnerable to false-name manipulation, which leads to agents participating with splitting their data. Such vulnerability could result in escalated communication costs within federated learning frameworks, presenting a complex challenge that intertwines mechanism design with operational efficiency.</p>

We first introduce the platform federated learning process and define the system efficiency that combines both the agent allocation of MCFL and the communication cost of federated learning. We then conduct an analysis of the system efficiency to Shapley value based mechanism. Our findings emphasize that although the Shapley mechanism adheres to the desired axioms of mechanism design, it fails to guard against false-name manipulation, resulting in considerably higher training costs compared to other mechanisms. This ultimately leads to the pitfall of Shapley mechanism.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In section 3, we show that the Shapley value based mechanism is the only mechanism that satisfies the desired properties of axioms and leads to efficient allocation with no extra surplus left on the table. In this section, we focus more on how the mechanism would impact the platform training process. Specifically, while false-name participation in data splitting would not negatively impact the estimator quality, as data splitting does not vary the total number of the observations, false-name participation would significantly increase the training cost to attain the performance guarantee, as it creates redundant communications and operations between the central platform and the fake identities of agents.</p>

It’s worth mentioning that, there is no free lunch in designing a mechanism that satisfies all the desired properties, while still being robust to false name manipulation and minimizing computation cost. As the previous result suggests, Shapley is the only mechanism that satisfies all the desired axioms, however, it is not robust enough to prevent data splitting. This implies that there is no optimal mechanism that satisfies the desired properties, while still minimizing the the communication cost in FL. In practice, the platform needs to carefully balance the trade-offs when designing the mechanism.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In conclusion, our study has shed light on the intricate dynamics of collaborative learning in multi-agent systems through the lens of Federated Learning (FL) technology and Shapley value-based mechanisms. By establishing a comprehensive framework, we have underscored the critical role of platform-facilitated collaboration among decision-aware agents and delved into the nuanced impacts of mechanism design on both decision quality and FL algorithm efficiency.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our investigation reveals that while Shapley value based mechanism ensures fair allocation and guarantees quality decisions among agents through encouraging full participation, they inadvertently introduce significant communication costs during the FL process due to the agents’ dishonest behavior of false-name manipulation, highlighting a crucial trade-off between decision quality and operational efficiency. This discovery not only addresses a gap in existing research but also opens new avenues for exploring mechanism design that balances decision quality with the practicalities of implementation in FL environments.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, our work stands as a pioneering effort to systematically explore the interplay between mechanism design and FL performance, offering valuable insights for both theoreticians and practitioners interested in optimizing collaborative learning settings. The identification of Shapley value mechanisms’ limitations further enriches the studies in collaborative learning, prompting a reevaluation of widely accepted practices and encouraging the development of more efficient, cost-effective solutions. Several future promising directions involve investigating other mechanisms beyond Shapley value and analyzing this framework under more specific business or operations contexts, including pricing, and inventory management, to name a few.</p>
