<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Over-the-air federated learning (AirFL) allows devices to train a learning model in parallel and synchronize their local models using over-the-air computation.
The integrity of AirFL is vulnerable due to the obscurity of the local models aggregated over-the-air.
This paper presents a novel framework to balance the accuracy and integrity of AirFL, where multi-antenna devices and base station (BS) are jointly optimized with a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS).
The key contributions include a new and non-trivial problem jointly considering the model accuracy and integrity of AirFL, and a new framework that transforms the problem into tractable subproblems.
Under perfect channel state information (CSI), the new framework minimizes the aggregated model’s distortion and retains the local models’ recoverability by optimizing the transmit beamformers of the devices, the receive beamformers of the BS, and the RIS configuration in an alternating manner.
Under imperfect CSI, the new framework delivers a robust design of the beamformers and RIS configuration to combat non-negligible channel estimation errors.
As corroborated experimentally, the novel framework can achieve comparable accuracy to the ideal FL while preserving local model recoverability under perfect CSI, and improve the accuracy when the number of receive antennas is small or moderate under imperfect CSI.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As a promising distributed machine learning (ML) framework, federated learning (FL) allows multiple workers to train a model in parallel based on their local datasets, thereby protecting the data privacy of the workers and accelerating the training  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
FL requires locally trained models to be aggregated periodically, to create the global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
Incorporating over-the-air computation (AirComp) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> into FL, over-the-air FL (AirFL) provides an efficient means to aggregate local models.
It allows the workers to upload their models using the same time-frequency resources, and obtain nomographic functions of the ML models directly by exploiting the superposition property of radio <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
AirFL is suitable for wireless networks, where many distributed devices act as workers and their serving base station (BS) is the model aggregator.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is an increasingly widely accepted technology, and is envisaged to be one of the promising enhancements for future wireless systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
The consideration of RISs is indispensable for a future-proof design of AirFL systems.
The deployment of an RIS ushers in a new degree of freedom to augment the radio propagation environment (in addition to the transmit and receive beamforming). The RIS can be configured to alleviate the distortion of the aggregated model by tuning the phase shifts of its reflecting elements <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
Compared to traditional multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) AirComp systems, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, the incorporation of an RIS confronts not only a new challenge of a different problem formulation with many more variables, but the unit-modulus constraints of the new variables and their coupling increase the complexity of the problem dramatically.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">A general challenge arising from general AirFL systems, including those with or without RIS, is the integrity of AirFL, as studied in our paper. The model integrity accounts collectively for the trustworthiness of the local models provided to the model aggregator, i.e., the BS, to produce the global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> and the accountability of the devices that produce the local models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. While enjoying the substantially reduced requirement of radio resources and thus enhanced scalability, AirFL obscures the local models at the BS and prevents the BS from assessing the trustworthiness of the local models. This makes AirFL vulnerable to model poisoning attacks.
Consider multi-antenna devices and BS, and an RIS comprising a large number of reconfigurable phase shifts. The optimization variables include the transmit beamformers of the devices, the receive beamformer of the BS, and the phase shifts of the RIS, and typically coupled. The optimization is generally non-convex and mathematically intractable, even when the perfect channel state information (CSI) is available <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.
Leave alone the typically imperfect CSI in practice <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
No existing study has considered the trustworthiness of the local models and the accountability of the devices producing the local models.</p>

Two trade-offs between the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and truncation, and between reliability and quantity, were revealed. Compared to conventional orthogonal transmissions, the communication latency was significantly reduced.
The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> proposed one-bit broadband digital aggregation to overcome the difficult deployment of analog modulation required by over-the-air aggregation, where the devices apply one-bit quantization to the stochastic gradient and the BS employs a majority-vote based decoder to estimate the aggregated gradient. Convergence analysis was carried out separately under channel noise, fading, and estimation errors.
The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> studied the transmit power control of AirFL to reduce the aggregation errors. A closed-form optimality gap was derived to capture the impact of aggregation errors on the convergence behavior. The training latency was minimized against a given optimality gap.</p>

Aiming to minimize the MSE of the received and aggregated signals, closed-form aggregate beamforming at the BS was designed by exploiting the low rank characteristics of the clustered channels. Two low-latency simultaneous channel feedback schemes were developed to retrieve a function of individual CSI in both disjoint and overlapping clusters.
The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> utilized AirComp to achieve efficient wireless data aggregation.
The beamforming matrices of multi-antenna devices and a multi-antenna BS were optimized by applying a differential geometry technique to minimize the mean square error (MSE) of the received signals.
The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> extended AirComp to FL systems for fast model aggregation, and maximized supportable devices by optimizing the receive beamforming vector with difference-of-convex-functions (DC) programming.

The selection and power allocation of the devices, the receive amplification of the BS, and the phase shifts of the RISs were jointly optimized to minimize the MSE and select as many devices as possible.
A non-convex bi-criterion problem was formulated and solved using alternating optimization (AO).
The MSE was minimized using semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and successive convex approximation (SCA).

The phase shifts of an RIS and the power allocation of the devices were optimized to minimize the total transmit power using block-coordinate descent.
These robust designs cannot directly apply to AirFL, because of distinct problems and settings.</p>

<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper presents a novel framework, which strikes a balance between accuracy and integrity for an AirFL system comprising multi-antenna devices and BS, and an RIS.
The key idea is that we propose to recover the local models serially using successive interference cancellation (SIC).
The BS dedicates one receive beamformer for model aggregation, and the other receive beamformer for recovering local models.
The two receive beamformers are jointly optimized with the transmit beamformers of the devices and the phase shifts of the RIS, to minimize the MSE of the model aggregation while maintaining sufficient power gaps between the local models for successful recovery.
Another important aspect is that we develop new iterative algorithms which decompose this non-convex joint optimization problem into tractable subproblems. AO is employed to orchestrate the DC and SCA methods for optimizing the beamformers and phase shifts, first under perfect CSI and then imperfect CSI.</p>

This framework can support dropout techniques typically used to reduce the size of the local models to be uploaded. For example, a federated dropout scheme was developed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> to prune a global model into multiple subsets with different dropout rates adapting to the different abilities of the devices. The federated dropout can be executed at the devices to prune their models before the pre-processing.</p>

The local models are recovered one after another by running SIC.
The SIC is typically performed in the digital baseband at the BS. Specifically, the analog signals superposed by AirComp are downconverted to the baseband and digitized before the SIC is carried out.
Considering the effectiveness of the model recovery, we take the convention of SIC that allows the devices with stronger channel gains to be decoded earlier and canceled, so on so forth until all devices are decoded <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>. This is because the large-scale path loss typically has a strong impact on the received signal strengths at the BS and, in turn, on the SIC order <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>. The BS determines the SIC orders based on the Frobenius norm of the channels of the devices under perfect CSI, i.e., <math id="S2.p11.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="{\|{\bf{H}}_{k}\|}^{2}_{F}" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.p11.3.m3.1a"><msubsup id="S2.p11.3.m3.1.1" xref="S2.p11.3.m3.1.1.cmml"><mrow id="S2.p11.3.m3.1.1.1.1.1" xref="S2.p11.3.m3.1.1.1.1.2.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S2.p11.3.m3.1.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S2.p11.3.m3.1.1.1.1.2.1.cmml">‖</mo><msub id="S2.p11.3.m3.1.1.1.1.1.1" xref="S2.p11.3.m3.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S2.p11.3.m3.1.1.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S2.p11.3.m3.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml">𝐇</mi><mi id="S2.p11.3.m3.1.1.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S2.p11.3.m3.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml">k</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false" id="S2.p11.3.m3.1.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S2.p11.3.m3.1.1.1.1.2.1.cmml">‖</mo></mrow><mi id="S2.p11.3.m3.1.1.3" xref="S2.p11.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml">F</mi><mn id="S2.p11.3.m3.1.1.1.3" xref="S2.p11.3.m3.1.1.1.3.cmml">2</mn></msubsup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.p11.3.m3.1b"><apply id="S2.p11.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p11.3.m3.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S2.p11.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S2.p11.3.m3.1.1">subscript</csymbol><apply id="S2.p11.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p11.3.m3.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S2.p11.3.m3.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S2.p11.3.m3.1.1">superscript</csymbol><apply id="S2.p11.3.m3.1.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S2.p11.3.m3.1.1.1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S2.p11.3.m3.1.1.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S2.p11.3.m3.1.1.1.1.1.2">norm</csymbol><apply id="S2.p11.3.m3.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p11.3.m3.1.1.1.1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S2.p11.3.m3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p11.3.m3.1.1.1.1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S2.p11.3.m3.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S2.p11.3.m3.1.1.1.1.1.1.2">𝐇</ci><ci id="S2.p11.3.m3.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S2.p11.3.m3.1.1.1.1.1.1.3">𝑘</ci></apply></apply><cn type="integer" id="S2.p11.3.m3.1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S2.p11.3.m3.1.1.1.3">2</cn></apply><ci id="S2.p11.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S2.p11.3.m3.1.1.3">𝐹</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.p11.3.m3.1c">{\|{\bf{H}}_{k}\|}^{2}_{F}</annotation></semantics></math>.

<p id="S3.p6.4" class="ltx_p">Consider that the loss function, e.g., the cross-entropy function <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>, decreases with the increase of the correct output probability of each training sample.
Reducing the MSE of the aggregated model helps decrease the loss function value <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.
In this sense, a smaller MSE is more likely to produce a higher accuracy of AirFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>.

Given the same structure of Algorithms 1 and 2, the complexity and convergence of Algorithm 2 can be analyzed in the same way as those of Algorithm 1 and suppressed for brevity.
The proposed algorithms, i.e., Algorithms 1 and 2, can be readily applied in the absence of the RIS by skipping the part solving the phase shifts, i.e., solving subproblems (<a href="#A3.EGx16" title="In III-D Phase Shift Matrix ‣ III Beamforming Design and RIS Configuration under Perfect CSI ‣ Balancing Accuracy and Integrity for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-aided Over-the-Air Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">33</span></a>) or (<a href="#A3.EGx34" title="In IV-A4 Phase Shift Matrix ‣ IV-A Robust Design under Imperfect CSI ‣ IV Robust Beamforming and RIS Configuration under Imperfect CSI ‣ Balancing Accuracy and Integrity for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-aided Over-the-Air Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">63</span></a>).</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we assess the proposed algorithms by conducting extensive experiments under a setting consistent with <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite> in which general RIS-aided systems were studied.
Our experiments involve synthetic wireless channels based on empirical channel fading models for AirComp, and the MNIST or Fashion-MNIST datasets. Both the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets have been extensively used to examine the classification performance of machine learning algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>, <a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>, <a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>]</cite>. The empirical channel fading models, i.e., the Rician or Rayleigh fading, have been extensively considered in numerical validations of wireless systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. The Gaussian estimation errors are considered under imperfect CSI, as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>. Nevertheless, the proposed algorithms are general, do not rely on the a-priori knowledge of the channel models, and are not restricted to particular channel models. The algorithms can be applied under other channel fading types.</p>

For this reason, no existing studies are directly comparable with the proposed Algorithms 1 and 2.
For comparison purpose, we plot the ideal FL, where the devices upload their local models separately and free of errors, and the BS aggregates the error-free local models to produce the global model which is then returned to the devices for continuing training.
The ideal FL can provide the upper bound for the classification accuracy of AirFL.</p>

On both the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, we see that the accuracies of the proposed algorithms slightly decline as the required minimum SINR increases, trading the accuracy for model integrity.
Under perfect CSI, increasing the transmit powers helps improve the trade-off by pushing the curves towards the top-right corner.
In contrast, the increased transmit power can be detrimental under imperfect CSI, resulting from the interference caused by the channel estimation errors.</p>

We consider two fading types for the device-BS channels, i.e., the Rician fading and Rayleigh fading.
We see that the MSE of the global model declines with the increase of receive antennas.
Under perfect CSI, the gain from employing the RIS is prominent, despite the gain diminishes with the increase of receive antennas under the Rician fading.
This is because a large number of receive antennas provides sufficient array gain, hence overshadowing the improvement brought by the RIS.
When the Rayleigh fading is considered, the MSE improvement of deploying the RIS is more significant due to the absence of the LoS.
Under imperfect CSI, the use of the RIS can slow down the decline of the MSE with the increase of receive antennas under the Rician fading, and get outperformed by not using the RIS when the number of receive antennas is large, i.e., <math id="S5.p7.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="N_{r}\geq 10" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p7.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S5.p7.2.m2.1.1" xref="S5.p7.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><msub id="S5.p7.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S5.p7.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml"><mi id="S5.p7.2.m2.1.1.2.2" xref="S5.p7.2.m2.1.1.2.2.cmml">N</mi><mi id="S5.p7.2.m2.1.1.2.3" xref="S5.p7.2.m2.1.1.2.3.cmml">r</mi></msub><mo id="S5.p7.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S5.p7.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">≥</mo><mn id="S5.p7.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S5.p7.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">10</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p7.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S5.p7.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p7.2.m2.1.1"><geq id="S5.p7.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p7.2.m2.1.1.1"></geq><apply id="S5.p7.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.p7.2.m2.1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.p7.2.m2.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S5.p7.2.m2.1.1.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.p7.2.m2.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S5.p7.2.m2.1.1.2.2">𝑁</ci><ci id="S5.p7.2.m2.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S5.p7.2.m2.1.1.2.3">𝑟</ci></apply><cn type="integer" id="S5.p7.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.p7.2.m2.1.1.3">10</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p7.2.m2.1c">N_{r}\geq 10</annotation></semantics></math>.
This is due to severer interference caused by the channel estimation errors in the presence of more receive antennas.
However, when the Rayleigh channel is considered, Algorithm 2 with the RIS can outperform the other considered scenarios. This confirms that the RIS is specifically desirable to improve the MSE when the LoS between the devices and the BS is blocked under imperfect CSI.</p>

Under perfect CSI, the RIS clearly contributes to the improvement of the accuracy.
However, the contribution decreases with the increase of receive antennas under the Rician fading, because the array gain of the BS increasingly dominates.

This is because of the increased interference resulting from the estimation errors of the RIS-reflected channels.
The conclusion drawn is that the RIS is beneficial for the accuracy of AirFL under the Rician fading and imperfect CSI, when the number of receive antennas is small or moderate.
Nevertheless, we also see that deploying the RIS achieves higher accuracies under the Rayleigh fading in Fig. <a href="#S5.F5.8" title="Figure 5 ‣ V Numerical and Experimental Results ‣ Balancing Accuracy and Integrity for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-aided Over-the-Air Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>(b).</p>

We see that the MSE of both algorithms decreases monotonically over iterations until converge.

Under imperfect CSI, we also run Algorithm 1 designed for perfect CSI, and show that Algorithm 2 can substantially outperform Algorithm 1.

This validates the robustness of Algorithm 2.
In contrast, Algorithm 1 designed for perfect CSI may fail to guarantee the required minimum SINR (or in other words, the recoverability of the local models), when the channel estimation errors are non-negligible under imperfect CSI.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed a new framework to balance the accuracy and integrity for AirFL by designing two receive beamformers at the BS for AirFL and local model recovery.
Under perfect CSI, we minimized the distortion of the aggregated model and retained the recoverability of the local models by optimizing the transmit and receive beamformers, and the RIS configuration in an alternating manner.
Under imperfect CSI, we extended the framework to deliver a robust design of the beamformers and RIS configuration.
Experiments showed that the framework achieves comparable learning accuracy and convergence to the ideal FL while preserving the local model recoverability under perfect CSI. Our framework also improves the accuracy when the number of receive antennas is small or moderate under imperfect CSI.</p>
