<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Batch normalization has proven to be a very beneficial mechanism to accelerate the training and improve the accuracy of deep neural networks in centralized environments. Yet, the scheme faces significant challenges in federated learning, especially under high data heterogeneity. Essentially, the main challenges arise from external covariate shifts and inconsistent statistics across clients.
We introduce in this paper Federated BatchNorm (FBN), a novel scheme that restores the benefits of batch normalization in federated learning.
Essentially, FBN ensures that the batch normalization during training is consistent with what would be achieved in a centralized execution, hence preserving the distribution of the data, and providing running statistics that accurately approximate the global statistics.
FBN thereby reduces the external covariate shift and matches the evaluation performance of the centralized setting.
We also show that, with a slight increase in complexity,
we can robustify FBN to mitigate erroneous statistics and potentially adversarial attacks.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a prominent machine learning paradigm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, owing to its ability to train models without requiring centralized data storage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. In FL, the training data is held by multiple devices (referred to as <em id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">clients</em>), and the training process is orchestrated by a central server, which coordinates with the clients to train a model on the union of their datasets. Crucially, clients do not share their raw data with the server, thereby substantially reducing the lack of data sovereignty commonly associated with traditional centralized learning methods. In short, this distributed approach ensures that sensitive information remains on local devices, enhancing data ownership and security. Although FL is likely to become a standard in modern machine learning, it remains poorly understood/used in many respects e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. In particular, some of the powerful techniques that have been
developed to boost the performance of centralized learning do not have their analogue in distributed environments.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Batch Normalization.</span> BatchNorm is a prominent example of such techniques.
This popular scheme in centralized deep learning is widely used when training convolutional or feed-forward neural networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. BatchNorm stabilizes and accelerates the learning by normalizing the inputs to each layer of the network using the mean and variance of the previous layer’s outputs. During the training phase, BatchNorm performs two essential tasks. First, it reduces the <em id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">internal covariate shift</em> of the network, ensuring that the input to each layer has a consistent distribution throughout the entire training procedure <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Second, BatchNorm maintains <em id="S1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">running statistics</em>, such as the running mean and running variance of each layer, over the batches of data being used during training. These running statistics provide a smoothed estimate of the data distribution of each layer, which happens to be crucial for the evaluation phase. In evaluation mode, BatchNorm normalizes the test inputs using the running mean and variance obtained during the training phase, instead of computing batch-specific statistics. This ensures that the model’s behavior is consistent across inputs (and independent of the composition of the test mini-batch), resulting in more stable and reliable predictions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Centralized vs Federated Implementations.</span> Implementing BatchNorm in a centralized setting does not raise any serious challenges. Indeed, as the data is stored on a single machine, the mini-batch being used at any given point during the training procedure constitutes a good approximation of the entire training set. As a result, both the normalization of layers and the computation of running statistics are easy to perform and relatively consistent across batches. In FL, however, each client holds its own local dataset which may not be a faithful representation of the entire population. This hinders the direct application of BatchNorm both during the training and the <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">evaluation phase <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite></span>. Essentially, the heterogeneity between clients’ local datasets leads to inconsistencies between local statistics that can affect the overall training procedure, potentially slowing down convergence and reducing model accuracy. Furthermore, during the evaluation phase, most existing implementations simply average the running means and variances of the clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. While this is a reasonable strategy when clients have identical datasets, when local datasets are heterogeneous, this creates an important bias in the computation of the running variance that can destroy the predictive performance of the model.
Arguably, the need to deal with the statistical disparities of the clients and to ensure consistent model performance requires to rethink the way BatchNorm is implemented in FL. We tackle this challenge by introducing an improved version of BatchNorm for FL, called Federated BatchNorm (FBN) which, while rather simple, is quite powerful for it matches the performance of centralized BatchNorm learning. Our contributions can be summarized as follows.</p>

<div id="S1.I1.i1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We first explain why straightforward implementations of BatchNorm in distributed environments fail to match the performance of centralized methods. The rationale behind this phenomenon is twofold. On the one hand, since the clients normalize the layers’ inputs using only their individual statistics, they essentially never have access to the global information from other clients. By considering the special case of a 1-layer neural network with local Gaussian distributions, we show that this lack of global information makes the data less separable, hence making the learning procedure much harder to perform. On the other hand, the averaging of the running variance during the evaluation phase creates an important bias that further reduces the performance of the distributed implementation compared to the centralized one.</p>

<div id="S1.I1.i2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.I1.i2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We then introduce Federated BatchNorm (FBN), an improved version of BatchNorm that aims to align the normalization processes in FL with that of a centralized setting. The rationale behind FBN is to have the server send the running statistics of previous rounds to the clients to serve as a good approximation of the global statistics of the network. However, as mentioned above, these statistics can be biased due to the <em id="S1.I1.i2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" style="color:#000000;">external covariate shift</em><span id="S1.I1.i2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;"> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite></span>. We circumvent this drawback by unbiasing the running variance, thus ensuring that the aggregated statistics are computed correctly. Essentially, FBN provides a dual solution: (i) it ensures that the batch normalization <em id="S1.I1.i2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">during training</em> is consistent, hence preserving the separability of the data, and (ii) it provides running statistics that accurately approximate the global statistics, thereby reducing the external covariate shift and allowing to match the evaluation performance of the centralized setting.
We empirically evaluate FBN on the CIFAR-10 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> classification task under several levels of data heterogeneity, and show that it matches the performance of centralized BatchNorm learning.</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, in light of the recent literature on the vulnerability of FL methods to Byzantine clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, we evaluate the robustness of FBN to this type of threats. We show that the robustness of FBN can easily be enhanced through the use of robust aggregation techniques such as <em id="S1.I1.i3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">coordinate-wise median</em> or <em id="S1.I1.i3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">coordinate-wise trimmed mean</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. We empirically evaluate these defense mechanisms, and show that our algorithm defends better against this threat model than the traditional implementation of BatchNorm in FL.</p>

<div id="S1.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Several recent works have attempted to align the behavior of BatchNorm in FL with that of the centralized setting. Notably, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> proposes a method where local statistics are computed and transmitted to the server during the forward pass. The server then aggregates these statistics and returns the result of the aggregation, enabling the clients to normalize their data using the global distribution. Clients must however wait, at each layer of the model, for the server’s response before proceeding, as the output of one layer impacts the input of subsequent ones. This results in communication overhead and latency, rendering the method very time-consuming. FBN does not suffer from the same limitation as it essentially requires the same amount of communication as a standard FL scheme.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Alternatively, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> introduces FixBN, which operates in two phases. In the first phase, FixBN functions exactly like BatchNorm to reach a point where the gradients do not vary too much. In the second phase, FixBN stops using batch-specific statistics, and uses the running mean and variance aggregated by the server during the first phase. While FixBN significantly enhances the final performance of BatchNorm in FL, it has two important limitations. First, the model’s performance is sub-optimal during the first phase, requiring prior knowledge of the total number of learning steps, which is not necessary for BatchNorm in centralized settings. Second, the running mean and variance are biased, and the statistics communicated by the clients do not allow the server to correct this bias. Our approach circumvents these limitations, as it is agnostic to the number of training steps and sends sufficient information to the server to compute unbiased estimates of the global statistics.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Another line of research has focused on leveraging alternatives to BatchNorm developed in centralized settings. For instance, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> uses Group Normalization (introduced in  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>) which is independent of batch size and computes statistics on groups of channels within the models.
Alternatively, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> claims that the covariate shift cannot be avoided in FL and suggests to use Layer Normalization (first introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>) instead of BatchNorm. This solution renders the normalization process batch size-independent and effective for recurrent neural networks. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> also proposes to only use BatchNorm in personalized FL settings so that each client can retain their own statistics and parameters. Finally,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> proposes a method that removes the BatchNorm component and rather reparameterizes convolution layers with scaled weight standardization. Although these approaches represent significant progress in overcoming the challenges associated with BatchNorm in FL, they are mainly motivated by the alleged impracticality of accurately computing distributed batch norm statistics. Our work shows that BatchNorm can be used efficiently in a distributed environment, without having to resort to complex methods and without impacting the communication efficiency of the training algorithm.</p>

The most common approach to this minimization problem in machine learning is to run a mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm.
SGD iteratively computes gradients on mini-batches of data sampled from the training set <math id="S2.p1.10.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="S" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.p1.10.m2.1a"><mi id="S2.p1.10.m2.1.1" xref="S2.p1.10.m2.1.1.cmml">S</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.p1.10.m2.1b"><ci id="S2.p1.10.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p1.10.m2.1.1">𝑆</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.p1.10.m2.1c">S</annotation></semantics></math>.
The driving principle of BatchNorm is to use the specificity of these mini-batch computations to stabilize and accelerate the training.

This is intended to avoid external covariate shifts.
In fact, since the running statistics are the same at every client, using them to normalize the inputs of each layer results in the same normalization function across the clients. However, as explained previously, the running variance can be biased when dealing with heterogeneous data.
Hence, the update of the running statistics on the clients’ side, as well as their aggregation at the server, must be performed carefully to compensate the bias introduced by heterogeneity.
Essentially, our goal is to update the running variance as if it was computed in a centralized setting, i.e., applying BatchNorm on the union of the clients’ inputs.
To do this, following the law of total variance, a term removing the bias in the averaging of the local running variances must be added as follows (see also line 10 in Algorithm <a href="#alg2" title="Algorithm 2 ‣ 4 Federated BatchNorm (FBN) ‣ Overcoming the Challenges of Batch Normalization in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>):</p>

In particular, it preserves data separability, in contrast to a Naive BatchNorm implementation.
To better understand the interplay between separability and external covariate shift, we run the same experiment with FixBN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, the best-known adaptation of BatchNorm to FL from the literature (Figure <a href="#S4.F2.sf2" title="In Figure 2 ‣ 4 Federated BatchNorm (FBN) ‣ Overcoming the Challenges of Batch Normalization in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2b</span></a>).
Although FixBN also preserves data separability, it fails to correctly normalize the data due to the bias in the running variance.
Because external covariate shifts arise from data heterogeneity, we show in Figure <a href="#S4.F2.sf3" title="In Figure 2 ‣ 4 Federated BatchNorm (FBN) ‣ Overcoming the Challenges of Batch Normalization in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2c</span></a> how each approach (FBN, FixBN, and Naive BatchNorm) compares to centralized normalization for different levels of heterogeneity (described in detail below).
For each heterogeneity level (see ‘Modeling heterogeneity’ below for more details on computing each level),
Under four heterogeneity Figure <a href="#S4.F2.sf3" title="In Figure 2 ‣ 4 Federated BatchNorm (FBN) ‣ Overcoming the Challenges of Batch Normalization in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2c</span></a> plots the normalization error of every algorithm, measured as the Euclidean distance between the normalized points and those returned in a centralized setting, averaged over all <math id="S4.p3.5.m5.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="100" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.p3.5.m5.1a"><mn id="S4.p3.5.m5.1.1" xref="S4.p3.5.m5.1.1.cmml">100</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.p3.5.m5.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S4.p3.5.m5.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.p3.5.m5.1.1">100</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.p3.5.m5.1c">100</annotation></semantics></math> rounds.
FBN remains consistently close to that of the centralized case across all levels of heterogeneity, whereas the error of FixBN and Naive BatchNorm increases with heterogeneity.

As the setting becomes more heterogeneous, the improvement induced by FBN becomes more apparent.
Indeed, when <math id="S4.p6.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\gamma=0.01" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.p6.4.m4.1a"><mrow id="S4.p6.4.m4.1.1" xref="S4.p6.4.m4.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.p6.4.m4.1.1.2" xref="S4.p6.4.m4.1.1.2.cmml">γ</mi><mo id="S4.p6.4.m4.1.1.1" xref="S4.p6.4.m4.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S4.p6.4.m4.1.1.3" xref="S4.p6.4.m4.1.1.3.cmml">0.01</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.p6.4.m4.1b"><apply id="S4.p6.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.p6.4.m4.1.1"><eq id="S4.p6.4.m4.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.p6.4.m4.1.1.1"></eq><ci id="S4.p6.4.m4.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.p6.4.m4.1.1.2">𝛾</ci><cn type="float" id="S4.p6.4.m4.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.p6.4.m4.1.1.3">0.01</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.p6.4.m4.1c">\gamma=0.01</annotation></semantics></math>, BatchNorm loses 40 points in accuracy to reach 40%, while the accuracy of FixBN drops only slightly, and that of FBN remains unchanged.
In the extreme niid setting, the performance of Naive BatchNorm collapses, delivering a best-case accuracy close to 17%.
FixBN also exhibits poorer performance, with its maximum accuracy decreasing to 75%.
Contrastingly, FBN remains unaffected by the increase in heterogeneity, and matches
the maximal accuracy of 80% achieved in the centralized setting.
These aforementioned observations are also conveyed in Figures <a href="#S4.F3.sf2" title="In Figure 3 ‣ 4 Federated BatchNorm (FBN) ‣ Overcoming the Challenges of Batch Normalization in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3b</span></a> and <a href="#S4.F3.sf3" title="In Figure 3 ‣ 4 Federated BatchNorm (FBN) ‣ Overcoming the Challenges of Batch Normalization in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3c</span></a>
Moreover, while we observe that FixBN reaches a satisfactory final accuracy under extreme heterogeneity, this algorithm struggles in the first 1500 iterations of the learning (right plot), which correspond to the first phase of the algorithm. Indeed, as mentioned in Section <a href="#S1.SS2" title="1.2 Related Work ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Overcoming the Challenges of Batch Normalization in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1.2</span></a>, FixBN operates exactly like BatchNorm during its first phase, explaining its sub-optimal performance. In its second phase, FixBN steadily improves in performance and eventually achieves an accuracy of 75%.
Contrarily, our algorithm does not require prior knowledge of the number of iterations, and almost exactly matches the performance of centralized learning throughout the entire execution in both heterogeneity regimes.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">When implementing machine learning algorithms in a distributed environment, it is paramount to deal with malfunctioning clients, often referred to as Byzantine clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
These threats encompass a range of adversarial scenarios, ranging from simple errors due to software bugs or hardware issues to more severe issues like data poisoning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.
The Byzantine threat may also refer to adversarial clients solely aiming to disrupt the learning and preventing it from converging to a satisfactory model. While these issues have been addressed in the context of exchanging gradients or model parameters <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> in distributed learning algorithms (e.g., DSGD, FedAvg), they remain unexplored for distributed batch normalization. In our setting, the presence of Byzantine clients translates to local statistics sent by some clients being incorrect, whether due to intent or inadvertent errors. Averaging all clients’ means and variances (as suggested in lines <a href="#alg2.l9" title="In Algorithm 2 ‣ 4 Federated BatchNorm (FBN) ‣ Overcoming the Challenges of Batch Normalization in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>-<a href="#alg2.l10" title="In Algorithm 2 ‣ 4 Federated BatchNorm (FBN) ‣ Overcoming the Challenges of Batch Normalization in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a> of Algorithm <a href="#alg2" title="Algorithm 2 ‣ 4 Federated BatchNorm (FBN) ‣ Overcoming the Challenges of Batch Normalization in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>) is not robust against arbitrary perturbations in these statistics, which could severely impact the training procedure, especially if these faulty statistics are maliciously crafted. This section highlights the inherent vulnerabilities of distributed batch norm implementations in this context. We demonstrate that robust <span id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">gradient aggregation</span> mechanisms proposed in Byzantine ML <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> can be effectively applied to make FBN robust to various types of faults.</p>

Indeed, in both heterogeneity settings, Naive BatchNorm (purple) is completely unable to learn, stagnating at an accuracy close to 10%.
Contrastingly, FBN (orange) shows a better learning dynamic where it is able to learn in the beginning reaching an accuracy close to 70%.
Similarly to Naive BatchNorm, not defending against the SF attack proves also to be detrimental for FBN, as its performance quickly degrades especially under extreme heterogeneity.</p>

This can also be seen in extreme heterogeneity, where both ‘Naive BatchNorm - No attack’ and ‘Naive BatchNorm - median’ portray equally poor performance.
On the contrary, FBN combined with the robust median aggregation (green) successfully defends against SF in both heterogeneity settings, and matches almost exactly the performance of FBN without attack (blue).
This illustrates the superior performance of our algorithm in terms of robustness compared to Naive BatchNorm, and also highlights the importance of correctly estimating the bias when computing the aggregate statistics at the server.
Furthermore, this analysis clearly showcases the serious vulnerabilities of the distributed batch norm in terms of robustness to faulty statistics.
In fact, a simple attack like SF, where the adversarial clients only modify the mean by sending its opposite, suffices to completely destroy the learning in the absence of a proper defense mechanism at the server.
These observations are also conveyed, in an even stronger fashion, when the adversarial clients execute stronger attacks such as FOE and ALIE.
Indeed, against these attacks, the discrepancy between Naive BatchNorm - No attack and Naive BatchNorm - median is more significant, while FBN combined with the median completely matches the performance of the algorithm under no attack (see for example Figure <a href="#A3.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ C.3.1 Results with 𝛾-similarity ‣ C.3 Comprehensive Results on Robustness of FBN ‣ Appendix C Additional Experimental results ‣ Overcoming the Challenges of Batch Normalization in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a> in Appendix <a href="#A3.SS3" title="C.3 Comprehensive Results on Robustness of FBN ‣ Appendix C Additional Experimental results ‣ Overcoming the Challenges of Batch Normalization in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">C.3</span></a>).</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We have presented a novel and principled approach to apply BatchNorm to FL algorithms.
Our approach, FBN, outperforms existing BatchNorm mechanisms, matching the results of a centralized setting. It is further able to defend against documented adversarial attacks when combined with robust aggregation techniques. The main idea of our scheme is to replace batch-specific computations by running statistics to avoid blowing up the communication complexity of the algorithm. Interestingly, even-though our method does not use batch-specific information, it is both accurate and efficient. This observation opens an intriguing question on whether normalization needs to be batch-specific in the first place. We believe that further exploring novel normalization algorithms in FL that eschew batches entirely is therefore worth investigating.</p>
