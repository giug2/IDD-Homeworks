<p id="id5.id1" class="ltx_p">Pervasive computing promotes the integration of smart devices in our living spaces to develop services providing assistance to people. Such smart devices are increasingly relying on cloud-based Machine Learning, which raises questions in terms of security (data privacy), reliance (latency), and communication costs. In this context, Federated Learning (FL) has been introduced as a new machine learning paradigm enhancing the use of local devices. At the server level, FL aggregates models learned locally on distributed clients to obtain a more general model.
In this way, no private data is sent over the network, and the communication cost is reduced. Unfortunately, however, the most popular federated learning algorithms have been shown not to be adapted to some highly heterogeneous pervasive computing environments. In this paper, we propose a new FL algorithm, termed FedDist, which can modify models (here, deep neural network) during training by identifying dissimilarities between neurons among the clients. This permits to account for clients’ specificity without impairing generalization.
FedDist evaluated with three state-of-the-art federated learning algorithms on three large heterogeneous mobile Human Activity Recognition datasets. Results have shown the ability of FedDist to adapt to heterogeneous data and the capability of FL to deal with asynchronous situations.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Pervasive computing relies on the integration of smart devices in our living spaces to support the development of services to individuals and organizations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. For several years, we have seen the emergence of smarter services based on Machine Learning (ML) techniques. ML enables the production of highly performing decision systems by identifying patterns that may be hidden within massive data sets whose exact nature is unknown and therefore cannot be programmed explicitly. Bringing such services into production nevertheless raises major architectural problems. According to most current solutions, ML models are built in the cloud using historical data, then deployed and executed on devices or on the edge. Additional data is then regularly collected by the devices and sent to the cloud in order to build new and more up-to-date models. Such an approach, however, undergoes major limitations in terms of security, performance, resilience and even cost.</p>

The new model is redistributed to devices for the next local learning iteration. Federated learning reduces communication costs and improves security because no private data (only models) is exchanged <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. It has immediately attracted attention in the pervasive field but, so far, it has been essentially used in traditional learning fields like computer vision <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> and still needs to be adapted to the specificity of the pervasive domain. Originally, FL was set out as an alternative form of distributed learning to obtain a single well-performing model on the server-side. However, to deal with pervasive computing, this learning approach should shift from a single server-centric model to a multi client-centric model objective <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. The client models should perform exceedingly well, compared to a single conventionally trained generalized model, on their local data (<em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">strong personalization</em>) and be able to deal with unseen data compared to approaches without any collaborative training (<em id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">good generalization</em>). To reach this goal, challenges are numerous.
In particular, the high <em id="S1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">heterogeneity</em> of the devices is problematic. For instance, smartphones have different brands, sensors, ways of being used which makes data collected in this context challenging for machine learning. It is also well known that mobile devices evolve at different paces and can have very unreliable network connections, which involves synchronization issues. The effects of <em id="S1.p2.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">asynchronicity</em> on FL need investigations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we introduce a new aggregation algorithm, called FedDist with the implementation available on github <span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>PerCom2021-FL - <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/getalp/PerCom2021-FL" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter">https://github.com/getalp/PerCom2021-FL</a></span></span></span>, that has been designed to meet the specific needs of pervasive applications. This algorithm, together with state-of-the-art FL methods, has been assessed in an extensive set of experiments, based on a well-defined evaluation method. These experiments are all performed in the illustrative field of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) on smartphones. This domain aims to automatically identify human physical activities, like running or walking, using sensors embedded in smartphones. HAR is well suited to our FL experiments because activities tend to have generic patterns while being highly idiosyncratic (data depends on people, devices, the way devices are carried, the environment, etc.) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. These experiments have been performed with large, realistic and freely available data to study both the classification performance of the FL algorithms with heterogeneous data and their ability to deal with devices that come and go during the learning process. The results exhibits the relevance of the FL approach for the latter and the superiority of FedDist for the former. Part of this work has been published in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, but this paper presents an updated version with more experiments and a new study on the effect of asynchronicity.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A core incentive of FL in pervasive computing is to utilize mutual learning goals between clients through collaborative learning to share beneficial knowledge with one another. However, despite clients sharing the same goal, effective collaboration in the wild between unmoderated clients, as exemplified in cross-device and vertical FL settings <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, is an open challenge for any collaborative learning framework. The cause is widely known to be due to statistical heterogeneity (difference between client data caused by differences in individual user’s usage) and system heterogeneity (difference between client data caused by different system traits) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">There have been many implementations of FL proposed by the scientific community to tackle heterogeneity. For instance, FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> and FSVRG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> apply local model/gradient controlled learning that limits the divergence of clients. Other approaches, such as FeSEM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> and MLMG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> cluster clients or create more than one server model based on the clients’ similarity. Finally, some FL aggregation algorithms consider local models in their entirety (all layers and neurons) and builds a new model that potentially calls into question all layers and all weights associated with neurons. This approach is shown in FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> and FedMA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> algorithms. Here our study focuses on this last family of solutions to deal with heterogeneity that emphasizes aggregation techniques at the server level and tries to address the question: “How can we effectively combine client models at the server level to create a global model that fits all the clients?”</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we compare FedDist to three representative algorithms, namely FedAvg, FedProx and FedMA.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.SS1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite></span> is the pioneering FL algorithm. The aggregation is performed in a weighted averaging manner that make clients with more data having more weight in the newly aggregated model. FedAvg, however, has a naive form of aggregation due to its coordinate-wise averaging that may lead to sub-optimal solutions. For instance, with non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data, neurons in the same coordinate may be opted for different purposes due to clients’ specialization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.SS1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite></span> adds a proximity term to the learning function of clients to limit the divergence of clients from the server model. This regularization technique allows the local learning to be done with respect to the server model, which allows a more harmonized aggregation for the next server model. FedProx demands a trade-off between personalization and generalization improvement in client model performances that can slow down the global convergence rate.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p6" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS1.p6.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.SS1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">FedMA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite></span> is an FL algorithm that modifies the neural model architecture by incorporating a layer-wise aggregation process where similar neurons can be aggregated and dissimilar ones can be added as new neurons in the architecture. This approach treats the number of nodes in a layer as a sub-problem to solve rather than a hyper-parameter to be set <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. FedMA considers that neurons in a neural network layer are permutation invariant to perform a more intelligent aggregation. The neurons (or filters) can be clustered in a non-parametric way where all neurons in the same cluster are averaged to produce a global neuron. In the search for which neurons can be fused, the algorithm uses a 2D permutation matrix that is computed iteratively from increasing layers level. Our experiments, however, found that calculating the permutation matrix makes the algorithm particularly slow during the aggregation stage.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">2.2 </span>Synthesis</h3>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is a very promising approach but still in its infancy. A major issue today is the lack of structured, extensive tests of the different aggregation algorithms that have been proposed. So far, these algorithms are evaluated independently on traditional learning fields like computer vision, usually on relatively homogeneous data, with no outliers or little divergence at the client-side, although FL has been designed to tackle unevenly distributed data<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Also, most studies do not include the influence of the network or consider the client’s behavior.
Further studies are needed to really understand how the server and client models evolve and how well they behave regarding generalization (can a client model work correctly on data that have not been seen beforehand?) and specialization (can a client work well with data that have the same properties as the one used for training?).</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning has not been widely used in the context of pervasive computing. For instance, there are only a few works in the HAR domain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, with missing analysis regarding the performance of global and local models on generalization and specialization with different approaches. Additionally, most tests were performed on small and pre-processed datasets collected in laboratory environments. Also, existing algorithms do not consider the specific requirements of pervasive computing, where data is usually heterogeneous and the learning problem may change over communication rounds as clients drop in and out of the learning pool. For instance, FedAvg is bounded to a single model shape with a fixed amount of filters or neurons to tackle an ever-growing problem (since new data and clients keep coming). Finally, contrary to centralized learning, where the model is learned to increase performance on one unique dataset, in our vision of FL the objective is to increase all individual clients’ performances. To do so, FL must account for the fact that data, even though in the same domain, might evolve very differently according to the clients and would necessitate adapting the features to be induced (i.e., the representation must be learned again). In order to account for the heterogeneity of clients, a solution must be found to adapt the global model in a way that makes it respect the peculiarity of each client. The FedDist algorithm presented below is our attempt to reach this goal.</p>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we present a novel neuron matching algorithm for FL based on a euclidean distance dissimilarity measurement. This algorithm, which includes some elements of FedAvg and FedMA, is called FedDist (Federated Distance) for its emphasis on computing distances of neurons of similar coordinates when comparing clients and server models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">FedDist recognizes, like FedMA, that some client’s models may diverge because of heterogeneous data. This results in neurons that cannot be matched with neurons from other models (because of weights that are too far apart). A naive coordinate averaging approach, like in FedAvg, has very negative effects. Indeed, these diverging neurons are simply erased by the averaging process, while they are actually able to deal with specific situations not encountered by other clients. FedDist also recognizes that the model’s structure is relatively stable, which means that neurons with the exact coordinates play a similar role. This view provides an opportunity to build on a coordinate-wise approach.</p>

<div id="S3.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">FedDist identifies diverging neurons using euclidean distances. These neurons that are specific to certain clients are added to the aggregated model as new neurons. We believe that this technique is particularly suited for tackling sparse data, where specific features are only found in a small subset of clients or data points. Thus, this new neuron adding scheme can lead to larger models that are able to generalize better. As new neurons are added to a layer, a layer-wise training round is added in order to allow the neurons in the next layers to adjust to the new incoming neurons and weights. To do so, the layer with the new neuron and those below are frozen, and the subsequent layers are trained. This introduces intermediate communication rounds: a full communication round is finished when all layers have been treated, and a new aggregated model is computed. This process is summarized in Figure <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 3 FedDist, A Dynamic Model Growth Algorithm In Federated Learning ‣ Evaluation and Comparison of Federated Learning Algorithms for Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones This work has been partially funded by Naval Group, and by MIAI@Grenoble Alpes (ANR-19-P3IA-0003).

Hence, the ideal dataset(s) should be: freely accessible, acquired in real-life environments with several participants and devices, include high-class imbalance, and carefully annotated.

However, this dataset is not realistic (it was acquired in-lab following strict scenarios), and it is small in size (3.6 hours). Since the size and diversity of the data is an essential requirement of our study, we have selected three large, realistic, and freely available datasets described below.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The <span id="S4.SS1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">RealWorld</span> dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, which contains 18 hours of recorded data, including accelerometer and gyroscope readings. Data were collected in 2016 from 15 subjects in 7 different device/body position configurations, using Samsung Galaxy S4 and LG G Watch R with a sampling rate of 50 Hz. The recording was performed outdoor, where the subjects were told to perform specific activities without any restraints. Eight activities have been labeled in the data: Climbing Down, Climbing Up, Lying, Sitting, Standing, Walking, Jumping, and Running. We believe the RealWorld dataset represents HAR data well in the wild and exhibits realistic high-class imbalance (for instance, the ‘standing’ activity represents 14% of the data while the ‘jumping’ one is limited to 2%). Furthermore, the dataset is particularly relevant for the study since a single participants’ data can model each client as one would expect in realistic pervasive computing scenarios.s</p>

<div id="S4.SS1.p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The <span id="S4.SS1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Heterogeneity Human Activity Recognition (HHAR)</span> dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> accounts for 4.5 hours of recorded activities. Each of the 9 participants carried 8 Android smartphones (2 LG-Nexus 4, 2 Samsung Galaxy S3, 2 Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini, and 2 Samsung Galaxy S+) within a compact pouch and 4 Android smartwatches (2 LG watches and 2 Samsung Galaxy Gears) with 2 on each arm, were asked to perform five minutes of 6 activities (Biking, Sitting, Standing, Walking, Stair Up and Stair down). All 12 devices recorded the activities using the on-system accelerometer and gyroscope measurements to their respective maximum sampling rate (Various sampling ranges between 50 and 200 Hz). It is also interesting to mention that the authors of the dataset highlighted that the devices have gone through previous daily-life usage and hints of real-life induced usage errors on the recording device.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.p6" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the variety and number of recording instruments, the HHAR dataset introduces a new evaluation perspective for FL algorithms on not just statistical heterogeneity but also system heterogeneity. To emphasize system heterogeneity, we combined the sensor data for each brand and treated them as one client (e.g., the two LG-Nexus 4 on subject one are considered as the data of a single client). As a result, from the 6 unique devices and 9 clients, we generated 51 clients in total. Due to missing gyroscope data, 3 clients were discarded. Creating client from the same users reduces but does not erase the challenge of statistical heterogeneity since the devices where positioned at the same place on the body <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.</p>

It was recorded by 3 different users throughout their daily lives, each over a period of 3 days, with 4 different device/body positions. We only took the accelerometer and gyroscope data for our experiment while leaving out GPS, barometer, and magnetometer data for coherency purposes with the other dataset. The data were collected using only Huawei Mate 9 smartphones with a sampling rate of 100Hz. Each user was recorded in 3 distinct time sessions, with each session focused on different locomotions/activities. The SHL dataset has 6 labels: Still, Walking, Run, Bike, Car, Bus, Train, and Subway. Using the three different periods for each user data collection instance that came pre-segregated in the dataset, we generated 3 clients for each of the 3 users. The result is 9 clients for our simulations. However, the class distribution over the periods (i.e., clients) was severely imbalanced (e.g., subway and train were abundant in one client, but there were nearly no car labels). This imbalance is why a stratified split over the class labels was applied for each user data to compose clients with a balanced distribution (the reader is referred to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> for promising solutions to deal with the class imbalance in an FL context).</p>

<div id="S4.SS1.p8" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">As some data were recorded with devices with different sampling rates, we had applied down-sampling on the collected data to a lower frequency of 50Hz. Such sampling frequency and data selection are in line with a survey on HAR on smartphones <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> that has shown that the optimal sampling frequency is between 20 Hz and 50Hz and that accelerometers and gyroscopes are the most adequate sensors for classification.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As previously explained, the interest of FL over classical learning is the ability to merge several client models into a global one in order to improve genericity without degrading specialization. To assess these properties, we then decided to compute three different metrics for each experiment:</p>

</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Another important question of the evaluation is how to model clients. Many FL studies partition a unique dataset into several equally distributed datasets to represent the clients. This is not a realistic way of simulating heterogeneous clients. In our study on the RealWorld and HHAR datasets, each client is represented by unique traits such as a specific individual’s activity habits, devices and device position.
In that way, the FL algorithm is left dealing with a very personalized local model, which corresponds to realistic settings.

<div id="S4.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In the rest of this work, for HAR performance metrics, we have used standard classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. From these, we have computed the F1 score as a complementary measure that gives a per-class evaluation, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, in contrast with conventional federated learning, where the goal is very server-centric and the objective is to optimize the server model for better Global accuracy, we seek a clients-centric optimization. Our goal is that clients get well personalised while still able to deal with new situations. Hence, we mainly focus on improving the Personalization and Generalization accuracy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.p6" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, it is worth noting that, beyond accuracy assessment, the level of heterogeneity of the learning environment can be observed through the gap between the Personalization and Generalization accuracy of the ‘Local’ training setting. A large difference is the consequence of very heterogeneous clients (e.g. as with the HHAR dataset) while a small difference means that clients are homogeneous with one another (e.g. with the clients of the SHL dataset).</p>

Furthermore, the local test sets were aggregated into a global test set, used to evaluate the genericity/personalization trade-off of the different algorithms.
The input data of the datasets were provided by the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) of smartphones. That is the 3-axis accelerometer data with the 3-axis gyroscope data (down)sampled at 50hz. As common in deep learning approaches (i.e., features are learned and not hand-crafted), no features extraction was applied to let the model build its own representation. The data was preprocessed using channel-wise z-normalization and sampled using a window-frame size of 128 with a 50 overlap of 6 channels of each axis.</p>

It has the lowest ability to personalize with some minor drawbacks (Personalization accuracy = 93.65%) while performing moderately on the global test-set (Generalization accuracy = 60.09%). Furthermore, FedMA has a much higher training cost. Indeed, in our experimentation, 5 local epochs are used to train client models. For FedMA, this means a total of 25 local epochs for each communication round (5 local epochs for each of the first and second layer, and another 15 for the softmax layers).</p>

This is because at a certain point, after many communication rounds, no new neuron or filter is added to the global model, and thus, training can stabilize better onward. This behavior is further enforced with a penalty function that takes the current communication round as input to raise new neurons’ acceptance rate in later rounds. After no new neurons are needed, we expect the late stages of training similar to the FedAvg algorithm. However, the initial step was sufficient to present better performances than FedAvg. In the end, FedDist gets the best Generalization accuracy (e.g., the best trade-off between generalization and personalization) and could even reach more with further training.
The final CNN model for FedDist has grown from 196 to 222 filters for the 1st layer (growth of 1.13) and from 1024 neurons to 2246 (growth of 2.19).

<p id="S5.SS3.SSS2.p1.2" class="ltx_p">In the following, only FedAvg and FedDist of the FL implementations algorithms were evaluated on the HHAR and SHL datasets since FedMA and FedProx were not found to be competitive in Personalization and Generalization. FedMA in our heterogeneous learning environment could not fix a new architecture shape that matched the collaborative learning need. FedProx, in its nature, is very server model-centric, while the theme of our works is a client-centric one where we emphasize the user model’s Personalization and Generalization gains.
On the highly diverse and client intensive (51) HHAR dataset, the results shown in Table <a href="#S5.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 5.3.2 Results on the HHAR and SHL datasets ‣ 5.3 Federated Learning Results ‣ 5 Experiment and Results ‣ Evaluation and Comparison of Federated Learning Algorithms for Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones This work has been partially funded by Naval Group, and by MIAI@Grenoble Alpes (ANR-19-P3IA-0003).

This is clearly due to the client’s heterogeneity which also explains the large standard deviation values. Regarding the global score, the centralized approach here has a strong F-score of 96.74% (against FedAvg’s 80.70% and FedDist 82.81%). Here, FedDist was still able to outperform FedAvg with a 1.6% increase in personalization score and a near 4% increase in generalization score. Surprisingly, the local personalization score which has the best in all other experiments, was beaten by FedDist. The two-layered CNN had grown substantially, with 257 filters in the 1st convolutional layer and 8558 neurons in the 2nd dense layer. Despite this growth FedAvg<sub id="S5.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.1" class="ltx_sub"><span id="S5.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedDist_size</span></sub> was not able to benefit from the higher capacity and exhibits performances even below the original FedAvg. The study on the HHAR dataset exhibits the need for better system heterogeneity management in FL methods. Federated learning should not only take into account the idiosyncratic-ness of user behavior but should also address the difference between users’ hardware.
For the SHL Dataset, FedAvg and FedDist give the same results for all three metrics (hence FedAvg<sub id="S5.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.2" class="ltx_sub"><span id="S5.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedDist_size</span></sub> also gives the same results). This is due to the class-stratified distribution done to generate uniform clients. Here FedDist behaves as expected; when client models are very similar to one another, no new neuron will be added to the model. This shows that when client models are sufficiently similar, FedDist behaves as FedAvg.</p>

<p id="S5.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In pervasive computing, clients are mobile and can be disconnected/reconnected anytime. Hence, FL must be robust to such situations where the consequences can be detrimental to the learning. To study this behavior, we implemented an active/idle client pool to modulate the number of clients at each communication round. Such study also provides insight regarding the behavior of the method with respect to unseen users. Using the 15 subjects of the RealWorld dataset, we experimented with three different asynchronous environment scenarios: <span id="S5.SS4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Incrementing clients</span> (the training starts with 2 clients, and every 14 rounds, a new client is added to the active client pool), <span id="S5.SS4.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Decrementing clients</span> (the training starts with 15 clients and every 14 rounds, a client is removed), <span id="S5.SS4.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Interchanging clients</span> (at every round, 8 clients are randomly selected).</p>

<div id="S5.SS4.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The effect of the three simulations is shown in Figure <a href="#S5.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ 5.4 Asynchronous Clients ‣ 5 Experiment and Results ‣ Evaluation and Comparison of Federated Learning Algorithms for Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones This work has been partially funded by Naval Group, and by MIAI@Grenoble Alpes (ANR-19-P3IA-0003).

However, when a new client joins the active pool, the active clients exhibit a sharp variation in their Personalization score (green curves). This is expected since active clients must adapt to the newly added model. However, the clients could all recover to well-performing scores within a few communication training rounds.
In the decrementing case (Figure <a href="#S5.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ Figure 8 ‣ 5.4 Asynchronous Clients ‣ 5 Experiment and Results ‣ Evaluation and Comparison of Federated Learning Algorithms for Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones This work has been partially funded by Naval Group, and by MIAI@Grenoble Alpes (ANR-19-P3IA-0003).

An interesting behavior is that Generalization score is overall gaining in performance despite the removal of clients from the active pool and obtains a generalization level reasonably close to non-asynchronous experiments (reaching  70%). This finding shows that the remaining client can still benefit from the previous client’s model that has left earlier. This phenomena hints specialized neurons obtained being able to retain previously learned features for continual learning purposes. In addition, the simulation suggests that the server model can retain knowledge from previous clients that are no longer in the active training pool.
Finally, in the Interchanging case (Figure <a href="#S5.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ Figure 8 ‣ 5.4 Asynchronous Clients ‣ 5 Experiment and Results ‣ Evaluation and Comparison of Federated Learning Algorithms for Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones This work has been partially funded by Naval Group, and by MIAI@Grenoble Alpes (ANR-19-P3IA-0003).

The results here show that clients do not need to be present at every communication round to contribute to and benefit from FL.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) exhibits clear theoretical advantages over classical centralized learning from a pervasive computing perspective. It provides a solution for distributed learning and, to some extent, privacy preservation. However, little is known about the behavior of such a learning approach and how to evaluate it in realistic pervasive computing situations.
Despite the fact that FL is becoming an active research area, our study reveals that the standard simple FL algorithm FedAvg is difficult to beat and that recent complex algorithms do not demonstrate a clear superiority. However, our evaluation method showed that our new FL algorithm FedDist outperformed the other FL algorithms on the three measures of generalization and personalization. Indeed, FL should lead to a high degree of adaptation to the device while keeping a high degree of generalization (e.g., prevent over-fitting and high client accuracy on global data). FedAvg also exhibited such behavior, but more complex FL algorithms such as FedMA and FedPer could not keep a high degree of generalization and did not show a superior capacity for personalization. On another note, choosing the optimal number of neurons for each layer of a NN is an open problem. FedDist relaxes the need to perform intensive hyper-parameter searches for the best model shape through the algorithm’s ability to compute specialized neurons that are appended to the global model architecture. Finally, our study shows that FedDist exhibited good robustness to asynchronous learning when devices come and go during the learning.

<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Although these results show the interest of FL for pervasive computing, many challenges remain. For example, long-term studies are needed to optimize communication schedules and deal with lifelong learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. For example, our study did not examine the effect of extreme variations in class distribution across time and clients. Some preliminary work on the topic using continuous learning suggests that such a case is difficult <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, due to the lack of large datasets from different users, FedDist has yet to be evaluated on a large scale. This requires a community effort to build large datasets and establish benchmarks for comparison and replication of research in this area.</p>
