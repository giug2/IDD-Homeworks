<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Vehicular networks enable vehicles support some real-time applications through training data. Due to the limited computing capability of vehicles, vehicles usually transmit data to a road side unit (RSU) deployed along the road to process data collaboratively. However, vehicles are usually reluctant to share data with each other due to the inevitable data privacy. For the traditional federated learning (FL), vehicles train the data locally to obtain a local model and then upload the local model to the RSU to update the global model through aggregation, thus the data privacy can be protected through sharing model instead of raw data. The traditional FL requires to update the global model synchronously, i.e., the RSU needs to wait for all vehicles to upload local models to update the global model. However, vehicles may usually drive out of the coverage of the marked RSU before they obtain their local models through training, which reduces the accuracy of the global model. In this paper, a mobility-aware vehicular asynchronous federated learning (AFL) is proposed to solve this problem, where the RSU updates the global model once it receives a local model from a vehicle where the mobility of vehicles, amount of data and computing capability are taken into account. Simulation experiments validate that our scheme outperforms the conventional AFL scheme.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the development of vehicular networks, vehicles can support the real-time applications such as speech recognition and multimedia sharing to facilitate people’s life<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
In the vehicular networks, vehicles collect data from surroundings or networking and train the models based on raw data to support the vehicular services.
Due to the limited computing capability, vehicles usually transmit data to a fog or cloud with powerful computing, large storage and strong processing capability, then the fog or cloud processes the data and sends back the computing results to the corresponding vehicles in the vehicular networks. The fog or cloud is usually far from the vehicles, and thus incur a large delay due to the long transmitting distance.
To solve this issue, edge-assisted vehicular networks are introduced to process the data at a road side unit (RSU) deployed along the road in order to reduce the delay. However, vehicles are usually reluctant to share data with each other due to data privacy, thus the RSU may not be able to collect enough data to train an accurate model for vehicular services.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) provides a possible way to solve the above problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. For the traditional FL, the RSU updates the global model for multiple rounds. For each round, each vehicle first downloads the global model from the marked RSU, then trains its local model based on the downloaded global model parameters. After that, each vehicle uploads its new updated local model to the RSU to further update the global model through aggregation. Thus the data privacy can be protected through sharing model parameters instead of raw data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">It is known that the traditional FL requires to update the global model synchronously, i.e., the RSU needs to wait for all vehicles to upload local models to update the global model in each round. However, vehicles may usually drive out of the coverage of the RSU before they get their own new update of local models. Therefore, the RSU cannot aggregate them of the vehicles to update the global model on time, resulting in reduction of the accuracy of the global model. The asynchronous federated learning (AFL) is essentially developed to solve this problem, where the RSU updates the global model once a vehicle uploads its local model, thus the global model can be updated in time without waiting for other vehicles to upload the local model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In the edge-assisted vehicular networks, the positions of vehicles are time-varying due to the mobility of vehicles. In addition, the amount of data and computing capabilities of different vehicles may be different. These factors will affect the accuracy of the global model for the AFL. Specifically, the time varying position of vehicles will cause different transmitting rates and thus cause different uploading delays, i.e., the time to upload the local model. In addition, the vehicles with different computing capabilities and amounts of data will cause different local training delays, i.e., the time to train each local model. If the time duration of one vehicle from the global model downloading to the local model uploading is relatively large, the RSU may not ignore its role in the current epoch and update the global model based on the other vehicles. In this case, the local model of the vehicle is stale and not accurate, which further delays the convergence of FL and may reduce the accuracy of the global model.
Therefore, it is necessary to consider the mobility of vehicles, the amount of data and computing capability in designing an AFL scheme in the edge-assisted vehicular networks.</p>

However, these works adopt the traditional FL, which needs the RSU to wait all vehicles to upload their models and then update the global model. Vehicles may usually drive out of the coverage of the RSU before they upload their local models, which deteriorates the accuracy of the global model when the traditional FL is adopted.</p>

We can observe that the accuracy under both schemes increases as the number of rounds increases, and finally becomes relatively stable.
This is because the global model is updated by more local models with the number of rounds increases, thus the accuracy of the global model is improved. When the number of rounds continues to increase, the RSU has updated the global model through aggregating enough local models to obtain the accurate global model, thus the accuracy of the global model becomes stable.
In addition, our scheme can finally achieve relatively higher accuracy. This is because our scheme considers amount of data, computing capability and mobility of vehicles to improve the accuracy of the global model.</p>

We can see that the loss under the two schemes decreases as the number of rounds increases. This is because the accuracy under the two schemes increases as the number of rounds increases. Moreover, we can see that our scheme has a lower loss due to that our scheme synthetically considers multiple factors to improve the accuracy of the global model.</p>
