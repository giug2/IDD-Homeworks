<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks are highly sophisticated and employ a multitude of advanced methods and techniques to target organizations and steal sensitive and confidential information. APT attacks consist of multiple stages and have a defined strategy, utilizing new and innovative techniques and technologies developed by hackers to evade security software monitoring. To effectively protect against APTs, detecting and predicting APT indicators with an explanation from Machine Learning (ML) prediction is crucial to reveal the characteristics of attackers lurking in the network system. Meanwhile, Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for building intelligent applications without compromising privacy. This is particularly important in cybersecurity, where sensitive data and high-quality labeling play a critical role in constructing effective machine learning models for detecting cyber threats. Therefore, this work proposes XFedHunter, an explainable federated learning framework for APT detection in Software-Defined Networking (SDN) leveraging local cyber threat knowledge from many training collaborators. In XFedHunter, Graph Neural Network (GNN) and Deep Learning model are utilized to reveal the malicious events effectively in the large number of normal ones in the network system. The experimental results on NF-ToN-IoT and DARPA TCE3 datasets indicate that our framework can enhance the trust and accountability of ML-based systems utilized for cybersecurity purposes without privacy leakage.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is the most lethal and sophisticated threat that cyberspace must withstand. In contrast to traditional attacks, which are more opportunistic and shorter-term in nature, an APT attack is a kind of cyberattack in which attackers lurk in the intended target’s network or system without being detected for a protracted period <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. These attacks are primarily carried out by well-resourced adversaries, usually nation-states or state-sponsored groups, against specific targets using advanced tactics, techniques and procedures <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. They focus on high-value targets like the government, large business entities, and many other institutions. While traditional solutions are still prevalent, contemporary cyber threats like APT attacks can bypass them easily. This scenario has prompted many cybersecurity experts to work towards developing next-generation solutions that can effectively detect and neutralize APT attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">On top of state-of-the-art solutions, the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) remains a crucial component in APT detection. In the Network-based IDS (NIDS) approach, a detector with a global view can quickly identify network-wide attacks that target multiple systems. These abilities allow the NIDS to analyze network traffic for abnormal or suspicious patterns that could be an APT attack. However, identifying new patterns that signify malicious behavior has become increasingly difficult due to the growth in APT attacks. Another promising approach is the Provenance-based IDS (PIDS), especially the provenance graph approach. This approach has powerful semantic expression and correlation analysis capabilities that effectively detect APT-style multistep attacks, as evidenced by many studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Nevertheless, the complexity of the provenance graph presents a significant challenge and even worse, the hasty expansion of the organization is putting additional pressure on security engineers during the graph analysis process.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Hence, there is the place that the Artificial Intelligence (AI) comes into play. The AI solutions introduce a promising approach that will boost the IDS’s performance to a new level, thanks to its capacity to manage the unfathomable accumulation of information and make decisions rapidly. As a result, the AI will become an important factor in optimizing the fight against crime and strengthening national security in the cyberspace <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Aside from the advantages, the AI-based IDS, especially the Deep Learning (DL)-based IDS, requires a substantial quantity of training data that must be updated regularly to maintain the performance of APT attack detector. Unfortunately, data from one organization and public sources are typically insufficient, and sharing resources among organizations would raise security and privacy concerns. Meanwhile, Federated Learning (FL), with its decentralized training capabilities without sharing local data, has emerged as an appropriate remedy to address the aforementioned problems. Any organization joining the FL training process would benefit from sharing the global model, which is aggregated by local models trained by participant parties with their private data, and then updating it with the local data of the organization. Although it is true that some studies have used the FL approach to train DL-based IDS systems, there are only a limited number of studies that have employed this approach in the context of PIDS.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Besides that, Software Defined Networking (SDN) presents a promising architecture that enables a programmable network by centralizing the network configuration process through software-based controllers rather than through manual configuration of individual devices. Moreover, the SDN controller delivers visibility into the entire network, providing a more comprehensive picture of security concerns and becoming a practical means of deploying modern cyber threat detection solutions. In fact, the potential applications of SDN in cybersecurity solutions have been shown on <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Moreover, there have also been many studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> that have already succeeded in leveraging this aspect of SDN and FL methods to detect cyber attacks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">However, there is a problem that Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are typically considered as “black box” by both users and developers due to their comparative weakness in explaining their inference processes and outcomes. Nevertheless, for security analysis, the explainability and transparency of AI-based systems are particularly crucial. Understanding AI’s decision-making process will improve our ability to analyze attacks, especially APT attacks. It also helps us to decrease false positive alerts and contributes to the development of more accurate IDS. Unfortunately, there are not many studies that have explored thoroughly the interpretability of IDS systems, particularly those integrated federated learning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">With the difficulties mentioned earlier in mind, we introduce <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">XFedHunter</span>, an Explainable Federated Learning framework designed for APT detection in the context of SDN. Our framework features a FL-based IDS model that merges NIDS and PIDS into our APT detection system, while leveraging the SDN architecture to create reactive security measures and counter APT attacks. In our APT detection system, we use Graph Neuron Network (GNN), a category of DL methods that can handle graph data with complicated relationships and interdependencies between objects, to tackle challenges associated with provenance graph data. Moreover, we used a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to handle network data in the SDN environment. Then, we leverage a model-agnostic explanation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> framework named SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> into the IDS system to understand AI’s decision-making process. Beyond many related works in tackling the difficult challenge of understanding predictions from the IDS system when wrong alerts happen, we develop a methodology to determine the correctness of model predictions based on the penultimate layer’s outputs of the malicious detection metrics histories. The experimental results on the NF-ToN-IoT dataset and DARPA TCE3 dataset show the efficiency of our framework to improve the interpretability of FL-based IDS against APT attacks and help the cybersecurity experts get a better understanding of IDS’s decisions.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There are many studies that have been carried out to tackle the issues stemming from APT attacks. For instance, Yazdinejadna et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> utilized an IDS module that leveraged a GRU-based algorithm. This module employed both flow-based and packet-based intrusion detection components by monitoring the packet parser and flow tables of SDN switches to detect malicious behavior effectively in SDN networks. Moreover, the authors leveraged the SDN architecture to make the IDS system “jumps” like a kangaroo to announce the attack to other IDSs via the SDN controller, contributing to improved scalability and efficiency. In the other work, Lo and his colleagues <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> introduced a new method for the GNN approach called E-GraphSAGE that allows capturing both the edge features of a graph and the topological information for network intrusion detection in IoT networks using NetFlow data. The above-mentioned researches show the effectiveness of the ML-based IDS system in detecting APT attacks, but none of them leverage the FL method to enhance their detection system in the case of labeled data scarcity.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To accomplish that, Abdel-Basset et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> introduced an efficient framework that leverages a chain of DL blocks to enable cyber-threat detector capacity in detecting abnormal activity in a Microservice-based Industrial Cyber-physical System environment, while using federated learning for the training process. Similarly, in our previous work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, we had already succeeded in testing DNNs including CNN, GRU, and Long short-term memory (LSTM) to handle NetFlow data in the SDN environment while using the FL method to perform a decentralized training process. Likewise, Li and his colleagues <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> introduced an FL-based IDS called DeepFed that utilized a combination of CNN and GRU and demonstrated to be highly effective in detecting various types of cyber threats against Industrial Cyber–Physical Systems. However, beside their success, DL-based models are becoming more and more sophisticated, and users, particularly executive staff and cybersecurity professionals at corporations, rarely interpret the model’s decisions. As a result, the corresponding users are unable to both comprehend and verify the decisions made by DL models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In order to handle the interpretability problems of DL-based IDS discussed earlier, Caforio et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> used the combination of the Grad-CAM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> explanations with the nearest-neighbor search to clarify normal and attack behavior in the network traffic and improved the accuracy of the CNN decisions. However, Grad-CAM was a model-specific explanation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> method that only fits with the CNN model family. And in another work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, Mahbooba and his colleagues explored the interpretable side of the classification algorithm implemented for IDS using a decision tree that was considered a highly interpretable model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. Nevertheless, similar to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> problem, the authors’ method only worked with the decision tree model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To overcome the model restriction issues, several attempts on the model-agnostic explanation method have been conducted <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. Typically, Houda and his colleagues <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> proposed a novel DL-based IDS architecture to protect IoT-based networks against the new emerging IoT-based attacks. Then, the authors applied Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, such as SHAP, RuleFit <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, and LIME <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, into their proposed architecture to optimize the interpretation of decisions made by any DL-based IDS system. Finally, they validated the feasibility of the proposed framework with NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 datasets. Similarly, in the work of Wang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, an XAI framework was created utilizing the SHAP technique to increase the transparency and explainability of any IDS system. Also, the authors created two classifiers (one-vs-all and multi-class) and compared their interpretations. Lastly, the feasibility of their architecture was demonstrated by using the NSL-KDD dataset. These studies demonstrate how well DL-based IDS systems can be interpreted using model-agnostic explanation techniques, particularly the SHAP framework. Unfortunately, there is a lack of research that focuses on interpreting predictions generated by FL-based IDS systems. Furthermore, none of these studies examines the interpretation of predictions in situations in which there is a mixture of explanations for both true and false predictions, nor do they propose a methodology to address this issue.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this research, we propose the XFedHunter framework that leverages SHAP to explain and interpret the results of FL-based IDS while enhancing its detection performance with state-of-the-art NIDS and PIDS in the context of SDN. Besides that, inspired by the research conducted by Fidel et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> in using the XAI signature created from the outputs of the penultimate layer to detect adversarial attack samples, we introduce a novelty to solve the challenge of interpreting explanations when a mixture of explanations for both true and false predictions happen. However, unlike Fidel and his colleagues, our proposed mechanism directly uses the penultimate layer’s outputs of the malicious detection metrics histories instead of their proposed XAI signatures.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Beyond our previous work just using simple DNNs like CNN, GRU, and LSTM, we utilize the advanced DNNs to enhance our IDS’s performance. Particularly, for the NIDS model, we use a variant of DeepFed model inspired by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> that combines CNN and GRU to predict malicious activity in the SDN network in the NetFlow format. For the PIDS model, we leverage the E-GraphSAGE model proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> to handle the provenance graph data parsed from the collected system log data.

<p id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">FN predictions are nearly the same pattern as TP predictions. Similarly, the same results can be found when comparing the summary explanations for TN predictions with FP predictions. The overlap between explanations for true and false predictions makes the security analyst confused and adds more burden to the analysis process in a real-world situation. To tackle this problem, we propose a method of checking decision quality shown in Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ 3.3.2 Method of decision quality checking ‣ 3.3 Explainer Module ‣ 3 The System Model of XFedHunter ‣ XFedHunter: An Explainable Federated Learning Framework for Advanced Persistent Threat Detection in SDN" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> to verify the decisions made by the explained model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In the proposed method, we first classify the input based on its prediction results into four categories in the confusion matrix <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>. That means the input will be classified into one of the following four categories: TP, FP, TN, and FN, as we defined in Section <a href="#S4.SS2" title="4.2 Performance Metrics ‣ 4 Experiments and Analysis ‣ XFedHunter: An Explainable Federated Learning Framework for Advanced Persistent Threat Detection in SDN" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.2</span></a>. From the classification, we can remove the confusion about the explanation of wrong predictions. After splitting the dataset into four subsets based on their prediction category, we fetch all the subsets above into the IDS model and extract the penultimate layer’s outputs to create a penultimate-based dataset with four classes. Finally, we will use the created dataset as a training dataset for the classifier. The reason that we decide to use the penultimate layer’s output rather than the values of the original dataset is because the neurons of this layer actually form high-level features of the original input <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 4.4.4 The evaluation for the decision quality checking method ‣ 4.4 Experimental Results ‣ 4 Experiments and Analysis ‣ XFedHunter: An Explainable Federated Learning Framework for Advanced Persistent Threat Detection in SDN" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>. With this, we can easily explore the connection between its values and model prediction.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Gilpin et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> suggested that an explanation could be evaluated based on their <em id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">interpretability</em> and <em id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">completeness</em>. Interpretability aimed to describe the internals of a system in a way that was understandable to humans and was tied to the cognition, knowledge, and biases of the user. On the other hand, completeness aims to provide an accurate description of how a system operates, but this could be challenging in the case of computer programs such as DNNs, which are not easily interpretable by humans. Due to this distinction in those objectives, it was difficult to achieve interpretability and completeness simultaneously. Therefore, in real-world situations, an explanation could obtain interpretability at the possible cost of completeness.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The Gilpin and his colleagues also suggested two evaluation methods for the explanations of deep network processing like the SHAP framework as follows: completeness compared to the original model and completeness as measured on a substitute task. However, several previous studies, including <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>, have shown that the SHAP framework, especially the two variant algorithms used to explain the predictions of our IDS models, has already demonstrated its faithfulness to the original model through these evaluation methods. Therefore, in our experiment, we opted to use the human-based evaluation method that was also described in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> to investigate the interpretability of explanations generated by the SHAP framework, especially in cases where explanations are mixed for both true and false predictions from the perspective of a domain expert.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">It is apparent from Fig. <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4.4.2 Interpretability evaluation for CNN&amp;GRU model’s predictions ‣ 4.4 Experimental Results ‣ 4 Experiments and Analysis ‣ XFedHunter: An Explainable Federated Learning Framework for Advanced Persistent Threat Detection in SDN" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> that the model classifies the predicted flow as malicious flow with a nearly perfect score of 0.993 and the L4_DST_PORT feature has a dominant effect (0.23) on the output. The top three most influential features following the L4_DST_PORT feature have positive impacts in constituting this malicious decision, while the OUT_BYTES feature has a negative impact but does not affect the prediction too much, and the other features have no or very little impact on the decision of the model. Even though the model has made a highly confident prediction suggesting that the flow is malicious, the explanation reveals that this prediction is heavily dependent on the features L4_DST_PORT and L4_SRC_PORT. However, based on our knowledge, these features hold little significance in detecting cyberattacks in real-world scenarios. This indicates that the model might have already been fitted to the dataset context and is strongly associating malicious flows with the values of the L4_DST_PORT and L4_SRC_PORT features.</p>

So that we can understand how the top features in a dataset impact the model’s output over multiple explanations. Moreover, rather than clarifying the random model’s output like other related work, we create the explanation for 4 prediction subsets based on categorical metrics (TP, FP, TN, FN). Particularly, we only extract those subsets based on predictions from CNN&amp;GRU model on the test data and each subset includes 100 samples. After that, we fetch those subsets into the beeswarm function and create the explanation shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 4.4.2 Interpretability evaluation for CNN&amp;GRU model’s predictions ‣ 4.4 Experimental Results ‣ 4 Experiments and Analysis ‣ XFedHunter: An Explainable Federated Learning Framework for Advanced Persistent Threat Detection in SDN" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. The figure displays a scatter plot where each dot represents a Shapley value for a specific feature of an instance. The features are described on the y-axis and ordered according to their average Shapley values from high to low. The x-axis indicates the Shapley value for each dot and the color reflects the corresponding value of the feature from low (blue color) to high (red color). Furthermore, the transfer from the blue to the red color demonstrates the increase in the value of the features and overlapping points jittered in the y-axis direction represent the distribution of the Shapley values per feature.</p>

Both plots give nearly the same result for the top five most influential features, but they also have some major differences. The results shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F4.sf1" title="In Figure 4 ‣ 4.4.2 Interpretability evaluation for CNN&amp;GRU model’s predictions ‣ 4.4 Experimental Results ‣ 4 Experiments and Analysis ‣ XFedHunter: An Explainable Federated Learning Framework for Advanced Persistent Threat Detection in SDN" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4a</span></a> indicate that the most influential feature (L4_DST_PORT) has a consistently positive impact on the model’s prediction with contributed values ranging from 0.15 to 0.3 and the actual value of this feature in almost all samples is in the low range. Meanwhile, the contribution of the L4_DST_PORT feature in Fig. <a href="#S4.F4.sf2" title="In Figure 4 ‣ 4.4.2 Interpretability evaluation for CNN&amp;GRU model’s predictions ‣ 4.4 Experimental Results ‣ 4 Experiments and Analysis ‣ XFedHunter: An Explainable Federated Learning Framework for Advanced Persistent Threat Detection in SDN" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4b</span></a> ranges from -0.4 to 0.1. Notably, almost all samples exhibiting high values for this feature demonstrate a stable contribution between -0.3 and -0.2. This indicates that values in this range have a considerably negative impact on the prediction of the model and make the sample more likely to be benign. However, the contribution values are stretched out by some samples having low values for this feature that maybe indicate an uncertain model decision or a decision fitted with a certain port (the cases where the contribution has a dominant impact of roughly -0.4). Based on the preceding analysis, we can see that the contribution of the L4_DST_PORT feature for the TP predictions always has a positive impact and converge in a certain range, while the contribution of the L4_DST_PORT feature for the TN predictions also has the converging range but has some unexpected values affected by the sample with low values in these features.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Similarly, in Fig. <a href="#S4.F4.sf1" title="In Figure 4 ‣ 4.4.2 Interpretability evaluation for CNN&amp;GRU model’s predictions ‣ 4.4 Experimental Results ‣ 4 Experiments and Analysis ‣ XFedHunter: An Explainable Federated Learning Framework for Advanced Persistent Threat Detection in SDN" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4a</span></a>, the contributions for the L4_SRC_PORT feature in 100 TP predictions have the same characteristics as the L4_DST_PORT feature but converge in the lower contribution range and have the value of this feature distributed in a wider range. Besides that, the contribution of the L4_SRC_PORT feature in Fig. <a href="#S4.F4.sf1" title="In Figure 4 ‣ 4.4.2 Interpretability evaluation for CNN&amp;GRU model’s predictions ‣ 4.4 Experimental Results ‣ 4 Experiments and Analysis ‣ XFedHunter: An Explainable Federated Learning Framework for Advanced Persistent Threat Detection in SDN" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4a</span></a> also has similarities with the contribution of its most important feature, but the converging contributed point is a little lower and has the opposite feature’s values compared to the most important one. The following two features in Fig. <a href="#S4.F4.sf1" title="In Figure 4 ‣ 4.4.2 Interpretability evaluation for CNN&amp;GRU model’s predictions ‣ 4.4 Experimental Results ‣ 4 Experiments and Analysis ‣ XFedHunter: An Explainable Federated Learning Framework for Advanced Persistent Threat Detection in SDN" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4a</span></a> and Fig. <a href="#S4.F4.sf2" title="In Figure 4 ‣ 4.4.2 Interpretability evaluation for CNN&amp;GRU model’s predictions ‣ 4.4 Experimental Results ‣ 4 Experiments and Analysis ‣ XFedHunter: An Explainable Federated Learning Framework for Advanced Persistent Threat Detection in SDN" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4b</span></a> are the only two features that have different positions in the top five most influential features. Moreover, a relationship between them becomes apparent when comparing these features side by side. Particularly, the OUT_BYTES feature has a negative impact on the prediction for samples with high values in this feature and a positive impact on samples with low values. However, for TP predictions, the contributions of OUT_BYTES heavily converge with the samples having high values of this feature, whereas for TN predictions, the contributions converge with samples having low and medium values. Furthermore, although TP and TN samples have low values in the OUT_PKT feature, the contributions for this feature have contrary effects in each case: a positive impact for TP predictions and a negative impact for TN predictions. Similarly, we can analyze the remaining features to explore the relationship between TP and TN predictions and provide insight into how each feature affects the model’s decision.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">However, there are similar patterns when comparing the summary explanations for FN predictions and FP predictions shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F4.sf3" title="In Figure 4 ‣ 4.4.2 Interpretability evaluation for CNN&amp;GRU model’s predictions ‣ 4.4 Experimental Results ‣ 4 Experiments and Analysis ‣ XFedHunter: An Explainable Federated Learning Framework for Advanced Persistent Threat Detection in SDN" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4c</span></a> and Fig. <a href="#S4.F4.sf4" title="In Figure 4 ‣ 4.4.2 Interpretability evaluation for CNN&amp;GRU model’s predictions ‣ 4.4 Experimental Results ‣ 4 Experiments and Analysis ‣ XFedHunter: An Explainable Federated Learning Framework for Advanced Persistent Threat Detection in SDN" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4d</span></a> with those for TP predictions and TN predictions. This indicates that malicious samples having similar data distributions to benign samples make our model confused and classify these samples as benign. The same conclusion can also be drawn for benign samples. From our knowledge, these confusions are understandable when put into a real-world scenario. For DoS attack instances, which we also know exist in our dataset, the DoS attack occurs when there is an enormous network flow overrun in our network. Therefore, the attack is concluded as happening or not depending on the amount of flow data and particular system. However, as in almost all research out there, we classify a model prediction as malicious if it is above a defined threshold (usually 0.5), which may not be the correct measurement threshold in all cases. Besides the above reasons, those confusions may also indicate a mislabeling in the experiment dataset or even be a signal for an adversarial attack.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p7.1" class="ltx_p">In summary, the analysis conducted above enables us to comprehend the features that have the most significant contribution to the model’s decision-making process through the single explanation provided by the SHAP framework. Furthermore, the summary explanations generated not only revealed the relationship between each feature’s contribution and the mean of feature values, but also highlighted the similarities and contrasts between the contributions for each feature depicted in those plots. Moreover, we can see from the above analysis that although the model gives excellent performance, as evidenced by the result in TABLE <a href="#S4.T5" title="Table 5 ‣ 4.4.1 Detection evaluation ‣ 4.4 Experimental Results ‣ 4 Experiments and Analysis ‣ XFedHunter: An Explainable Federated Learning Framework for Advanced Persistent Threat Detection in SDN" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, the model’s decision mainly relies on the two most important features, L4_DST_PORT and L4_SRC_PORT, which may be inappropriate in a real-world context. These settings can be easily evaded, especially in an APT attack where the stealth is highly valued.</p>

<div id="S4.SS4.SSS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There are differences in the explanation for a prediction of the GNN model, specifically our E-GraphSAGE model, when compared with the CNN&amp;GRU model discussed earlier. Instead of focusing on important features of the predicted edge, the modern graph explanation method focuses on determining which node and which edge are more important than the others. This methodology is based on the knowledge that the prediction of an edge would depend on the attributes of the nodes and edges surrounding it, and farther nodes and edges would have less impact than those having a closer distance. Because of this taxonomy, rather than computing the importance score for each node and edge, a more effective explanation is achieved by determining the importance score of the nodes and edges in the sub-graph surrounding the predicted edge. By centering the node that has the highest importance score next to the predicted edge (the source node or the destination node), we can generate a node-centered sub-graph explanation, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 4.4.3 Interpretability evaluation for E-GraphSAGE model’s predictions ‣ 4.4 Experimental Results ‣ 4 Experiments and Analysis ‣ XFedHunter: An Explainable Federated Learning Framework for Advanced Persistent Threat Detection in SDN" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>. The figure provides the explanation for a benign prediction edge (red color edge). Each node is labeled with its important score and the score is calculated by the sum of all feature contributions measured by GradientSHAP of that node and is scaled into [0, 1] by dividing with the highest importance score of the node in the sub-graph. Furthermore, the transformation from light blue to dark blue in the nodes of the sub-graph indicates the increase in the value of the features. Each edge is labeled with its actual class (0 is benign and 1 is malicious) and its important score is calculated similarly to the important score of a node.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS4.SSS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.SSS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">It is apparent from the Fig. <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 4.4.3 Interpretability evaluation for E-GraphSAGE model’s predictions ‣ 4.4 Experimental Results ‣ 4 Experiments and Analysis ‣ XFedHunter: An Explainable Federated Learning Framework for Advanced Persistent Threat Detection in SDN" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> that the center node has a dominant effect in this sub-graph. Moreover, it is worth noting that not only our predicted edge but also the other edges that are around the center node are labeled as benign and have the same important score of 1.0, indicating the center node has a negative impact on predictions for edges around it. To better understand the explanation, we remap node and edge features to their original values. The original value for the center node is <em id="S4.SS4.SSS3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">A “file” node has the subtype of “dir”</em> and the other nodes are <em id="S4.SS4.SSS3.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">A “subject” node has the subtype of “process”</em> and <em id="S4.SS4.SSS3.p2.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">An “modify_process” edge executed the “imapd” program</em> is the original value for all edges in the sub-graph. From the explanation and reversed values, we can conclude that the imapd program is decisively classified as benign by our models. In fact, in our experiment dataset, any events associated with the imapd program are labeled as benign events, so we can rely on the generated explanation to interpret the prediction of E-GraphSAGE model.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.SSS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">For the classifier that is used to measure the reliability of the prediction based on the penultimate-based dataset, we simply compute the average distance between the examined instance and instances in each class in the penultimate-based dataset. Then, the examined prediction is assigned to the class with the smallest average distance. We opt to use the average distance calculation method in our classifier because of the lack of samples for the FP and FN classes in our test dataset, although there are many samples for the TP and TN classes. Particularly for the GRU&amp;CNN model, we only have 300 samples for the FP class and 183 samples for the FN class in our test data. To maintain class balance, we decided to create a training dataset consisting of 400 samples and a test dataset consisting of 360 samples, with the samples in these datasets equally divided among each class. The leak of FP and FN samples is even worse for the E-GraphSAGE model, so we just have a training dataset with a size of 160 samples (50 TP samples, 50 FP samples, 50 TN samples, and 10 FN samples) and a test dataset consisting of 96 samples (30 TP samples, 30 FP samples, 30 TN samples, and 6 FN samples). Due to the small size of the created datasets, we should not use too sophisticated methods, causing unnecessary computation and decreasing the classification performance. Despite the aforementioned limitations, our approach still achieves an impressive accuracy of approximately 0.9188 in the case of the CNN&amp;GRU model, but the accuracy in the case of the E-GraphSAGE model is lower at 0.8557.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In conclusion, this paper proposes a novel explainable federated learning framework for Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) detection in Software-Defined Networking (SDN). The proposed framework, called XFedHunter, leverages local cyber threat knowledge from many training collaborators to detect and predict APT indicators and provide explanations for the ML predictions. Our framework can help cybersecurity domain experts verify the correctness of predictions from APT detectors with lesser burden through SHAP framework and a mechanism of checking model decisions on false negative and false positive cases. The experimental results on the NF-ToN-IoT and DARPA TCE3 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in enhancing the trust and accountability of ML-based systems utilized for cybersecurity purposes without privacy leakage.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The proposed XFedHunter framework addresses the challenges of APT attacks by providing explainable ML predictions to reveal the characteristics of attackers lurking in the network system. The framework also leverages the advantages of federated learning to enable effective collaborative learning while preserving data privacy. Overall, our work provides valuable insights and a practical solution for building robust and secure ML-based systems for APT detection in SDN environments. Our findings can inform future research and development of explainable federated learning frameworks for cybersecurity applications. In the future, we intend to investigate the feasibility of XAI to defend against certain adversarial attacks on deep neural networks in the context of cyberattack and malware detection.</p>
