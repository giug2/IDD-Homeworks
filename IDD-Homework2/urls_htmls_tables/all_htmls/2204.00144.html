<p id="id1.1" class="ltx_p">Attacks on computer networks have increased significantly in recent days,
due in part to the availability of sophisticated tools for launching such
attacks as well as thriving underground cyber-crime economy to
support it. Over the past several years, researchers in academia and
industry used machine learning (ML) techniques to design and implement
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes) for computer networks. Many of these researchers used datasets
collected by various organizations to train ML models for predicting
intrusions. In many of the datasets used in such systems, data are
imbalanced (i.e., not all classes have equal amount of samples). With
unbalanced data, the predictive models developed using ML algorithms
may produce unsatisfactory classifiers which would affect accuracy in
predicting intrusions. Traditionally, researchers used over-sampling
and under-sampling for balancing data in datasets to overcome this
problem. In this
work, in addition to over-sampling, we also use a synthetic data
generation method, called Conditional Generative Adversarial Network
(CTGAN), to balance data and study their effect on various ML
classifiers. To the best of our knowledge, no one else has used CTGAN
to generate synthetic samples to balance intrusion detection datasets. Based on extensive
experiments using a widely used dataset NSL-KDD, we found that
training ML models on dataset balanced
with synthetic samples generated by CTGAN
increased prediction accuracy by up to <math id="id1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="8\%" display="inline"><semantics id="id1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="id1.1.m1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="id1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">8</mn><mo id="id1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.2">8</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id1.1.m1.1c">8\%</annotation></semantics></math>, compared to training

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There has been a significant increase in the number of intrusions into computer networks over the past few years due in part to sophisticated tools to launch such attacks as well as a thriving underground economy to support such attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
According to a 2017 report <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, data breaches cost an average of $141 per record.
It is estimated that 60% of small businesses that suffer a data breach will cease operations within six months.
Symantec’s Internet Security Threat Report for 2017 indicated that
the number and intensity of attacks were significantly higher than those in previous years <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> – zero-day attacks totaled more than three billion in 2016.
Traditional tools such as firewalls
can not cope with these sophisticated attacks. In order to fight
network intrusions, hardware and software tools can be
installed to continuously monitor the network.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">James Anderson
published a report on the need for detecting network intrusions in
computer systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> in
1972 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Since then, several intrusion
detection systems (IDSes) have been proposed and implemented.
These systems can be further classified as
host-based, network-based, and hybrid <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. System
architectures can be centralized, distributed, or hybrid, based on how
intrusion/attack events are collected, processed, and acted
upon. Certain approaches are superior to others based on factors such
as cost, performance, and other metrics.
These systems can be further classified based on the
techniques used for intrusion detection – signature-based or
anomaly-based. A Signature-based IDS detects attacks based on
the signatures of previously known attacks. These IDSs cannot detect
zero-day attacks.
In contrast, anomaly-based IDSes are capable of detecting zero-day attacks by modeling users’ behaviors.
In the training phase of an anomaly-based
approach, legitimate users’ behaviors are first collected and analyzed in order
to build a model of legitimate users’ behavior. The model is
then used to determine whether
the current observed behavior is that of legitimate user or not. Some methods used for such
classification are <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>: <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Statistical
approach</span>: classification is based on univariate, multivariate, or
time-series models. <span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Knowledge based approach</span>: expert system is
used to model legitimate behavior according to a set of rules. <span id="S1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Machine learning based approach</span>: automatically classified based
on some clustering algorithms. However, anomaly-based IDSes often
generate more false positives and signature-based IDSes generally
generate more false negatives.</p>

ML models show poor performance on imbalanced datasets – no matter what type of machine learning model is employed. Synthetic data generation for minority classes can overcome the data imbalance issue, thus may yield improved classification performance of ML models.

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">ML based IDSes have been extensively studied in the literature.
For example, following ML approaches have been
tested by various researchers for intrusion detection: Artificial
Neural Networks, Association Rules and Fuzzy Association Rules,
Bayesian Networks, Clustering, Decision Trees, Evolutionary
Computation, Hidden Markov Models, Inductive Learning, Naïve Bayes,
Sequential Pattern Mining, and Support Vector
Machine <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
In many
of the datasets used in such studies, data are not balanced.
That is,
instances of one class surpass those of another
class <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. The classes that have a high frequency of
instances are called majority classes, while the classes that have a
low frequency of instances are called minority classes. The ratio of samples
between a minority class and
those of
in a majority class may be
as small as 1:100, or as large as
1:1000, or even larger <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Effect of Balancing Data Using Synthetic Data on the Performance of Machine Learning Classifiers for Intrusion Detection in Computer Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> highlights that imbalance in the dataset may result in poor
performance of ML classifiers. Many of
the researchers have (i) ignored this problem, (ii) balanced data
using over-sampling (e.g., by randomly replicating
minority class samples) or under-sampling (e.g., by randomly eliminating
majority class samples) techniques. Over-sampling and under-sampling
help in balancing data. However, since the new
samples added under over-sampling are exact copies of the original
samples, it may cause overfitting. Similarly, since
random data are eliminated from majority classes in under-sampling, the dataset may
become too simple, with the same number of features and too little data to build
an effective model, resulting in underfitting problem.
In general, an overfit model has low bias and high variance, while an underfit model has high bias and low variance.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, to study the effect of balancing data on the
performance of ML classifiers, we use
(i) the most commonly used random over-sampling, and (ii) synthetic
data generated using the Conditional Generative Adversarial Network
(CTGAN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> for balancing data.
CTGAN exploits a conditional generative adversarial network, learns
from input data (i.e., both discrete and continuous features), and
generates high-fidelity synthetic samples. We generate synthetic
samples for all classes after training CTGAN on the training
dataset. By discarding samples of the majority classes and keeping
samples of the minority classes, we eliminate the data imbalance
issue. It is important to emphasize that the new synthetic samples
generated by CTGAN are not copies of the instances in the original
dataset but look-alike instances.
To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first time CTGAN has been used to generate
synthetic data for balancing data related to intrusion
detection.</p>

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">We studied the effect of synthetic data generation
approaches on
the performance of various state-of-the-art ML classifiers through extensive
experiments. We also compare how various ML classifiers perform
on the original dataset.
We use NSL-KDD (Network Socket Layer-Knowledge Discovery in Database) dataset in our experiments –
a widely used dataset for
studying intrusion detection. Specifically, we use the following
state-of-the-art ML classifiers for conducting the experiments:
Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF),
Naive Bayes (NB), Feed Forward Network (FNN), Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Our focus is on
multi-class classification rather than binary classification – a challenging problem setup. A
multiclass classification makes it possible to evaluate the
performances of various models relative to different types of intrusions.
Our experimental results show that on the NSL-KDD dataset, with data
balanced using the synthetic data generated by CTGAN, some of the
ML classifiers show an increase in prediction accuracy by as much

have fewer instances). There are several methods to overcome the
imbalance problem, such as oversampling, undersampling, stratified

A DT is tree structure, in which each leaf node represents
a class label and each internal node is a decision node or a chance
node <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. DT constructs a tree by segmenting the
feature space into several subregions. Hence, tree is constructed by
recursively binary splitting of the feature space <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
Two splitting methods are usually used to split the tree (e.g., cross
entropy, gini index). We used gini index-based
splitting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. Gini index can be calculated using

<p id="S2.SS4.SSS3.p1.8" class="ltx_p">NB classifiers are a family of probabilistic classifiers
based on Bayes’ Theorem. NB classifiers, combined with kernel
density estimation, can achieve high accuracy levels.
NB is widely used by researchers to solve various classification
problems that arise in their
research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>.
NB classifier is based on conditional
probability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. The probability of one attribute
does not affect another attribute, given the class label. Therefore, the presence of a
attribute in a class is unrelated to any other attribute. The Naive
Bayes can be written as</p>

RF combines multiple decision trees to make more accurate, stable
predictions. It builds a decision forest based on several decision
trees usually trained with the bagging method. A bagging method,
based on the concept that combining different learning models,
increases overall performance. In our approach, we used the Gini Index

Convolutions
are used in this neural network to transform the input features into
meaningful information, which is then used to build the subsequent
layers of neural network computations. The convolutional layer is used
to extract features, to perform linear operations, and is usually a
combined convolution. In convolution, multiple kernels or filters are
used. A convolutional operation is usually defined as:</p>

However, the precision for CTGANSamp is not as good as it is for ORG or RndOSamp for SVM and NB classifiers. Additionally, the experimental results we obtain also show that
accuracy of some classifiers decrease under RndOSamp compared to
their accuracy under ORG. Overall, it can be conclusively claimed that all the classifiers show significant improvement for various metrics on both datasets. Under CTGANSamp, in the following, we further discuss quantitative results</p>

In Figure <a href="#S3.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 3.5 Results ‣ 3 Experimental Results ‣ Effect of Balancing Data Using Synthetic Data on the Performance of Machine Learning Classifiers for Intrusion Detection in Computer Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, we mark five circles (i.e., classes or clusters) shown in
blue (I), green (II), black (III), purple (IV), and red (V) colors. We
can see that the classification based on CTGANSamp is much
closer to the actual truth.
The blue circle in the ground truth indicates that the majority of the samples are of the DoS class type. In the same circle, ORG performs very well and is in line with the truth. The RndOSamp, on the other hand, predicts the opposite of the truth. CTGAN has incorrectly predicted some DoS samples as normal in the same circle, but overall it is able to detect most of the DoS samples. The majority of the samples in the green circle of ground truth are normal, and only a few are U2R, R2L, and probe samples. ORG is not able to detect any of the U2R and R2L samples, and some of the normal samples are also labeled as probes. Among all the experiments on this circle, RndOSamp performs the worst. It label many normal samples as probes. CTGANSamp, on the other hand, detects all the normal samples along with the minority classes U2R and R2L. In the black circle of the ground truth, the majority of the samples are probes, where ORG and RndOSamp predict all the samples to be normal. CTGAN’s prediction, on the other hand, is similar to the ground truth. It is also the case with the purple and red circles, where CTGANSamp’s prediction results are the same as the actual results. In contrast, both ORG and RndOSamp fail to capture the actual truth for the same circles.</p>

<p id="S3.SS5.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, we also perform statistical significant test on KDDTest+, Student’s T-test, on
these three experiments to check if there is any significant
difference and P-values are presented in table <a href="#S3.T5" title="Table 5 ‣ 3.5 Results ‣ 3 Experimental Results ‣ Effect of Balancing Data Using Synthetic Data on the Performance of Machine Learning Classifiers for Intrusion Detection in Computer Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>. We notice that the P-values are consistently very small
when we compare the performance of CTGANSamp with ORG and RndOSamp. On
the other hand, P-values for ORG and RndOSamp are not always small
(for example, the P-value of RF is <math id="S3.SS5.p5.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="0.91" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS5.p5.1.m1.1a"><mn id="S3.SS5.p5.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS5.p5.1.m1.1.1.cmml">0.91</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS5.p5.1.m1.1b"><cn type="float" id="S3.SS5.p5.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS5.p5.1.m1.1.1">0.91</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS5.p5.1.m1.1c">0.91</annotation></semantics></math>). This result also signifies that ML classifiers show improvement when they were trained using dataset augmented with CTGAN.</p>

ANN, SVM, and DT in their study. The primary goal of this study was
to determine the optimal machine learning technique. As part of their experiments, they used 60% and 70% of
the dataset NSL-KDD for training, and the rest of the dataset for

distinguish between normal network traffic and attack traffic. Shone <span id="S4.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">63</span></a>]</cite> studied the feasibility and
sustainability of current approaches in network intrusion
detection. Deep
and shallow learning were combined in their model. For unsupervised
feature learning, the authors applied two layers of non-symmetric deep
auto-encoders (NDAE). Unlike conventional auto encoders, the NDAE
contains no decoder. In order to perform the final classification of
the network traffic into normal and attack, RF was used. Based on
NSL-KDD and KDD99 datasets, the authors evaluated their model using
five and thirteen layers of classification. To overcome the problem of
over-fitting and under-fitting, they performed a 10-fold cross
validation. Due to the imbalanced nature of the datasets, the false
alarm rate was high in some attack classes.</p>

transform categorical data to numerical values during the
preprocessing stage. In the following step, min-max method was used to
normalize the dataset due to large variations in the data
distribution. To classify data, recurrent neural networks (RNNs)
with forward propagation and backward propagation were used. In the
forward propagation method, output values were calculated, and the
backward propagation method calculated the error and updated the
weights. Cross-entropy was used to compute the difference between the
output values produced by forward propagation and the true
value. Using this methodology, both binary and multiclass
classification were performed.</p>

Lastly, a deep neural network classifier was trained with the augmented data set to forecast emerging technologies, and it was able to accurately predict up to <math id="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="77\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">77</mn><mo id="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.2">77</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1c">77\%</annotation></semantics></math> of the emerging technologies in a given year. Based on patent data from 2000-2016, this approach was used to predict emerging technologies in Gartner’s hype cycles for 2017. A total of four out of six emerging technologies were accurately predicted, demonstrating the precision and accuracy of the proposed method. This article showed that deep learning now can be used to forecast emerging technologies with limited training samples.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Over the past several years, many researchers used Machine Learning in
designing and implementing IDSes. They used different datasets for
training ML classifiers. Some of the datasets used in such works are:
NSL-KDD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">52</span></a>]</cite>,

2017 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib71" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">71</span></a>]</cite>,
In many of the datasets used for designing IDSes, data are
imbalanced (i.e., not all classes have equal amount of data). With
unbalanced data, the predictive models developed using ML algorithms
may produce unsatisfactory classifiers which would affect accuracy in
predicting intrusions. Traditionally, researchers used over-sampling
and under-sampling techniques to balance data in datasets. In this
work, we use over-sampling, and also use a synthetic data
generation method, called Conditional Generative Adversarial Network
(CTGAN) to balance data and study their effect on various ML
classifiers. To the best of our knowledge, no one else has used CTGAN
to generate synthetic samples to balance datasets designed for
intrusion detection in computer networks. Based on extensive
experiments with the widely used dataset NSL-KDD, we found that
training ML models on data balanced
with synthetic samples generated by CTGAN
increased prediction accuracy by as much as <math id="S5.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="8\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">8</mn><mo id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">8</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1c">8\%</annotation></semantics></math>, compared to training
the same ML models over unbalanced data. Our experiments also show
that the accuracy of some ML models trained over data balanced with
random over-sampling declined compared to the same ML models trained over
unbalanced data.</p>
