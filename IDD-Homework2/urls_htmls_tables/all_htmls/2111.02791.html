<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">The uses of Machine Learning (ML) technologies in the detection of network attacks have been proven to be effective when designed and evaluated in a single organisation. However, it has been very challenging to design an ML-based detection system by utilising heterogeneous network data samples originating from several sources. This is mainly due to privacy concerns and the lack of a universal format of datasets. In this paper, we propose a collaborative federated learning scheme to address these issues. The proposed framework allows multiple organisations to join forces in the design, training, and evaluation of a robust ML-based network intrusion detection system. The threat intelligence scheme utilises two critical aspects for its application; the availability of network data traffic in a common format to allow for the extraction of meaningful patterns across data sources. Secondly, the adoption of a federated learning mechanism to avoid the necessity of sharing sensitive users’ information between organisations. As a result, each organisation benefits from other organisations cyber threat intelligence while maintaining the privacy of its data internally/ The model is trained locally and only the updated weights are shared with the remaining participants in the federated averaging process. The framework has been designed and evaluated in this paper by using two key datasets in a NetFlow format known as NF-UNSW-NB15-v2 and NF-BoT-IoT-v2. Two other common scenarios are considered in the evaluation process; a centralised training method where the local data samples are shared with other organisations and a localised training method where no threat intelligence is shared. The results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed framework by designing a universal ML model effectively classifying benign and intrusive traffic originating from multiple organisations without the need for local data exchange.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) are tools used to detect intrusive network traffic as they penetrate a digital computer network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. They aim to preserve the three key principles of information security; confidentiality, integrity, and availability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. NIDS scan and analyse the incoming traffic for any malicious indicators that may present a threat or harm to the target network. There are two main types of NIDS; 1) signature-based NIDS, which operates by scanning for a set of previously known attack rules or Indicators Of Compromise (IOC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> such as source/destination IPs and ports, hash values or domain names in an incoming network feed. This traditional method works efficiently against known attack scenarios where the complete set of IOC has been previously identified and registered within the NIDS. However, signature-based NIDSs have been vulnerable to zero-day attacks where there is a lack of knowledge of the IOCs related to the occurrence of the activity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. In addition, the detection of modern advanced and persistent threats such as Cobalt Strike <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> requires a sophisticated depth of behavioural change monitoring <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, where the usage of traditional IOC is not sufficient in their detection. Therefore, the focus of NIDS development has shifted towards the modern type of NIDS with enhanced Machine Learning (ML) capabilities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">ML is an emerging branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) extensively used with great success to empower decision making systems across various domains <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. ML models operate by extracting and learning meaningful patterns from historical data during the design process. The models then apply the learnt semantics to classify or predict unseen data samples into their respective classes or values. The intelligence capability of ML has motivated its usage in many industries to provide a deeper level of analysis to automate and assist in complex decision-making tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. ML enhances the performance and efficiency of hosting systems without being explicitly programmed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> by learning complex patterns that are not trivial to recognize by domain experts. As such, ML has been welcomed in the development of NIDS to overcome the limitations faced by signature-based NIDS and to improve the detection of cyberattacks using an intelligent layer of defence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. ML-based NIDS capabilities have been widely adopted in the security of modern computer networks to detect zero-day and advanced cyber threats. ML models are capable of learning the distinguishing semantic patterns between intrusive and benign network traffic and using it to detect any incoming traffic with malicious intent. Therefore, the focus on the network attacks’ behavioural patterns and the lack of dependency of identified IOC to detect attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> has attracted attention towards the development of ML-based NIDS.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The development phase of ML-based NIDS generally involves two key stages <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>; the learning stage where the designed ML model learns the semantic patterns from intrusive and benign traffic, followed by a testing stage where the model classifies unseen data into either unsafe or safe classes. Standard ML techniques usually follow either a localised or a centralised learning method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. A localised learning method involves local data samples collected from a single endpoint, the learning and testing occur locally on the endpoint <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, where it is generally more effective with a larger amount of data. This method often provides a high detection accuracy over Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> data samples with a similar probability distribution to the local data samples. However, as network traffic is often heterogeneous in nature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> due to a multitude of safe applications/services and malicious threats/intrusions, localised training approaches do not scale well with the rapidly increasing and changing world traffic <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. This is mainly due to the fact that the learning model is exposed to a limited variety of network traffic scenarios, hence it has a limited experience of other instances. As a result, modern research works have adopted centralised learning methods to overcome some of the limitations faced by localised approaches.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Centralised learning is widely proposed in the academic field where local data samples are collected from various endpoints and transmitted to a central server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. The central entity holds all data samples ideally representing an overall representation of the organisation’s Standard Operating Environment (SOE) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> and a large number of attack scenarios. The learning and testing stages are conducted on the central server where the learning models experience and extract useful patterns from heterogeneous network traffic. Therefore, enabling NIDSs to effectively detect network intrusions across non-IID data samples <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. This method generally achieves a reliable detection performance across the various endpoints of an organisation. However, centralised learning requires the direct sharing of data samples between endpoints and a central entity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. This presents serious privacy and security concerns due to the nature of the data transmitted. Network data often contain sensitive information related to users’ browsing sessions, applications and services utilised, often revealing critical endpoint details. As a result, a new and active research area known as federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> has been utilised to overcome the privacy concerns of centralised learning methods.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is an advanced technique of ML designed to address certain limitations of traditional ML. A federated learning setup allows for training a learning model across multiple decentralised endpoints, holding local data samples without exchanging them <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. The key benefit of following a federated learning approach is preserving and maintaining the privacy and security of local data samples as they are no longer shared with other entities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. In addition, due to a lack of a central entity storing all data samples, there is lower latency, power and storage requirements due to the reduced transmission of data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. This is often a motivation for usage in IoT networks where federated learning has been widely adopted <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. In the context of NIDS, this enables the design of smarter ML models as they are exposed to a large number of heterogeneous data samples generated using various endpoints while ensuring the privacy of network users <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. Federated learning approaches generally begins a global sever initiating an ML model. Each participating local client downloads a copy of the global model locally and improves it by conducting a learning process using the local data samples. Finally, the set of trained model’s parameters is uploaded back to the global server where it is aggregated with each set of received parameters to improve the global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, this presents a single federated learning round and can be repeated several times to reach a desirable performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we take the application of machine learning a step further, where each local client is observed as a single organisation with a unique network of heterogeneous endpoints. While this attracts a great number of benefits, it also raises certain challenges which we address in this paper. The proposed federated learning methodology allows multiple organisations to share Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> to collaboratively and securely design an effective ML-based NIDS. This increases the exposure of the NIDS model to a multitude of network traffic scenarios including various benign SOEs and malicious attack scenarios occurring in different organisational networks. This is an important aspect of a real-world implementation as it causes each network to have its unique statistical distribution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> that ML models performance might not generalise across. Unlike centralised learning approaches, federated learning enables the collaboration between organisations to design shared ML-based NIDSs while keeping the privacy of their local data preserved. Decoupling the ability to learn from other organisations’ network intelligence and attack experiences from the need to directly share sensitive data. Similarly to the traditional federated learning methodology, a single global organisation is required to orchestrate the whole process by initiating a global ML model. Each participating organisation downloads a copy of the global model locally, and trains it using its local data samples internally and uploads the updated parameters back to the global organisation. The global organisation receives the trained parameters from each participant and aggregates them to improve the global model before sending it back to each organisation for usage. This presents a single federared learning round and can be repeated across all participants to reach a reliable state of performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">The outcome of the proposed method is a common and robust ML-based NIDS not limited to per a single organisation experience and available local training samples. The enhanced model is trained on heterogeneous data collected over a variety of non-IID networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, each presenting its unique behaviour of benign and a wide range of different attacks. In addition, the training data remains secure and preserved internally within each organisation perimeters without the explicit exchange of data samples. The key contributions of this paper are the proposal of a novel privacy-preserving cyber threat intelligence scheme and the evaluation of its performance using two key NIDS datasets. The results are analysed and compared to centralised and localised use cases to demonstrate the effectiveness of the scheme.

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A large number of research papers have aimed to adopt a federated learning approach in the design of ML-based NIDS. While most papers, focused on the structure and parameters of the adopted learning model, all of the training and evaluation stages were conducted using a single organisational network data split over several local endpoints. Therefore, the data samples used in the learning model are not very different in nature as they all originate within the same network. To the best of our knowledge, no paper has considered the requirements of designing an ML-based NIDS using several heterogeneous data sources collected across multiple non-IID networks. This framework is to be ideally used to provide a collaborative CTI mechanism to organisations without the direct sharing of sensitive data. The outcome would be a model capable of distinguishing between several benign traffic and malicious attack behaviours. A centralised ML technique requires the exchange of data between organisations which is very challenging due to the security and privacy aspects. Therefore, the collaborative scheme requires to be conducted in a federated learning manner to achieve the same outcome without the need of sharing data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, Abdul Rahman et al. evaluated the detection performance of a NIDS designed in a centralised, on-device, and federated learning use case. In a centralised scenario a single entity stores and performs analysis on data collected across multiple devices. The on-device use case is a self-learning technique where a single device analyses its local data samples. The comparison was conducted using safe and malicious network data samples in the NSL-KDD dataset. The results show that federated learning outperforms the on-device learning method and achieves a similar detection performance in a centralised manner while maintaining the privacy of local data samples.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Mothukuri et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> explored different parameters of a federated learning-based anomaly detection approach to detect IoT intrusions using decentralised on-device data. The paper explored two deep learning models; Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) with various window sizes and an additional Random Forest ensemble component to combine the predictions from different layers. The evaluation was conducted on the Modbus-based dataset which consists of benign IoT telemetry traffic and four attack scenarios. The results show that their approach outperformed the centralised ML approach with a minimised error detection rate and reduced the number of false alarms.</p>

<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In paper <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, Popoola et al. proposed a deep neural network model to detect zero-day botnet traffic with a high classification performance. By following a federated learning approach, the method guarantees to preserve data privacy and security, in addition, it has a lower communication overhead, network latency and memory space for storage of training data. The paper explored sixteen DNN models to determine the optimal neural architecture for efficient classification. The traditional FedAvg algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> is used for the aggregation of local model parameters. The performance of the federated learning methodology in the detection of zero-day botnet attacks is compared with centralised and localised methods where the federated learning achieves similar performance to the centralised method while preserving data privacy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Overall, recent research works have addressed different aspects of the federated learning process, which is an active research area, such as communication cost, privacy, security, and resource allocation. However, each endpoint utilised is holding a set of local data samples that represent a similar distribution to the overall data. These approaches may not scale well with the rapid growth of network attacks that may compromise organisational networks. In the real world, the local network data samples in each organisation are unique in their statistical distribution depending on the organisations SOE and the types of malicious threats faced. Therefore, different datasets with non-IID samples are required to simulate a federated learning approach across multiple organisations. Therefore, we aim in this work to investigate the applicability of collaborative CTI sharing based on federated learning for network intrusion detection.</p>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Data is considered the most valuable and powerful tool that an organisation might own in the 21st century. A lot of organisations in many sectors depend on data to provide insights and extract meaningful patterns through analytical engines. ML has provided organisations with intelligent algorithms able of extracting and learning semantic attributes from historical data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> to provide insights into the prediction or classification of future data. As such, ML capabilities have been adopted in the design of NIDSs to monitor and preserve the digital perimeters of organisations’ networks. To achieve this goal, network data traffic has been captured from organisational networks to design an ML model. During the training process, the model learns the distinguishing patterns between benign and intrusive traffic which can be used in future detection. ML-based NIDS has been proven to be reliable in the detection of zero-day and modern attacks by utilising the malicious behaviour and attack chains rather than a set of IOCs implemented in signature-based NIDS.</p>

<section id="S3.SS1" class="ltx_subsection">
<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">3.1 </span>Motivation</h3>

<div id="S3.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A large number of research work has been conducted to improve the overall performance of ML-based NIDS. Current traditional systems have generally been designed in a localised ML manner where models learn traffic patterns from a single network source. This method provides the learning model with high visibility into a target organisational network’s SOE activities, and malicious threats encountered in the past. However, as an ML model only knows what it learns, traditional ML-based NIDS are limited to per an organisation experience independently and might be incapable to generalise across non-IID network sources. There is a high chance of varying distributions in different networks due to the unique SOEs and their associated threats implemented within organisations. This presents a significant risk to organisations due to the rapidly changing network environments caused by modern work practices such as new services or an incoming advanced threat such as zero-day attacks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Therefore, the current method of ML-based NIDS design does not scale with the rapid growth of network benign and attack variants as there is a requirement to collect each scenario in the target organisation. We utilise the change of networks as a baseline in our experiments, i.e., when an ML model is trained on one network source and evaluated on a different network. This measures how well a learning model generalises across other networks. Another key limitation of current approaches is the requirement to collect a large amount of training data samples to increase the performance and generalisation of the ML model and avoid overfitting over a few data samples <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. Therefore, particularly in the design of ML-based NIDS, following a supervised method adopted in this paper, a large number of labelled benign and attack data samples are required. The lack of labelled training data is a major challenge for small organisations aiming to effectively design an intrusion detection model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the lack of shared intelligence, organisations can not benefit from the patterns of safe application or malicious intrusions occurring in other organisations. Therefore, a collaborative ML approach between organisations is necessary for the design of enhanced NIDS. The three ML scenarios are considered for this purpose where the traditional endpoints are replaced with organisations. The localised learning method is inapplicable as it involves a single source of organisational data. This is used for comparison purposes in this paper as a non-collaborative scenario where an organisation does not share intelligence. The centralised learning scenario requires a direct sharing of data between organisations and a central entity to allow for the training of an ML model. This method enables the learning model to extract useful patterns from various data samples collected over the participating organisational networks to overcome the issues faced in the localised learning scenario.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">However, network data often present sensitive information such as user browsing sessions, applications accessed and critical endpoint details, e.g. domain controllers. Therefore, following a centralised learning approach poses privacy, security, and transactional risks that organisations would generally avoid. Moreover, recent strict laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> are enforced to protect consumers data privacy and address concerns related to unauthorised sharing of user-related information. The violation of privacy conserving regulations often presents serious legal concerns and hefty fines of up to $20million <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> in the case of a GDPR breach. Unfortunately, centralised learning requires a central entity to collect, store and analyse network data samples collected from participating organisations, which could make it unfeasible to conduct in the real world.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">It is important to note that the sharing of CTI is not uncommon in the security field. In fact, many organisations using signature-based NIDS heavily rely on CTI platforms, such as Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> a widely-used open-source platform. CTI platforms develop utilities and documentation for more effective threat intelligence by the sharing of IOCs related to external threat actors. Organisations generally integrate an intelligence feed with their traditional signature-based NIDS to provide a high detection accuracy against the associated attacks. However, in ML-based NIDS, the sharing of attack data samples might include revealing information related to the targeted user, endpoint or application depending on the attributes provided.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To overcome the previously mentioned limitations, CTI sharing between organisations via a federated learning approach is required to increase the knowledge base of the learning models while maintaining the privacy of user information. The three learning scenarios are illustrated in Figure <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 3.2 Collaborative Federated Learning ‣ 3 Cyber Threat Intelligence Sharing ‣ A Cyber Threat Intelligence Sharing Scheme based on Federated Learning for Network Intrusion Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. The learning model is exposed to a wider range of benign and attack variants in order to achieve reliable detection accuracy across previously unseen traffic in a given organisation. The proposed framework allows organisations to join forces by sharing their cyber intelligence and insights. In addition, organisations that do not collect and store a sufficient amount of network traffic required for the training of a learning model are now able to design an effective ML-based by collaborating with other organisations. As each participant contributing with a minimum amount of data samples would permit the design of a successful system, our approach tackles the data scarcity problem and makes it possible to design an ML-based NIDS without the need to collect a large amount of training data.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, by adopting a federated learning approach, the local network data samples remain distributed internally across the organisations, hence persevering the privacy and integrity of sensitive users’ network information. A federated learning setup includes a global server that coordinates and orchestrates the independent training of the local models. In this paper the global server is hosted within a participant organisation, however, this framework enables it to be hosted externally within a trusted mediator or a blockchain, which is part of future works. One of the main requirements of this framework is for each participating organisation to hold its local network data traffic in a common logging format. The benefits of having a standard feature set are many and explained here <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>. In this framework, a common feature set enables streamlined federated learning as the global model can extract meaningful patterns across a standard set of data features. The global model is designed to be compatible with the agreed network logging format.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Similar to standard federated learning approaches, the process is triggered by a global server initiating an ML model with a pre-defined architecture and parameters. The model is forwarded to each participant before it is trained and enhanced locally using the internal network data samples. Only the updated weights are sent back to the global server. The global server follows the <span id="S3.SS2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedAvg</span> technique <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> defined in Algorithm <a href="#algorithm1" title="In 3.2 Collaborative Federated Learning ‣ 3 Cyber Threat Intelligence Sharing ‣ A Cyber Threat Intelligence Sharing Scheme based on Federated Learning for Network Intrusion Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. In this step, the server aggregates the weights uploaded by each organisation to generate an enhanced intrusion detection model with an improved set of parameters designed over each participant’s network. This presents a single federated learning round and can be repeated several times to achieve a better detection performance across all the environments.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The key outcome is the design of a robust ML-based NIDS obtained from a collaboration between organisations without the need to share information with other participants to preserve data privacy. The final model is capable of detecting a wider range of attacks originating from several sources which are crucial in an organisational defence system. This provides a robust learning model with global intelligence and insights able to distinguish between heterogeneous benign and attack traffic. Such smart models would possibly lead to a lower false alarm rate in case of a variation of the benign traffic distribution caused by a modification of the SOE due to the learning from several networks’ network usage. Moreover, a higher detection rate of advanced and zero-day attacks is promising due to the extraction of malicious patterns from a wider range of attacks that targeted several organisational networks.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To evaluate the feasibility and performance of our proposed collaborative CTI Sharing scheme based on federated learning for NIDS, we utilise two key and widely used NIDS datasets. Each dataset has been collected over a different network, each consisting of a different set of benign applications and malicious attack scenarios. Therefore, each dataset represents a certain organisational network with a unique SOE and malicious events encountered. The datasets also hold a very distinctive statistical distribution as presented here <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. This matches the assumption of obtaining non-IID datasets collected over different real-world networks. While the datasets are unique in their applications, protocols, and data classes, they share a common feature set based on NetFlow v9 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>, a defacto standard protocol in the networking industry. In this paper, the NF-UNSW-NB15-v2 and NF-BoT-IoT-v2 datasets are used to simulate two organisations collaborating in the design of a universal ML-based NIDS. By following a federated learning-based technique, each dataset is maintained internally in the learning and testing stages. The key benefit of the federated learning collaboration is the design of a robust ML-based NIDS trained on multiple organisational networks without any exchange of local network data samples. Hence, maintaining the privacy and integrity of sensitive user’s information. The datasets structure and format are explained below;</p>

The dataset is generated by converting the publicly available pcap files of the BoT-IoT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> dataset to 43 NetFlow v9 features using the nprobe <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> tool. The complete number of data flows are 37,763,497 labelled network data flows, where the majority are attack samples; 37,628,460 (99.64%) and, 135,037 (0.36%) are benign. The source dataset (BoT-IoT) is generated by an IoT-based network environment that consists of normal and botnet traffic. BoT-IoT was released in 2018 by the Cyber Range Lab of the ACCS. The non-IoT and IoT traffic were generated using the Ostinato and Node-red tools, respectively, and Tshark is used to capture the network packets.</p>

<div id="S4.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Three different approaches are considered in the evaluation process; federated, centralised, and localised learning scenarios. In the federated learning use case, an agreement is made between two or more participant organisations. The agreement specifies that each organisation participates by downloading an initialised ML model locally from a global server. The participant would train the learning model on its local data samples internally and upload the trained model parameters back to the global server. The global server receives each parameter from each organisation and averages the parameters together into a single model. This represents a single federated learning round and can be repeated until the model performance reaches a reliable state. For the centralised learning scenario, a similar collaboration agreement is conducted, however, each participating organisation sends their local training data to a central server for the training of the ML model on the complete set of aggregated data. In the localised learning scenario, there are no collaborations between organisations, therefore the model is trained on each organisation’s limited local data samples.</p>

The metrics are calculated in a binary format based on the True Positive (TP) and True Negative (TN) representing the numbers of the correctly classified attack and benign data samples, respectively. In addition to the False Positive (FP) and False Negative (FN) represent the numbers of the incorrectly classified benign and attack data samples, respectively. The experiments were conducted using Google’s Tensorflow Federated (TFF) framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> for the federated learning scenario and Tensorflow framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite> for the centralised and localised scenarios. The datasets are reprocessed by dropping the flow identifiers such as source/destination IP and ports to avoid bias towards the attacking and victim end nodes. A subset of each dataset with an equal number of benign and attack samples has been used to generate the below results. Each dataset has been split into training and testing splits in a ratio of 70% to 30%, respectively. A Min-Max scalier has been applied to normalise each dataset values into the same scale, defined as,</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">It is important to note that while a discovery stage was conducted by exploring a large number of hyper-parameter sets to obtain a reliable detection performance, the full exploration of the parameter’s space is not covered in this paper. The performance of the ML models and the overall proposed scheme can be improved by optimising the set of parameters adopted. Two key ML models adopted in the ML-based NIDS have been designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The same parameters were used across the three scenarios for a fair comparison. A Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LTSM) have been used in this paper with their parameters defined in Table <a href="#S4.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 4.1 Evaluation ‣ 4 Experimental Setup ‣ A Cyber Threat Intelligence Sharing Scheme based on Federated Learning for Network Intrusion Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. The hyper-parameters were identically designed to provide a fair comparison of their performance. There is a dropout of 40% of the input units between each hidden layer to help prevent over-fitting of the local client’s data.</p>

There is a significant drop in the FAR in both datasets after the first federated learning round in both datasets. The remaining metrics increase by around 30% and 15% in the NF-UNSW-NB15-v2 and NF-BoT-IoT-v2 datasets respectively. In Figure <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4.2 Results ‣ 4 Experimental Setup ‣ A Cyber Threat Intelligence Sharing Scheme based on Federated Learning for Network Intrusion Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, the LSTM model required a larger number of federated learning rounds to reach a reliable detection performance. During the first three rounds, the model was achieving a poor performance of 50% accuracy in both datasets. However, the performance rapidly increased between the fourth and seventh-round until it converged to its maximum reliable performance. The FAR dropped from 100% to nearly 8% during the 10 rounds of federated learning in both datasets.</p>

The lower performance noted in the federated learning approach was mainly due to a higher number of FAR of 4.72% and 7.17% using the DNN and LSTM models compared to 0.67% and 0.96% in the centralised scenario. While in the localised learning scenario, the lowest training time was achieved due to a lower number of training samples by a single organisation, the attack detection performance is unreliable. The model was unable to detect most of the attacks present in the NF-UNSW-NB15-v2 dataset after being trained on the NF-BoT-IoT-v2 dataset achieving an inadequate DR of 4.17% and 5.78% using the DNN and LSTM models, respectively.</p>

A similar pattern in the NF-UNSW-NB15-v2 dataset is observed where the federated and centralised learning scenarios achieve a reliable intrusion detection performance. The accuracy achieved by the federated and centralised learning methods is 93.04% and 9.83% using DNN and 93.03% and 93.90% using LSTM, respectively. The attack DR is slightly higher using both ML models in the federated learning method compared to the centralised learning method. Surprisingly, the localised learning use case achieved significantly better results on the NF-BoT-IoT-v2 test set when trained on the NF-UNSW-NB15-v2 dataset. This was not the same case for the other way around. This could indicate the presence of meaningful patterns in NF-UNSW-NB15-v2 to help the model identify attacks in NF-BoT-IoT-v2. The accuracy achieved is 86.21% using the DNN model and 88.52% using the LSTM model, the performance drop is mainly caused by a high FAR of 19.25% and 14.62%, respectively.</p>

Similarly, the results are grouped by the ML used and the scenario followed in the training process, and the federated learning results are achieved after the tenth training round. In addition, we measure the average of the attack DR to compare the three scenarios based on the number of attack behaviours detected. In Table <a href="#S4.T6" title="Table 6 ‣ 4.2 Results ‣ 4 Experimental Setup ‣ A Cyber Threat Intelligence Sharing Scheme based on Federated Learning for Network Intrusion Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, the highest DR is achieved by the centralised method in the NF-UNSW-NB15-v2 with an almost perfect DR of 99.41% using the DNN model and 96.48% using the LSTM model. The analysis, shellcode, and worm attacks were fully detected using both models. The federated learning approach came in second with an average DR of around 85% using both models. As seen in previous results, the localised scenario is unreliable in the detection of any attacks in the NF-UNSW-NB15-v2 dataset with an average DR of 6.70%.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p9.1" class="ltx_p">Overall, a large number of experiments were conducted to evaluate and compare the performance of three ML scenarios, i.e., federated learning, centralised and localised learning. For a fair evaluation, two different ML models were used in the training and testing stages. The results demonstrate that the best set of results were often achieved by following the centralised learning approach. However, this is not possible without breaching network users’ privacy by sharing sensitive data with third parties. In the real world, this might make centralised learning approaches unfeasible and costly for organisations. Therefore, the proposed scenario of a collaborative federated learning approach which achieved similar performance to the centralised approach makes it superior in terms of feasibility and preserving user privacy.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, a collaborative federated learning scheme is proposed to allow for CTI sharing between organisations to design a more effective ML-based NIDS. The collaboration between organisations attracts many benefits including the design of a robust learning model capable of detecting intrusions effectively across various organisational networks. The heterogeneity of the network data samples exposes the model to a wider variety of SOEs and attack scenarios. This reflects the real-world behaviour where each network accounts for a unique statistical distribution that ML model performance might not generalise across. The detection performance of the models is compared to centralised and localised learning scenarios. The results demonstrate that the federated learning performance is superior to the localised use case and similar to the centralised use case. However, the centralised method can not be used without breaching data privacy and security which renders it unfeasible in the real world. Future works involve enhancing the federated learning averaging algorithm to improve the detection performance of ML-based NIDS.</p>
