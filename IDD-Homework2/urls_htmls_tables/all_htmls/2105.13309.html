<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Smart devices, such as smartphones, wearables, robots, and others, can collect vast amounts of data from their environment. This data is suitable for training machine learning models, which can significantly improve their behavior, and therefore, the user experience. Federated learning is a young and popular framework that allows multiple distributed devices to train deep learning models collaboratively while preserving data privacy. Nevertheless, this approach may not be optimal for scenarios where data distribution is non-identical among the participants or changes over time, causing what is known as <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">concept drift</span>. Little research has yet been done in this field, but this kind of situation is quite frequent in real life and poses new challenges to both continual and federated learning. Therefore, in this work, we present a new method, called Concept-Drift-Aware Federated Averaging (CDA-FedAvg). Our proposal is an extension of the most popular federated algorithm, Federated Averaging (FedAvg), enhancing it for continual adaptation under concept drift. We empirically demonstrate the weaknesses of regular FedAvg and prove that CDA-FedAvg outperforms it in this type of scenario.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Over the last few decades, our society has experienced a technological explosion which, among other things, has gradually surrounded us with smart devices that are part of our daily lives. We are talking about smartphones, of course, but also wearables, “things” from the Internet of Things (IoT), service robots, etc. In short, multifunctional devices with cutting-edge technology that allows a great number of applications from all human domains: health, sport, education, banking, etc.
The growing amount of data that these devices can collect, together with a good intercommunication between them, enables the possibility of integrating machine learning models that evolve and adapt to improve their behaviour.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A good way to learn from the data collected on the devices would be by consensus, in which a global model is built from the partial data provided by each participant.
This learning process can be addressed either in a centralized manner, employing traditional and offline server-based architectures, or in a decentralized way, following approaches such as <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">federated learning</em> (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">konevcny2015federated </a>; <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">mcmahan2016federated </a>; <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">li2019federated </a></cite>. Centralized methods involve collecting and uploading data from all the participants, also known as <em id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">clients</em> or <em id="S1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">agents</em>, to a cloud-based server or data center, where it is processed. Decentralized methods, instead, aim to solve local sub-problems on the devices in a distributed and parallel way, and then usually combine the local solutions in the cloud.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Centralized solutions are undoubtedly still the most common option nowadays.
Nevertheless, applying cloud-centric approaches to learn from the data collected on the devices involves important issues:</p>
<ul id="S1.I1" class="ltx_itemize">
<li id="S1.I1.i1" class="ltx_item" style="list-style-type:none;">

<p id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Scalability</span>. This concerns both storage and communication costs, but also computing speeds. By having a central node acting as a server, there is always a risk that this will be a bottleneck. The more responsibilities the server has, the higher the risk.
Transferring large amounts of data over the network take a long time, and communication may be a continuous overhead. Similarly, central processing can take much more time than parallel computing in the clients.</p>
</div>

<li id="S1.I1.i2" class="ltx_item" style="list-style-type:none;">

<p id="S1.I1.i2.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.I1.i2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Data privacy and sensitivity</span>. Central data collection also puts user privacy at risk. The information collected on the devices may be sensitive. Therefore, over the last few years, several governments around the world have implemented new legislation to protect the data privacy, limiting data sending and storage only to what is consented by the consumer and absolutely necessary for processing. Examples of this are the European Commission’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">custers2019eu </a></cite> or the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights in the US <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">gaff2014privacy </a></cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i3.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.I1.i3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Adaptability</span>. In machine learning, it is common to assume that data is stationary and IID (independent and identically distributed). However, in most real-world situations, the underlying distribution of data changes between the different participants and also evolves over time. Heterogeneity among participants cannot be solved by learning a single centralized model. On the other hand, changes in data over time have been extensively studied in the literature and are commonly referred to as <em id="S1.I1.i3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">concept drift</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">lu2018 </a>; <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">lesort2020continual </a></cite>. If a concept drift happens, the patterns learned so far may not be relevant anymore, leading to poor model performance. Therefore, in this kind of situation, it is desirable to detect when these drifts occur in order to adapt to them. Although several solutions have been proposed for handling concept drift, none of them has been specifically designed for a multi-device setting. In this scenario, centralized management of concept drift could increase bandwidth, storage, and computational costs in the server, which brings us back to the first issue, scalability.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Due to these problems, decentralized solutions are best suited for learning from distributed devices. In this way, <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">federated learning</em> (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">konevcny2015federated </a>; <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">mcmahan2016federated </a>; <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">li2019federated </a></cite> has been positioned in recent years as the reference for distributed and collaborative machine learning, dealing with user privacy and scalability.
Nevertheless, literature on FL has paid little attention to adaptability, particularly in the temporal dimension.
In this regard, <em id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">continual learning</em> (CL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">lesort2020continual </a>; <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">parisi2019 </a></cite>, is the state-of-the-art paradigm for addressing this problem of data nonstationarity and adaptability over time. In order to achieve adaptive models, CL deals with two conflicting objectives: retaining previously learned knowledge that is still relevant, and replacing any obsolete knowledge with current information. This is usually known as the <em id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">stability-plasticity dilemma</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">grossberg1988 </a></cite>.</p>

In particular, we extend the algorithm to deal with <em id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">continual single-task problems</em>. That is, we focus on the scenario where all the client devices share the same goal, but the underlying joint distribution of data might be non-IID (independent and identically distributed) among them, and can also change in unforeseen ways over time (concept drift). We call our new method <em id="S1.p5.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Concept-Drift-Aware Federated Averaging</em> (CDA-FedAvg). In this article we also describe the performance of our method when it has been tested for the task of human activity recognition (HAR) using smartphones. In this case, we have used a dataset created from the data collected by the mobile devices of 10 different users.
Our experimental results show the weaknesses of regular FedAvg in this kind of continual setting and a remarkable improvement in the learning ability of CDA-FedAvg over FedAvg. We also prove a reduction in storage, communication, and computational costs in the devices.

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Continual learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">lesort2020continual </a>; <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">parisi2019 </a></cite> is a machine learning paradigm focused on building adaptive models over time. This approach seeks to smoothly update the predictor to take into account different data distributions and tasks but still being able to re-use and retain useful knowledge during the time. It is highly inspired by the human learning process, as people learn to perform numerous tasks over their lifespan, making use of past knowledge to learn about new concepts without forgetting the previous ones. CL deals with high and realistic time scales where data becomes available only during the time, and past information is not always accessible.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Concept drift is one of the two main challenges —together with <em id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">catastrophic forgetting</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">french1999catastrophic </a></cite>— currently being addressed by CL literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">lesort2020continual </a></cite>. When the distribution is not stationary, a shift into the data stream is observed. If no external information regarding this shift is available, we must employ some other strategy to detect it, and also fix it. An undetected shift in the data distribution will lead to a downgrade in the model performance. These unpredictable changes in the data distribution over time are what is commonly known as <em id="S2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">concept drift</em>.
Handling concept drift also involves managing memories of past concepts, which can be saved in different manners: as raw data, as representations, as model weights, etc. An efficient memory management strategy should only save important information, as well as be able to transfer knowledge and skills to future tasks.</p>

<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">konevcny2015federated </a>; <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">mcmahan2016federated </a>; <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">li2019federated </a></cite> is a distributed machine learning framework under differential privacy. Basically, it consists of a local learning stage in the devices, and a global parameter aggregation in a central server in the cloud. Usually, there is a shared model, which is a Deep Neural Network (DNN). The learnable parameters of this model are initialized on the server. In each federated round, the clients receive the current parameter set from the server, perform stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on their local datasets, and send back the gradients. Guarantees about the lack of sensitive information of the gradient have been widely studied to preserve client privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">kairouz2019advances </a></cite>. After that, the contributions of each device are aggregated on the server, thus updating the model. The most popular FL algorithm is <em id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Federated Averaging</em> (FedAvg) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">mcmahan2016federated </a></cite>. The different challenges this framework faces, such as the communication costs and data statistical heterogeneity, have also been given significant attention in the literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">li2020federated </a></cite>. FL has been widely applied to solve complex classification and regression tasks, such as object recognition and movement detection in images, predictive text on the smartphone keyboard, or patient mortality prediction and hospital stay time <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">li2019federated </a>; <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">aledhari2020federated </a></cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">As we exposed in Section <a href="#S1" title="1 Introduction ‣ Concept drift detection and adaptation for federated and continual learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, three main challenges must be addressed for <em id="S2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">multi-device learning</em>: (1) scalability, (2) data privacy, and (3) adaptability.
Federated learning seems, at present, the most suitable approach for this context, since it successfully tackles the first 2 challenges. However, continual learning is undoubtedly the paradigm by reference as far as adaptability is concerned.
Addressing both FL and CL in an orthogonal way can be the best way to tackle at the same time all the three challenges. Nevertheless, little work has yet been done in this regard.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Some authors have evaluated Federated Averaging on non-IID scenarios, analyzing the impact of non-identical client data partitions. It is the case of McMahan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">mcmahan2016federated </a></cite>, that synthesize pathological non-identical user splits from the MNIST dataset, or Zhao et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">zhao2018federated </a></cite>, that does the equivalent using the CIFAR-10 dataset. They demonstrate that FedAvg on non-identical clients still converges to high accuracies, though taking more rounds than identical clients. Other authors study more realistic client data distributions. For instance, Caldas et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">caldas2018leaf </a></cite> use the Extended MNIST dataset with partitions over writers of the digits, rather than simply partitioning over digit class.
Finally, there are some authors that, instead of assuming that the global model should be identical for all clients, have proposed a local personalization for each participant. In this way, Li et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">li2018federated </a></cite> allow certain variation between the model of each client and the model obtained with FedAvg. On the other hand, Deng et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">deng2020adaptive </a></cite> keep track of each clients’ local model and take in into account for adaptation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">All the aforementioned works focus on analyzing the impact of non-identical client data partitions in FedAvg performance. However, little effort has been made to evaluate the effect of nonstationary, time-shifting data streams. Yoon et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">yoon2020federated </a></cite> propose a method called <em id="S2.p6.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Federated Continual Learning with Weighted Inter-client Transfer</em>, FedWeIt, which additively decomposes the weights of the network into two separated sets: globally shared parameters and sparse task-specific parameters. Hence, they are capable of performing inter-client knowledge transfer and prevent inter-client interference. They validate their approach on several settings, including continual multi-incremental-task scenarios. When comparing their method with existing federated baselines, they show significantly higher accuracy and reduced communication costs.

Nevertheless, as we will show in Section <a href="#S5" title="5 Experimental Results ‣ Concept drift detection and adaptation for federated and continual learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, naive training of FedAvg in real-world situations can lead to catastrophic forgetting, because local data is by nature nonstationary and non-IID. When data distribution is not stationary, a concept drift is observed in the data stream. In the absence of external information about this drift, the model will have to detect and adapt to it on its own to avoid decreasing its performance.</p>

The reason for this decision is that we want our drift detection method (Section <a href="#S4.SS1" title="4.1 Drift Detection ‣ 4 Concept-Drift-Aware Federated Averaging (CDA-FedAvg) ‣ Concept drift detection and adaptation for federated and continual learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.1</span></a>) to be completely unsupervised, i.e., to work without needing the pattern labels.</p>

<div id="S3.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, it is also interesting to classify concept drift considering how the new joint distribution is different from the previous one. In this case we can discern four types of concept drift: (i) sudden, (ii) recurring, (iii) gradual, and (iv) incremental. We say a concept drift is <span id="S3.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">sudden</span> if there is a timestamp that separates the old concept from the new one. In particular, this process can happen repeatedly and even go back to the original concept, and in that case we say it is a <span id="S3.p6.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">recurring</span> concept drift. On the contrary, if the data from the new concept arises intertwined with the old concept at first, we name it <span id="S3.p6.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">gradual</span> concept drift. <span id="S3.p6.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Incremental</span> concept drift takes place when data shifts smoothly between the concepts, and therefore the drift cannot be detected in a single instant but within a window of consecutive timestamps. As we will see afterwards, the method we propose deals both with <span id="S3.p6.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">gradual</span> and <span id="S3.p6.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">sudden</span> drifts, and hence with <span id="S3.p6.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">recurring</span> ones too. The case of <span id="S3.p6.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">incremental</span> drift is more subtle, as our method could detect it in certain situations depending on some hyperparameters of the algorithm (see Section <a href="#S4.SS1" title="4.1 Drift Detection ‣ 4 Concept-Drift-Aware Federated Averaging (CDA-FedAvg) ‣ Concept drift detection and adaptation for federated and continual learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.1</span></a>).</p>

<p id="S3.p7.13" class="ltx_p">We now extend the conventional concept drift definition to the federated learning setting, with multiple clients and a global server.

Each client will have a different bias because of the conditions of its local environment. Likewise, its data stream may change in different ways over time.

<p id="S3.p10.1" class="ltx_p">We already discussed the possible existence of a change in the joint distribution of a client or a small subset of clients that do not affect the global joint distribution. This could happen mainly for two different reasons: That client’s data is the only one that is changing, or the rest of the clients have not detected that change yet. If that is the case, while that client is getting data that differs from that of other clients, the global model may perform poorly on it. Therefore, it could be necessary to consider some adaptive strategy to improve the results on that client <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">deng2020adaptive </a></cite>. However, in our case scenario, we assume that the drift is the same and simultaneously occurs for all the clients. Under these assumptions, local and global concept drifts are indistinguishable.</p>

Hence, the global model could be better fitted to the particularities of the most active participants. In order to prevent overfitting of the model to some clients, it could be interesting to consider bounds on the participation rates to control the number of updates per client.</p>

<p id="S4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Clients are responsible for learning the task locally, managing, if necessary, the concept drift.
Research on learning under concept drift is usually divided into three main stages <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">lu2018 </a></cite>: (1) drift detection (whether or not a drift occurs), (2) drift understanding (exactly when, how, where and why it occurs) and (3) drift adaptation (response to that drift). Our method focuses on global drift detection and adaptation. To that end, each client (Algorithm <a href="#algorithm4" title="In 4 Concept-Drift-Aware Federated Averaging (CDA-FedAvg) ‣ Concept drift detection and adaptation for federated and continual learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>) will continually acquire new data from its environment. This data will be processed to identify new concepts (drift detection) and learn from them (drift adaptation). The issue of drift understanding is beyond the scope of this article. We are just concerned about detecting a difference between two timestamps, without analyzing the drift nature, or what causes it.</p>

Thus, the first data acquired by each client will automatically belong to the initial concept. This data will be stored in the long-term memory and used to perform the first local update (line 3). After that, each client continues to acquire new data, saving it in the short-term memory and processing it to check whether a drift is detected (lines 5–13). Only when the drift detection algorithm confirms the drift (line 14), new data related to the new concept will be stored in the long-term memory and further training rounds will be carried out (line 16). In the following two subsections, we will discuss in more detail the two fundamental parts of our method on the client side: drift detection (Section <a href="#S4.SS1" title="4.1 Drift Detection ‣ 4 Concept-Drift-Aware Federated Averaging (CDA-FedAvg) ‣ Concept drift detection and adaptation for federated and continual learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.1</span></a>) and drift adaptation (Section <a href="#S4.SS2" title="4.2 Drift Adaptation ‣ 4 Concept-Drift-Aware Federated Averaging (CDA-FedAvg) ‣ Concept drift detection and adaptation for federated and continual learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.2</span></a>).</p>

<div id="S4.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Drift detection encompasses the range of procedures and techniques that recognize and quantify concept drift via identifying change points or change intervals in the underlying distribution of data. In our context, detecting concept drift implies that the federated model is no longer a good predictor for all the clients and must be adapted.
Drift detection algorithms generally fall into three categories <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">lu2018 </a></cite>: (1) error rate-based methods, (2) data distribution-based methods and (3) multiple hypothesis test methods. The algorithms of the first group focus on tracking changes in the online error rate of the model. The second class uses a distance function or metric to quantify the dissimilarity between the distribution of historical data and that of new data. The third category combines techniques from the two previous ones in several ways.
In this work we decided to use a data distribution-based algorithm. Our choice is based on being able to detect virtual concept drift without needing pattern labels as input.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Once a concept drift is detected, the model should continue to be trained being aware of that drift. Otherwise, catastrophic forgetting may occur. When dealing with neural networks, as is the case here, the most common methods to avoid this are (1) regularization methods, (2) rehearsal approaches, and (3) generative replay <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">lesort2020continual </a></cite>. In continual learning, regularization consists of protecting the important weights of previous concepts from modification. Rehearsal or replay approaches are based on saving raw samples as a memory of past tasks. Generative replay techniques train generative models on the data distribution, thus being able to sample data from past experiences when learning on the new one.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Rehearsal methods have been shown to provide the best results, as they ensure that the memories do not degrade over time <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">van2019three </a></cite>. When working in a cloud-centric setting, the main drawback of these techniques is the need for a separate memory of raw data. This is a vanilla way of saving knowledge that does not respect data privacy and may involve high storage requirements. Nonetheless, in the federated (and therefore distributed) setting, this is not a problem since small pieces of old memories can be stored locally by each of the clients. Thus, we propose to use a simple rehearsal method, which is detailed in Algorithm <a href="#algorithm6" title="In 4.2 Drift Adaptation ‣ 4 Concept-Drift-Aware Federated Averaging (CDA-FedAvg) ‣ Concept drift detection and adaptation for federated and continual learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As we already mentioned, in a naive implementation of FedAvg there is no given criterion on what data to store and what to discard. By default, unless there are task-dependent or implementation restrictions, devices will save all the data they collect. Besides, FedAvg does not set any limits on the number of training rounds to be performed, which could be infinite. It is true that only a random subset of devices is selected in each round, so they are not training all the time. In addition, it is possible to limit training even further based on conditions such as whether the device has access to WiFi or is connected to a power supply (this is specially intended for smartphones) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">konevcny2016federated </a>; <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">hard2018federated </a></cite>. However, these criteria do not take into account whether there is a real need for further training. Finally, training constantly and without proper criteria also implies an increase in the required bandwidth. In fact, in many works in the literature of federated learning authors state that the main bottleneck is the communication cost <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">mcmahan2016federated </a>; <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">yoon2020federated </a></cite>.</p>

<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The dataset gathers data from 10 different people. Everyone performed each of the 7 activities for about 20 minutes (4 minutes for each phone position). The ten participants were male, aged between 25 and 30 years. All experiments were conducted indoors in the same building, except for the biking ones, which took place outside.
The smartphones were oriented vertically for the upper arm, wrist, and two pockets, and horizontally for the belt position. The data that was collected includes the readings from the inertial sensors of the smartphone, comprising the tri-axis accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer. The data acquisition rate was limited to 50 samples per second because it is enough to recognize human physical activities.</p>

In order to create a federated learning setting, we choose 9 of the 10 phone users as clients, in which both FedAvg and CDA-FedAvg will be running. Data from the remaining participant is used for testing. In the experiments that we will show below, we performed cross-validation. Thus, in the 9–1 split between training and testing, the test user was permuted a total of 10 times, so that each experiment was repeated 10 times. Since there are relatively few devices, at each federated round of each execution, all 9 clients participated in the local training, instead of selecting a random subset.</p>

However, there is nothing preventing CDA-FedAvg algorithm from being applied using a different type of network, like any other feed-forward architecture; recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as long short-term memory (LSTM); or even a hybrid approach. The architecture we propose has 6 input channels and consists of two 1D convolutional layers, one max-pooling layer, one flattening layer, two dropout layers and two fully connected layers. The total number of learnable parameters is 764399.

A dropout rate of 0.2 was used in both dropout layers. We used a batch size of 100 instances. On each local training round, 10 epochs were performed by each client. For simplicity in presenting the results, we assume all clients begin to acquire data at the same time and at the same frequency.</p>

<p id="S5.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To provide a baseline, we first carried out federated learning under the unrealistic assumption that data is acquired in an identically distributed manner over time and for all users. Thus, we simply shuffled all the data of each user (5000 samples) randomly, without taking into account the position of the phone, thus forcing a stationary situation (IID in the temporal domain). We applied regular FedAvg algorithm during a total of 25 rounds of local training and server aggregation. We repeated the experiment 10 times, each time leaving a different client for testing. On average, at the end of the process, we achieve over 85% accuracy on test.

<p id="S5.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Although the results in Figure <a href="#S5.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 5 Experimental Results ‣ Concept drift detection and adaptation for federated and continual learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> are quite good, in real life the data is often non-IID and evolves over time. Hence, in our second experiment, we sorted the data of all the users by phone position. In this way, we force a nonstationary distribution that changes a total of 4 times. Each change in the placement of the device implies a change in the underlying distribution of the data, i.e., a concept drift. Data is sorted according to the phone position in the same way for all users: 1<sup id="S5.p7.1.1" class="ltx_sup">st</sup> belt, 2<sup id="S5.p7.1.2" class="ltx_sup">nd</sup> left pocket, 3<sup id="S5.p7.1.3" class="ltx_sup">rd</sup> right pocket, 4<sup id="S5.p7.1.4" class="ltx_sup">th</sup> upper arm, and 5<sup id="S5.p7.1.5" class="ltx_sup">th</sup> wrist. For each location, the corresponding 1000 data observations are randomly sorted. This is not a totally realistic scenario since in real life each user would acquire data in a particular manner, but it is helpful to constrain the changes and check their impact during training. Again, we applied regular FedAvg algorithm with exactly the same configuration as before, training a total of 25 rounds. Figure <a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 5 Experimental Results ‣ Concept drift detection and adaptation for federated and continual learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> shows the average results of the 10 executions. The vertical dashed lines indicate where a distribution change occurs, which is every 1000 patterns for all the users. It can be seen that, although the general tendency of the model is to improve, it forgets concepts as it learns others. For example, from iteration 1000 it begins to learn about the left pocket position, which causes a drop in accuracy for data related to the previous concept, the belt. The final average accuracy of the model is around 63%.

<p id="S5.p9.1" class="ltx_p">In this case, training does not start at the very beginning. Instead, the first round is not performed until every client has a representative amount of data from the first concept (here, belt position) in its long-term memory. We fix the number of training rounds per concept to 5. Thus, as there are 5 different changes, the model is trained for a total of 25 rounds. This has been intentionally designed to be on a par with the previous setting. Drifts occur at the same time points as in the previous case (iterations 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000). Nevertheless, now the vertical dashed lines indicate where a drift is actually detected by at least one of the clients applying our detection method. We can notice that all drifts are detected shortly after they theoretically occur.

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have tackled the problem of federated and continual learning under concept drift. We have started by discussing the issues that need to be addressed to achieve real multi-device learning. We have also reviewed the state of the art of continual and federated frameworks. We have shown the shortcomings of regular federated algorithms, such as FedAvg, when data is nonstationary over time, which is a common real-world situation. Therefore, we have developed a new method, Concept-Drift-Aware Federated Averaging (CDA-FedAvg).
</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our proposal is an extension of the original FedAvg, but capable of detecting concept drifts and adapting to them. For drift detection, we introduce a distribution-based algorithm, which uses a confidence metric to quantify the dissimilarity between the distribution of historical and new data. We define a short-term and a long-term memory for each client. When a drift happens, we adapt the federated model applying rehearsal using the data in the long-term memory. In this way, we avoid catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, we answer two fundamental questions: <em id="S6.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">what</em> to learn and <em id="S6.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">when</em> to learn it. This allows us to save storage, communication and computational resources. We have evaluated CDA-FedAvg in a real multiclass classification problem, human activity recognition, and we have shown that our method outperforms regular FedAvg in this kind of scenario.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Regarding our future work, we would like to continue to pursue this line of research. We want to further extend our framework for federated and continual learning, focusing on adaptability. Therefore, we will work in parallel in two dimensions: the temporal and the spatial. The temporal dimension is the one we have explored the most so far. However, we can still make progress on issues such as tackling not only the virtual but also the real concept drift. When we talk about the spatial dimension, we refer to the heterogeneity among clients and the adaptation to the local particularities of each one. There are already some proposals in this context, but they are still limited by certain assumptions that make them unsuitable for real-world applications. For instance, it is not considered that different clients may have different behaviors and therefore could label the same pattern in a distinct way. Nevertheless, we believe that the real challenge lies in addressing these two axes, temporal and spatial, at the same time. This is something that has not yet been done and opens up a much richer and more complex range of possibilities. Finally, we also want to gradually expand our experimental analysis, applying our algorithms to other applications in different fields, not only for smartphones. We are particularly interested in service robotics.</p>
