<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">Along with the popularity of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet-of-Things (IoT), Federated Learning (FL) has attracted steadily increasing
attentions as a promising distributed machine learning paradigm, which enables
the training of a central model on for numerous
decentralized devices without exposing their
privacy. However, due to the biased data distributions on involved
devices, FL inherently suffers from low classification
accuracy in non-IID scenarios.
Although various device grouping method have been
proposed to address this problem, most of them neglect both
i) distinct data distribution characteristics of heterogeneous devices, and
ii) contributions and hazards of local models, which are extremely
important in determining the quality of global model aggregation.
In this paper, we present an effective FL method named FedEntropy
with a novel dynamic
device grouping scheme,
which makes full use of the above two factors based on
our proposed maximum entropy judgement heuristic.
Unlike existing FL methods that directly
aggregate local models returned from all the selected devices, in one FL round
FedEntropy firstly
makes a judgement based on the pre-collected
soft labels of selected
devices and then only aggregates the local models that can
maximize the overall entropy of these soft labels.
Without collecting local models that are harmful for
aggregation, FedEntropy can effectively improve
global model accuracy while reducing the overall communication overhead.
Comprehensive experimental results on well-known benchmarks show that,
FedEntropy not only outperforms
state-of-the-art FL methods in terms of model accuracy and communication overhead, but also can be integrated into them to enhance their classification
performance.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the prosperity of Artificial Intelligence
(AI) and Internet of Things (IoT), Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">mcmahan2017communication </a>; <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">GhoshCYR20 </a>; <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">MitraJPH21 </a></cite>
has been increasingly used in various
security-critical AI IoT (AIoT) applications (e.g., autonomous driving,
commercial surveillance, and healthcare informatics). Unlike traditional
centralized machine learning methods,
FL provides a decentralized framework that can train a
global Deep Neural Network (DNN)
model without compromising
user privacy (i.e., data) distributed on devices.
Typically, FL adopts a cloud-device architecture, where the cloud manages a
global model for the knowledge fusion of local models on
devices. During the FL training, devices only need to send their local models to
the cloud for aggregation. Without sending local device data directly to
the cloud, the data privacy of devices can be guaranteed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">NEURIPS2021_285baacb </a></cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Although FL is good at sharing
knowledge among
all the involved
devices, due to
biased device data distributions in non-IID (Not Independent and Identically Distributed) scenarios,
it greatly suffers from
low classification
accuracy caused by
statistical heterogeneity of datasets and high communication overhead due to
periodic model aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">NEURIPS2021_2f2b2656 </a>; <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">DBLP:conf/nips/KarimireddyJKMR21 </a>; <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">DBLP:conf/aistats/0001MR20 </a></cite>.
To mitigate these problems,
various variants have been proposed
to improve FL performance from different perspectives, such
as constrained local updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">li2020federated </a>; <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">karimireddy2019scaffold </a>; <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">li2021model </a></cite>, device grouping <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">DBLP:conf/bigdataconf/ChenCZK20 </a>; <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">DBLP:conf/icml/FraboniVKL21 </a></cite>, and knowledge distillation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">zhu2021data </a>; <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1910-03581 </a>; <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">DBLP:conf/nips/LinKSJ20 </a></cite>.
Although they can effectively
increase the classification accuracy or reduce the communication overhead of
vanilla FL in non-IID scenarios, most of them treat all the devices equally without taking their specific characteristics and effects into account during the
aggregation.
Simply aggregating local models to the cloud in an
equal manner will inevitably result in
a notable loss of classification accuracy and a slowdown of convergence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2105-07066 </a>; <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">DBLP:conf/mm/Zhuang0ZGYZZY20 </a></cite>.
In this case, some useless local models are forced to
participate the aggregation in one FL training round, which may affect the
aggregation quality as well as result in more communication overhead. Worse still,
a participant device may upload a harmful local model
with extremely
biased data distribution
to the cloud, which may significantly
degrade the aggregation quality resulting in
low classification accuracy.
Therefore, <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">how to accurately model the
distribution characteristics of device data
and utilize them to facilitate
the global model aggregation to achieve better
overall performance is becoming a
challenge in FL design</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Since entropy can accurately quantify the
information carried by a specific probability distribution, it
has been widely used for various classification purposes
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">DBLP:conf/nips/DubeyGRN18 </a></cite>.
Based on the merits of entropy, in this paper we
propose an effective FL method named FedEntropy with
a novel
dynamic device grouping scheme, which enables the
evaluation and selection of device models before
they are uploaded to the cloud.
Unlike traditional FL, in one training round of
FedEntropy, the cloud firstly collects
the soft labels from selected
devices and judges their
contributions to the overall entropy
of soft labels. Then, only a subset of
selected devices that maximize the overall
entropy need to upload their local models to the cloud
for aggregation.
In this way, FedEntropy effectively and safely
filters both useless and harmful devices for
aggregation, thus leading to higher classification
performance with less communication overhead.

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To improve the classification accuracy in non-IID scenarios,
existing FL methods can be classified into three major
categories based on local training correction,
device grouping, and knowledge distillation, respectively.
The
<span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">local training correction-based methods</span>
require modifying loss functions during local model training.
For example, by adding a proximal term to regularize the local loss function, Li et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">li2020federated </a></cite> introduced FedProx that
can make trained local models get closer to the global model. Based on model-contrastive learning, Li et al. proposed
Moon <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">li2021model </a></cite>, which can
correct the deviation of local models
from their global model.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">karimireddy2019scaffold </a></cite>,
Karimireddy et al. presented a stochastic controlled averaging scheme
called SCAFFOLD, which can address the “client drift” issue caused by data heterogeneity.
However, the introduction of
global control variables in SCAFFOLD incurs
high communication overhead, which is twice than that of FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">mcmahan2017communication </a></cite>.
The <span id="S2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">device grouping-based approaches</span> take the data similarity among all devices into account.
For example, Duan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">DBLP:journals/tpds/DuanLCLTL21 </a></cite>
proposed Astraea, which groups local models
based on the KL divergence of their data distributions and builds mediators to reschedule the training of local models.
Fraboni et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">DBLP:conf/icml/FraboniVKL21 </a></cite> developed
a method for clustering local models
based on sample size or model similarity, which can improve the representativity of local models and decrease the variance of random aggregation in FL.
The <span id="S2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">knowledge distillation-based approaches</span> use soft labels generated by a “teacher model” to guide the training of “student models”.
For example, Zhu et al.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">zhu2021data </a></cite> presented
a data-free knowledge distillation method called FedGen that uses a lightweight generator to correct local training.
Under the help of some
unlabeled dataset, Lin et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">DBLP:conf/nips/LinKSJ20 </a></cite>
proposed FedDF, which accelerates the training convergence by
adopting outputs of local models to train
the global model.
Although the above FL
methods are promising, they do not take the data distribution characteristics of devices into account, which can be used
to further improve the
classification performance in non-IID scenarios.

<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As an essential principle of Bayesian
statistics, Maximum Entropy Principle (MEP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">jaynes1957information </a></cite>
has been widely applied in many areas of machine learning, including supervised learning
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">DBLP:journals/jmlr/ChenGGRC09 </a>; <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">DBLP:conf/nips/ZhuXZ08 </a></cite>
and reinforcement learning.
For testable information, MEP assumes
that the probability distribution
best representing the current state of knowledge
is the one with the largest entropy, where
the distribution should be as uniform as possible.
In supervised learning, most of
existing MEP-based methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">DBLP:journals/jmlr/Shawe-TaylorH09 </a>; <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">DBLP:conf/iclr/PereyraTCKH17 </a></cite>
focus on the entropy-based optimization
of classifiers to
improve classification accuracy.
Our approach is inspired by the work in
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">DBLP:conf/nips/DubeyGRN18 </a></cite>,
which applies MEP on soft labels generated by classifiers. However, none of them
take MEP into account to optimize the
classification performance in FL.
To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt that applies
soft label-based
MEP on device grouping.
Since our approach makes full use of device data distribution characteristics in non-IID scenarios, it can not only enhance the overall FL classification performance, but also reduce the communication overhead between the cloud and devices.</p>

data distribution characteristics. Based on our observation, it is not suitable to randomly group local models on devices for the purpose of model aggregation, since
contradictive local models within a same group may interfere with each other, resulting in low classification accuracy. To avoid this case, in FedEntropy we adopt a two-stage
device selection strategy to
enable fine-granularity
device grouping. In the first stage, FedEntropy collects the soft labels from
a coarse set of selected devices rather than their local models, indicating the
data distributions on devices.
By using our
proposed maximum entropy judgement heuristic, FedEntropy can
quickly figure out which
local models are not friendly for the aggregation based on the collected
soft labels and filter their corresponding devices
away from the group. Based on the fine-tuned
new device group, the second stage acts in the same way as the traditional FL methods.</p>

In step 1 the cloud broadcasts the global model to
all the selected devices. Once the selected devices finish
the local training, in step 2 they only forward their soft labels
to the server. Note that,
compared with the size of a local model,
the size of a soft label is negligible.
All the collected soft labels will then be
processed by the maximum
entropy judgment module of the cloud,
where labels that lead to maximum aggregated information entropy
will be used for fine-grained device grouping. For all the selected
devices in this training round, we
mark the devices whose soft labels
contribute to the maximum entropy
as <span id="S3.SS2.p2.3.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">positive devices</span>, while the other remaining
devices are marked as
<span id="S3.SS2.p2.3.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">negative devices</span>.
In step 3, only the positive devices need to upload their
local models for the aggregation, which will be executed in step 4.
At the end of each round, the positive devices and negative devices
will be put into the <span id="S3.SS2.p2.3.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">positive device pool</span> and <span id="S3.SS2.p2.3.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">negative

To accurately calculate such information entropy,

<p id="S3.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">According to the intrinsic property of information entropy,
only when the data distribution of selected
devices is uniform, we can achieve the highest information entropy.
Based on the observation in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">DBLP:journals/tpds/DuanLCLTL21 </a></cite>, when the overall
data distributions on the selected devices is uniform (i.e.,
the datasets are complementary to each other), we can achieve the best
aggregation quality. In other words, the higher the overall entropy of soft labels sent by
selected devices is , the better the aggregation quality
we can achieve.
However, it is hard to achieve such a uniform distribution in FL, especially for
non-IID scenarios. In order to make
an entropy of some device group as high as possible,
we design a maximum entropy judgement, which can effectively filter the devices that has
negative impacts on the maximum entropy calculation.</p>

positive devices and negative devices, respectively. Although the devices
in the positive device pool can contribute more to the overall entropy, it does not
mean the datasets of negative devices are useless. In fact,
the main reason that a device is in the negative device
pool is because it fails to get on well with majority
of devices involved in FL.
In order to encourage all the devices to participate the global model
aggregation, we propose a dynamic device grouping strategy.

Since FedEntropy selectively aggregates a portion of devices per round,
we can reasonably regard FedEntropy as a variant of FedAvg

We compared FedEntropy with four FL methods including the classic one and three state-of-the-arts,
i.e., FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">mcmahan2017communication </a></cite>, FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">li2020federated </a></cite>, SCAFFOLD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">karimireddy2019scaffold </a></cite> and Moon <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">li2021model </a></cite>.

To facilitate the performance comparison, we evaluated the FL methods on
three well-known benchmark
datasets, i.e.,
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">krizhevsky2009learning </a></cite> and CINIC-10 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1810-03505 </a></cite>, where
the images of CINIC-10 come from ImageNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">DBLP:journals/corr/ChrabaszczLH17 </a></cite> and CIFAR-10.
Note that the CIFAR-100 dataset has two kinds of sample labels, i.e., fine-grained labels (with 100 classes) and coarse-grained labels (with 20 superclasses).
To better evaluate
the performance of different FL methods, we adopted the
coarse-grained labels for classification.
Similar to dataset distribution

that under different data heterogeneity settings, FedEntropy outperforms other FL methods
with a considerable improvement.
Taking the case 1 of CIFAR-10 as an example, the test accuracy of our FedEntropy is 5.44%, 4.93%, 10.22%, and 10.42% higher than FedAvg, FedProx, SCAFFOLD, and Moon, respectively.

Considering that the downlink communication overhead of all FL methods is consistent, here
we only consider the communication overhead of uploading local models.
For FedAvg, FedProx and Moon, the communication overhead per round is only for uploading the models of selected devices.
However,
for SCAFFOLD, in each round it additionally requires uploading the local control variables of selected devices, whose sizes are the same as
the ones of local models.
In other words, the communication cost of SCAFFOLD is twice that of traditional FL methods.
In the first stage of device selection,
FedEntropy firstly uploads the soft labels of selected
devices to the cloud. Since the data volume of soft labels is much
smaller than one of the local models, such communication overhead is negligible. For the second stage,
under maximum entropy judgment, the communication overhead
of FedEntropy per round is at most the same as the one of FedAvg.

the communication overhead required by the
five FL methods to achieve the same accuracy for different non-IID scenarios of CIFAR-10.
For the three different non-IID scenarios, we set the expected accuracy to 30%, 50%, and 50%, respectively. We can find that FedEntropy has the least number of communication rounds and the least communication overhead in all scenarios. Note that we can observe the similar trends for
the other two datasets.</p>

maximum entropy-based dynamic device grouping is improved significantly.
In other words, our dynamic device grouping can be integrated into
other FL methods to enhance their classification performance,
showing the orthogonality of FedEntropy for other FL methods.
By simply applying our dynamic device grouping method on
FedAvg, the results in Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 4.1 Experimental Settings ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ FedEntropy: Efficient Device Grouping for Federated Learning Using Maximum Entropy Judgment" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> and Table <a href="#S4.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 4.2 Performance Comparison ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ FedEntropy: Efficient Device Grouping for Federated Learning Using Maximum Entropy Judgment" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To accommodate the biased device data distributions in
non-IID scenarios, in this paper we proposed a novel FL
framework named FedEntropy, which takes both the
data distributions of devices and
contributions of local models to global model aggregation
into account.
Based on our maximum entropy judgement heuristic,
we designed
a two-stage device grouping method to enable fine-grained
selection of more suitable local models to achieve better
aggregation quality.
Comprehensive experimental results
on various well-known benchmarks show that, compared with state-of-the-art FL methods,
FedEntropy not only can achieve better FL performance in terms of both classification accuracy and communication overhead, but also can be
used to enhance their classification performance.</p>
