<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) allows predictive model training on the sensed data in a wireless Internet of things (IoT) network evading data collection cost in terms of energy, time, and privacy.
In this paper, for a FL setting, we model the learning gain achieved by an IoT device against its participation cost as its utility. The local model quality and the associated cost differs from device to device due to the device-heterogeneity which could be time-varying. We identify that this results in utility unfairness because the same global model is shared among the devices.
In the vanilla FL setting, the master is unaware of devices’ local model computation and transmission costs, thus it is unable to address the utility unfairness problem. In addition, a device may exploit this lack of knowledge at the master to intentionally reduce its expenditure and thereby boost its utility.
We propose to control the quality of the global model shared with the devices, in each round, based on their contribution and expenditure. This is achieved by employing differential privacy to curtail global model divulgence based on the learning contribution. Furthermore, we devise adaptive computation and transmission policies for each device to control its expenditure in order to mitigate utility unfairness.
Our results show that the proposed scheme reduces the standard deviation of the energy cost of devices by 99% in comparison to the benchmark scheme, while the standard deviation of the training loss of devices varies around 0.103.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The Internet of things (IoT) is largely based on the machine-type communication devices (MTDs) with sensing, computing, communication, and/or control capabilities, such as wearables, telemetry devices, surveillance devices, smartphones, etc., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Applying machine learning techniques on the sensing data acquired by these devices holds great potential of providing intelligent and personalized services to the user through predictive models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. However, this data is mostly private in nature, thereby collecting and storing this sensitive physical information in a centralized cloud server for learning is risky. In that, various scenarios exist where both parties may or may not be trustworthy. Moreover, due to the wireless and autonomous operation, these devices are mostly battery operated, thus the data communication is severely energy-constrained <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To mitigate the cost of collecting sensed data (in terms of energy, time, privacy) at a central entity, the training can be performed locally at the devices. Clearly the trained models will perform poorly due to the limited data size. Therefore, a specialized machine learning setting referred to as the Federated learning (FL) provides a distributed learning methodology to learn a global model at a central entity without the need to access distributive data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. In FL, a master device iteratively learns the global model parameters by combining the updates of local model parameters computed and then shared by the participating devices with the master.
In a wireless IoT network, FL realizes effective predictive model learning with profound communication efficiency and strong privacy. From the master’s perspective, FL enables global model learning in a privacy-preserving manner, i.e., without collecting sensitive data from the MTDs. On the other hand, each MTD procures a global model which is learned using disjoint data of multiple MTDs, thus a more effective model as compared to its local model. We refer to this improvement achieved in the model learning against the accumulative cost associated with local model computation and transmission towards the master as <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">MTD’s utility</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In the vanilla FL setting, each device receives the same global model from the master irrespective of the quality of its local model and the associated cost of computation and transmission. However, in a practical IoT network, the local model quality and accumulative cost vary between devices due to the (time-varying) diversity in the training data, wireless channel, computation/communication resources, etc. Furthermore, a malicious device may intentionally reduce the cost of computation and/or transmission, e.g., by decreasing the training dataset size, performing fewer iterations, re-transmitting the previous update, employing quantization/compression, etc. Thereby, the device increases its utility while enjoying the same global model as other legitimate devices.
This malicious behavior causes utility unfairness among devices and damages the quality of the global model which in turn increases the convergence time. In particular, if legitimate devices increase their computation budget to maximize the quality of the local model to help achieve better global model, their additional investment does not yield productivity gains due to the poor local models contributed by the malicious devices. Nevertheless, distinguishing this malicious behaviour from the natural channel/resource diversity is rather hard without additional information. In the existing FL settings, there are no standard of operations devised for this situation, thus the master cannot ensure pertinent operation of the devices.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Security and device heterogeneity are the two main issues for FL in a wireless IoT network setting. By evading data transmission, FL does protect devices from conventional eavesdropping attacks. Nevertheless, the private information can still be revealed by manipulating the transmitted local models. For example, a model inversion attack analyses the differences in the shared parameters (e.g., weights of a neural network) to reconstruct the training data of a device <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Similarly, a membership inference attack can reveal if a data sample was used in the training process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Thus, the training data is somewhat vulnerable in a FL setting. In this regard, differential privacy (DP) has been proved to offer quantifiable protection against information leakage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. DP is a proactive method of adding artificial noise to the data before sharing (we will discuss it in greater detail in the later sections). Various existing studies proposed DP based learning algorithms. Local DP (LDP) is employed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, in which users send a randomized version of their local data for distributed estimation over user uploaded data. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, DP based Stochastic gradient descent algorithm is analysed considering different dataset sizes and privacy levels.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To improve user services, a DP based personalized FL method is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> for a wireless IoT network. DP is just employed for protection and the focus is on the adaptive training which considers device heterogeneity and data ownership. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, DP based FL algorithm is proposed for Internet of Vehicles (IoV), which minimize the communication overhead while achieving high accuracy in a DP based secure manner. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, a DP based FL algorithm is employed to devise an incentive model based on computation, communication, and privacy cost of the devices. A higher cost yields a higher (unspecified) reward and the device’s utility is the difference between the reward and the cost. Similar incentive mechanisms for FL are proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. From the perspective of the master’s profit, some have evaluated device contribution based on the local training delay <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, others have evaluated device contribution based on the training dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Prior works on FL in a wireless IoT network only focused on the expenditure or contribution of the devices and proposed some (typically unspecified) reward/incentive in response to the device heterogeneity. A few have employed DP only for protection against attacks via eavesdropping. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has jointly considered the diversity in the expenditure and contribution of the devices impacting the master’s model learning, and addressed the unfairness among devices or the malicious behaviour mentioned above.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We consider a FL setting, in which multiple heterogeneous MTDs cooperate with a master. To address the utility unfairness problem among MTDs, we propose to control the quality of the global model shared with the MTDs, in each round, based on their contribution and expenditure.
We design a utility function for MTDs to model the learning gain and cost associated with it in each round. In particular, the utility function works as a catalyst and it is used to reveal the optimal computation and transmission policies such that the learning gain versus the cost is similar for all MTDs.
This is achieved by treating global model as a precious commodity and controlling its quality through DP. Accordingly, the master will add noise in the global model before sharing it with a MTD in proportion to the deviation of its local model from the global model. In the proposed methodology, the master relies only on the local model quality to decide the level of noise to be added in each round. It is because the computation and transmission costs cannot not be quantified effectively. We use DP in two-folds, first to provide security and second to curtail global model divulgence. Through an extensive performance analysis of the proposed scheme we seek answers to the following two questions:</p>

This implies that all MTDs must transmit their individual datasets to the AP, these datasets can be large and thus may incur huge data transmission cost on the MTDs. In many IoT cases, the complete dataset transmission is infeasible for MTDs due to the power constraint. In addition, the data sensed by these MTDs may contain sensitive information, e.g., user activity, medical history, etc. To this end, FL allows global model training in a privacy-preserving manner, i.e., without acquiring local training datasets at a central entity.</p>

After sufficient number of communication rounds, the objective function converges to a global optimal <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. Nevertheless, there are many challenges associated with FL’s convergence rate in a wireless network scenario with resource-constraint MTDs. For example, the energy-constraint puts a limit on the amount of data that can be sensed and trained. Secondly, the random nature of wireless medium makes the transmission of local model parameters challenging.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To protect the sensitive data of the MTDs from the likes of inference or membership attacks, the AP and MTDs preserve the privacy of their computed model parameters by employing DP framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. As such, a differentially private algorithm allows releasing some statistic or data with provable privacy protection guarantee against arbitrary adversaries. This is achieved by adding suitable level of randomness such that the absence of one individual/entity from a database will not substantially change the distribution of the output of the algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the proposed system, the objective of the AP is to learn a statistical model over the datasets of all participating MTDs without acquiring these datasets. Whereas, the objective of each MTD is to learn a better statistical model trained over multiple disjoint datasets of different MTDs as compared to its local model trained over much smaller dataset. Hence, the global model is more accurate than the individual local models. The improvement achieved in statistical model learning at the MTDs after each communication round is referred to as the learning gain.</p>

<p id="S3.p2.3" class="ltx_p">The learning gain is achieved by participation in FL mechanism, i.e., performing the local model training and transmission, which poses significant energy cost on resource constrained MTDs. The quality of the local model and the associated cost of computation and transmission will be different for different MTDs, because of the device heterogeneity in the sensing data, wireless channel, and availability of the computation and other resources.

<p id="S3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In a vanilla FL setting, each participating MTD receives the same global model update irrespective of the quality of its shared local model and the associated cost. Therein, a malicious MTD may intentional try to reduce the cost of computation and/or transmission of the local model, greedily increasing its utility by enjoying the same global model, i.e., level of accuracy, as other legitimate MTDs. This malicious behavior in a FL setting causes utility unfairness among MTDs and its poor quality local model adversely impacts the quality of the global model which in turn increases the convergence time and reduces the utility of the legitimate MTDs. That is, even if legitimate MTDs increase their computation budget to maximize the quality of the local model to help achieve a better global model, their additional investment doesn’t pay-off productivity gains due to the poor local models contributed by the malicious MTDs. Consequently, the legitimate MTDs don’t attain the expected improvement in their utility. The same problem can naturally be caused due to the device heterogeneity. Wherein, the local model quality and accumulative cost can be impacted by the (time-varying) diversity in the training data, wireless channel, computation/communication resources, etc. Nevertheless, distinguishing the malicious behaviour from the natural channel/resource diversity is rather hard without additional information.</p>

<p id="S3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Since, in the state-of-the-art FL settings, there are no specific standard of operations devised for participating MTDs, the AP cannot ensure their pertinent operation. To address these challenges in a FL based wireless IoT network with heterogeneous MTDs, we propose to preserve global model using DP. We design policies for the AP and the MTDs, where the AP strive to ensure utility fairness among MTDs and the MTDs try to maximize their utility. In particular, the utility function works as a catalyst and it is used to reveal the optimal computation and transmission policies, such that the learning gain versus the cost is similar for all devices.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As discussed earlier, the quality of the local model update can be significantly different for different MTDs due to various factors. In this regard, if the same global model is shared with all participating MTD, actually different MTDs spend different costs on local model computation and transmission, which would give rise to utility unfairness. In this setting, we propose to control the quality of the global model shared with different MTDs, in each communication round, based on their contribution towards the global model computation. In that the true global model will be treated as a precious commodity and will be shared in a differentially private manner among different MTDs. Accordingly, the AP will add noise in the global model before sharing it with a given MTD in proportion to the deviation of its local model from the global model. In the proposed methodology, the AP relies only on the local model quality to decide the level of noise to be added in each communication round. It is because in practical settings the computation and transmission cost of MTDs cannot not be quantified effectively at the AP.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The objective of each MTD is to allocate the optimal budget, for the local model computation and transmission, which will maximize its utility under given system constraints. The utility of a MTD decreases when the AP adds more noise to its global model update, which is directly proportional to the MTD’s deviation factor. Hence, the learning gain is proportional to the deviation factor, i.e., local model’s quality. The deviation factor increases by solving the local problem with lesser accuracy, or by using only a fraction of the local dataset for training, running less number of iterations. Overall, the deviation factor is directly proportional to the computation cost which is controlled by each MTD to maximize its utility.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p2.2" class="ltx_p">In this regard, each MTD performs the following operations after receiving its global model and the deviation factor from the AP. In expectation of receiving a less noisy global model in the next round, each MTD uses an energy cost to deviation factor model to map the decrease in the deviation factor when the budget for the computation cost is increased. We found this model using data fitting analysis for a FL system where MTDs controlled the computation cost using various ways mentioned above. In this model, the deviation factor expected by the <math id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="k" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">k</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1">𝑘</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1c">k</annotation></semantics></math>-th MTD in the <math id="S3.SS3.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="m" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.p2.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S3.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml">m</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.p2.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S3.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1">𝑚</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.p2.2.m2.1c">m</annotation></semantics></math>-th communication round for a given computation cost is given as</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This section presents simulation results to illustrate the performance of the proposed scheme. We first present the learning performance of the proposed scheme, and then study the impact of device heterogeneity on the energy expenditure and the trade-off between computation and transmission cost. To model the variable computation cost of local training at the MTDs, we keep the dataset size same at each MTD and the quality of the local model is controlled through the number of iterations, which is inline with prior works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.</p>

The batch size is set to 128 for all MTDs. The data is partitioned among MTDs in an i.i.d. fashion. Gradient method is used for optimizing with negative log likelihood loss and a learning rate of 0.01. The sensitivity of the data varies from one communication round to the next and its value fluctuates around 0.01. Unless specified otherwise, the parameters values shown in Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ IV Simulation Results ‣ Utility Fairness for the Differentially Private Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a> are adopted. The joint use of regularization and DP fend off overfitting, which improves the model accuracy for the data it has not seen before. Thus, the training loss is expected not to drop to zero.
Note that the FL performance with DP has been well studied in previous studies and thus it is not the focus of this paper. Our focus is rather to evaluate the relative performance of the heterogeneous wireless MTDs in a differentially-private FL algorithm.</p>

Although the objectives are different, the system models specifying the underlying FL and DP implementation are similar to our considered system. In this regard, our objective is to identify the utility unfairness issue among MTDs and these models suffice to demonstrate it. Once unfairness issue is divulged, we analyse the performance of the proposed scheme to counter that. When our considered system is applied, the design for the DP based FL models in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> can equivalently be represented by the following benchmark scheme.</p>

Although the channel heterogeneity (including the channel realization and the path loss) exists among MTDs, in any given round, the average loss and the standard deviation in loss across different MTDs is very similar for both schemes. Specifically, the average training loss is only 6.26% higher for the proposed scheme. This shows that the overall learning performance does not suffer from the proposed MTD-wise adaptive global model quality control. In addition, a small standard deviation, i.e., around 0.103, in training loss indicates that the learning experience is fair among MTDs.</p>

As expected, for the benchmark scheme the total energy cost significantly increases with the path loss severity due to the so-called near-far problem. It is because, in the vanilla FL setting the focus is kept on the local model quality and as many as possible iterations are performed for given delay bound. In contrast, for the proposed scheme the total energy cost remains almost flat for all MTDs irrespective of the channel statistics. Thereby, as desired, the MTDs spend similar energy to learn similar quality of the global model (utility fairness). Specifically, the proposed scheme reduces the standard deviation of the energy cost across MTDs by 99% and provides about 12.17% reduction in the average energy cost across MTDs as compared to the benchmark scheme. Importantly the proposed scheme achieves this utility fairness without any knowledge of the computation or transmission expenditure of MTDs at the AP or among MTDs.</p>

From Fig. <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ IV-B Performance Analysis ‣ IV Simulation Results ‣ Utility Fairness for the Differentially Private Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>(a), we can observe that the computation cost energy decreases with path loss severity for both schemes, however, the decrease is larger for the proposed scheme. Because the MTD with relatively poor channel experience is compelled to reduce the number of iterations to save time and energy, this in turn helps in reducing the transmission rate, thereby reducing the overall energy cost.</p>

This is due to the adaptive local model quality control as per the proposed strategy. On the other hand, the benchmark scheme pushes each MTD irrespective of their path loss, and thus the transmission energy cost for far-off MTDs rises staggeringly. This anomaly results in severe unfairness issue among MTDs with heterogeneous channel experiences.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have investigated the utility unfairness issue in a FL based wireless IoT network which is caused due to the device-heterogeneity. No prior work has jointly considered the diversity in devices’ expenditure and contribution impacting the global model learning, and addressed the utility unfairness among devices.
We propose to control the quality of the global model shared with the devices, in each round, based on their contribution and expenditure. We design a utility function which works as a catalyst and it is used to reveal the optimal computation and transmission policies, such that the learning gain versus the cost is similar for all devices, without any knowledge of the contribution and expenditure of other devices.
Our results show that the proposed scheme reduces the standard deviation of the energy cost across MTDs by 99% in comparison to the benchmark scheme, while the standard deviation of the training loss of MTDs varies around 0.103. The proposed scheme provides about 12.17% reduction in the average energy cost across MTDs as compared to the benchmark scheme.
Here, we assumed that the instantaneous channel gain for each device is perfectly estimated by the AP. In a more practical case of imperfect channel estimation, outage occurs at the AP, and hence, an additional outage probability constraint needs to be introduced into the optimization problem. Nevertheless, the overall principle of the proposed scheme remains the same.</p>
