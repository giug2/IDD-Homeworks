<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">To provide Uplink Centric Broadband Communication (UCBC), New Radio Unlicensed (NR-U) network has been standardized to exploit the unlicensed spectrum using Listen Before Talk (LBT) scheme to fairly coexist with the incumbent Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) network. Existing access schemes over unlicensed spectrum are required to perform Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) before transmissions, where fixed Energy Detection (ED) thresholds are adopted to identify the channel as idle or busy. However, fixed ED thresholds setting prevents devices from accessing the channel effectively and efficiently, which leads to the hidden
node (HN) and exposed node (EN) problems. In this paper, we first develop a centralized double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) algorithm to optimize the uplink system throughput, where the agent is deployed at the central server to dynamically adjust the ED thresholds for NR-U and WiFi networks. Considering that heterogeneous NR-U and WiFi networks, in practice, cannot share the raw data with the central server directly, we then develop a federated DDQN algorithm, where two agents are deployed in the NR-U and WiFi networks, respectively. Our results have shown that the uplink system throughput increases by over 100%, where cell throughput of NR-U network rises by 150%, and cell throughput of WiFi network decreases by 30%. To guarantee the cell throughput of WiFi network, we redesign the reward function to punish the agent when the cell throughput of WiFi network is below the threshold, and our revised design can still provide over 50% uplink system throughput gain.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the popularity of emerging data-hungry applications, including high-definition (HD) video surveillance, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, Uplink Centric Broadband Communication (UCBC) has been identified as new service class in the vision of 5.5G to cater for the exponentially growing uplink traffic volume, which leads to a tremendously heavy burden on the existing cellular network due to scarce licensed spectrum and downlink traffic-oriented design <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. To cope with the ever-increasing uplink traffic demand, the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has proposed to boost the uplink capacity by exploiting the unlicensed spectrum. In particular, the 3GPP has standardized Long Term Evolution (LTE) based technologies including LTE licensed-assisted access (LTE-LAA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> and enhanced LAA (eLAA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> to access the unlicensed spectrum since Release 13. Recently, New Radio Unlicensed (NR-U) network has been standardized to extend the applicability of New Radio (NR) to unlicensed spectrum in Release 16, which determines to support standalone operation mode over unlicensed spectrum <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Although the unlicensed spectrum is a promising solution to provide the cellular network with sufficient uplink spectrum resources, no exclusive rights are granted to any networks in the unlicensed spectrum, which means the NR-U network needs to coexist with the incumbent Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. To fairly and harmoniously coexist with the WiFi network, the NR-U network adopts the contention-based access scheme, called Listen Before Talk (LBT), to access the unlicensed spectrum, where the LBT scheme incorporates the Backoff procedure similar to the Carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) scheme in WiFi network.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">With the goal of improving the throughput over the unlicensed spectrum, the majority of efforts in previous works have been devoted to explicitly optimizing access control parameters using the formulated mathematical model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> have optimized the transmission time of the LBT scheme with fixed contention window size to maximize the number of devices with guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS), where the combinatorial and nonconvex problem is decomposed into two sub-problems to obtain the sub-optimal solution. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, the iterative algorithm has been proposed to optimize the time and power allocation, where devices are assumed to be able to detect each other without HN problem. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, the authors have proposed a hybrid duty-cycle and LBT access scheme over the unlicensed spectrum, where the contention window and duty-cycle time fraction are optimized via exhaustive searching method and iterative algorithm, respectively. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, the authors derived the optimal initial optimal Backoff window size, where Markov chain was utilized to obtain the successful transmission propobility in steady state. However, due to the mathematical complexity of the formulated non-convex problem, all these works optimized the access control parameters with the sub-optimal solution under the impractical assumption for simplicity.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To deal with more complex communication environment and practical formulations, Machine Learning (ML), especially Reinforcement Learning (RL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, emerges as a promising tool to optimize access control parameters over the unlicensed spectrum, due to that it solely relies on the self-learning of the environment interaction, without the need to derive explicit optimization solutions based on a complex mathematical model. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, each device can be controlled to transmit or remain silent in every slot based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Federated Learning (FL) approaches, where no NR-U network and HN problem are considered for simplicity. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, the authors have proposed to utilize the DRL to optimize the airtime fraction for LTE-LAA without considering the detailed LBT procedures. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, a duty-cycle free spectrum sharing framework has been designed, where the DRL algorithm is utilized to maximize the throughput via optimizing the LTE transmission time. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, the transmission time of frame-based LBT has been optimized via RL, where each device independently chooses the access technologies, including LTE, LTE-LAA, and WiFi. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, RL is combined with FL to optimize the contention window size of WiFi network with the aim to minimize the collision probability. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, the authors have proposed to adjust the contention window size with a minimum delay, where the neural network is utilized to predict the number of Negative Acknowledges (NACKs). In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed a multi-agent RL learning algorithm to optimize the access time and transmission time among Base Stations (BSs), where the mean field technology was utilized to solve the Nash Equilibrium (NE).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">However, the above learning-based access control solutions either focused on optimizing the backoff random number or the contention window size in the downlink transmission, without considering the Uplink Centric Broadband Communication (UCBC) over unlicensed spectrum. It is noted that optimizing the contention window size and backoff number fails to solve the hidden node and exposed node problems in the uplink transmission due to the following two reasons: 1) optimizing the contention window and backoff random number only changes the access time of NR-U UEs and WiFi STAs when the collision happens. The devices with fixed energy detection threshold will continue to identify the channel as idle and transmit data when the channel is occupied by other devices for a long time, which may still lead to collision; 2) each UE maintains a different contention window size and backoff number independently in the uplink transmission, which means optimizing the contention window size and backoff number in the uplink transmission requires much higher number of agents (i.e., proportional to the number of the UEs ) than the downlink (i.e., proportional to the number of BSs). Therefore, we propose federated reinforcement learning algorithm to dynamically optimize the common energy detection threshold adopted by all UEs. Furthermore, the existing works merely evaluated system throughput to indicate the network-centric performance, and ignored the user-centric Quality of Experience (QoE)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, which is more intuitive to reveal individual user experience in the UCBC.</p>

To do so, we develop DRL-based ED thresholds configuration approaches to dynamically optimize the uplink system throughput under the coexistence of NR-U and WiFi networks.

Two different NR-U uplink transmission procedures are considered according to the 3GPP standard <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, where the UE can either perform Category (Cat) 2 LBT or Cat4 LBT to transmit the packet.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the WiFi network, each STA performs the CSMA/CA to access the unlicensed channel once the new packets arrive, where the AP does not schedule the STA to transmit. Each WiFi STA accesses the channel independently, and transmits the uplink user data once it obtains the channel. However, in each NR-U cell, NR-U UEs are scheduled for uplink transmission in an centralized way, where each UE needs to be scheduled individually before transmitting the user data using the granted PUSCH resource. Therefore, there is only inter-cell interference between the NR-U UEs without intra-cell interference.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As the devices contend for the unlicensed spectrum without coordination, in both NR-U and WiFi networks, each device is required to perform Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) to sense the ongoing transmissions over the channel before its own transmission, where the sensed energy is compared with the fixed Energy Detection (ED) threshold to determine whether the channel is idle or busy. In other words, each device can only transmit when the channel is detected to be idle. However, the CCA procedure based on the fixed ED threshold cannot fully mitigate the throughput degradation due to the lack of coordination function among devices, which leads to the hidden node (HN) problem and exposed node (EN) problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>.</p>

Hence, two transmitters will send the packets simultaneously, which causes strong co-channel interference and transmission failure at receiver B. The EN problem happens when the transmitter C is prevented from sending packet to receiver D because of co-channel interference from the neighboring transmitter B (i.e., the sensed energy is higher than the ED threshold). However, receiver D could still receive the transmission from C with low interference because receiver D is far away from transmitter B, which leads to low spectral efficiency. Moreover, NR-U and WiFi networks adopt asymmetry ED thresholds (e.g., -72dBm in NR-U network and -62dBm in WiFi network), which makes the HN and EN problems even worse <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>. In a word, the high ED threshold setting enables multiple devices to transmit simultaneously, but may lead to stronger interference. On the contrary, the low ED threshold setting mitigates the probability of collision, but leads to low spectrum efficiency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>.</p>

Then, the scheduled UE is required to perform Cat2 or Cat4 LBT to transmit the user data based on its scheduled resource.

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">DRL is one of the most promising solutions to optimally solve complex POMDP problems, due to the reliance on the deep neural networks as one of the most powerful non-linear approximation functions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>. The related DRL algorithms have been widely used in the dynamic optimization for wireless communication systems, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>. However, they have been rarely studied in handling the ED thresholds configuration under the coexistence of heterogeneous NR-U and WiFi networks. Therefore, we design the centralized DRL and federated DRL in this section to evaluate the capability of DRL algorithm, respectively.</p>

However, it is usually impractical for heterogeneous NR-U and WiFi networks to share this information due to data privacy regulation and network architecture <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>.

Each agent only observes the number of successfully transmitted packets of its own system. During training, each agent reports the DQN parameters to the central server, and the central server calculates the averaged global parameters. Then each agent updates the parameters with the received global parameters. The basic workflow of federated DRL can be summarized in the following five steps:</p>

We can see that the average uplink system throughput of proposed centralized and federated DRL algorithms with gNB-Cat4/UE-Cat4 reaches around 65Mbps. However, the average uplink system throughput with gNB-Cat4/UE-Cat2 stabilizes only around 60Mbps. This is because the gNB has to reschedule the UE when the channel is busy during Cat2 LBT, which leads to unnecessary controlling overheads. We can also observe that the federated DRL algorithms converge faster than the centralized DRL algorithms due to the much smaller action space in the setting. More importantly, centralized-DQN may easily converge to the local optimal solution due to large action space. Therefore, we can observe that the federated-DQN achieves higher performance than the centralized-DQN algorithm. However, the training phase of federated DRL algorithms is more fluctuated due to the model parameters averaging between heterogeneous networks.</p>

This can be explained from two aspects: 1) NR-U network has advantages over WiFi network including higher data rate, larger COT length, centralized scheduling, etc; 2) Due to the advantages of NR-U network, it can contribute more significantly to the improvement of the system throughput. Therefore, we can see that NR-U network adopts the ED threshold around -57 dBm, which is higher than the -66 dBm of WiFi network. The higher ED threshold further enables the NR-U network to get more transmission opportunities.

Compared with gNB-Cat4/UE-Cat2 LBT scheme, we can see that the NR-U network achieves higher cell throughput around 61 Mbps, while the cell throughput of WiFi network is still around 6 Mbps. This is because the gNB is required to perform the Cat4 LBT to schedule the UE again when the UE detects the channel busy during Cat2 LBT. However, if the UE performs the Cat4 LBT, the UE can adopt the Backoff procedure to wait for the transmission opportunity, which leads to less controlling overheads. We can also observe that the ED thresholds of both centralized and federated DRL algorithms are lower than that of gNB-Cat4/UE-Cat2 LBT scheme. The reason is that the gNB-Cat4/UE-Cat-4 scheme can deal with the traffic more effectively, hence, the interference level is relatively lower.</p>

This is because the NR-U network can occupy the channel to transmit the packet more timely with a higher ED threshold. It is noted that the UPT of NR-U network in federated DRL is lower than that of centralized learning. However, the UPT of WiFi network in federated DRL is higher than that of centralized learning. The reason is that both NR-U and WiFi networks adopt higher ED thresholds in federated DRL. The interference level experienced by the NR-U network reaches its decoding capability limitation due to the high ED threshold.

We can see that the networks reach the stable state around 40 seconds under FTP-3 traffic, but the networks dynamically change over time under Beta traffic. Under FTP-3 traffic in the Fig. <a href="#S5.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ V-B Uplink System Throughput Optimization with Fairness ‣ V Simulation ‣ Federated Reinforcement Learning for Uplink Centric Broadband Communication Optimization over Unlicensed Spectrum" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>(a), we can see
that the cell throughput of NR-U network stabilizes around 31 Mbps, which is lower compared to the 58 Mbps in Fig. <a href="#S5.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ V-A Uplink System Throughput Optimization ‣ V Simulation ‣ Federated Reinforcement Learning for Uplink Centric Broadband Communication Optimization over Unlicensed Spectrum" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>.

This can be explained that the NR-U network adopts -71 dBm ED threshold, but WiFi network adopts a higher ED threshold around -64 dBm. Under Beta traffic in the Fig. <a href="#S5.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ V-B Uplink System Throughput Optimization with Fairness ‣ V Simulation ‣ Federated Reinforcement Learning for Uplink Centric Broadband Communication Optimization over Unlicensed Spectrum" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>(b), we can observe that the ED thresholds of NR-U and WiFi networks have a similar dynamic range from -65 dBm to -67 dBm. However, the cell throughput dynamic range of NR-U network is much larger than that of WiFi network. This is because the fixed -82 dBm CS threshold limits the transmission of WiFi network.</p>

Overall, we can see that the cell throughput of WiFi network is not sacrificed while improving the system throughput. Under FTP-3 traffic, we can see that the cell throughput of NR-U network increases from 16 Mbps to 31 Mbps with around 100% performance gain, and the cell throughput of WiFi network increases from 9.5 Mbps to 13 Mbps with performance gain over 35%. The system throughput increases from 25.5 Mbps to 44 Mbps, where the performance gain is over 70%. The performance gain of the system throughput decreases compared to the algorithm without considering the fairness due to the lower ED threshold in NR-U network, which indicates the effectiveness of the re-designed reward. We can observe that the UPT of NR-U network increases from 0.21 Mbps to around 0.43 Mbps with performance gain over 100%, which shows the re-designed reward has little influence on the UPT of NR-U network. However, UPT of WiFi network remains around 0.27 Mbps, which is a large improvement compared to the result without fairness. Under Beta traffic, we can see that the cell throughput performance gain of NR-U and WiFi networks are around 50%, and 30%, respectively, which leads to the system throughput gain around 48%.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we developed a novel centralized DRL framework and a federated DRL framework, respectively, to optimize the ED thresholds configuration for maximizing the uplink system throughput in UCBC under the coexistence of heterogeneous NR-U and WiFi networks. We first developed a centralized double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) algorithm for the dynamic ED thresholds configuration with an agent deployed at the central server, where two different uplink transmission schemes (i.e., gNB-Cat4/UE-Cat2 and gNB-Cat4/UE-Cat4) are considered. To protect the data privacy, we further developed a federated DDQN algorithm to dynamically optimize the ED thresholds for NR-U and WiFi networks, where two independent agents are deployed in the heterogeneous NR-U and WiFi networks and only exchange the model parameters with the central server, respectively. Furthermore, we re-designed
the reward function to guide the agent to guarantee the cell throughput of WiFi network while improving the uplink system throughput, where the agent gets punished when the cell throughput of WiFi network is below the pre-defined threshold. Finally, we introduced a user-centric performance metric called UPT to evaluate the file transmission throughput from the perspective of users.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our results demonstrated that our proposed DRL-based ED thresholds configuration approaches significantly outperform the benchmark scheme in terms of both uplink system throughput and UPT. Our numerical results shed light on that the NR-U network has inherent advantages over the WiFi network, including the data rate, MCOT length, scheduling policy, etc, which makes the fairness among heterogeneous networks to be an important problem to study.</p>
