<h6 class="ltx_title ltx_title_abstract">Abstract</h6>
<p id="id5.id1" class="ltx_p">Widely available healthcare services are now getting popular because of advancements in wearable sensing techniques and mobile edge computing. People’s health information is collected by edge devices such as smartphones and wearable bands for further analysis on servers, then send back suggestions and alerts for abnormal conditions. The recent emergence of federated learning allows users to train private data on local devices while updating models collaboratively. However, the heterogeneous distribution of the health condition data may lead to significant risks to model performance due to class imbalance. Meanwhile, as FL training is powered by sharing gradients only with the server, training data is almost inaccessible. The conventional solutions to class imbalance do not work for federated learning. In this work, we propose a new federated learning framework FedImT, dedicated to addressing the challenges of class imbalance in federated learning scenarios. FedImT contains an online scheme that can estimate the data composition during each round of aggregation, then introduces a self-attenuating iterative equivalent to track variations of multiple estimations and promptly tweak the balance of the loss computing for minority classes. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FedImT in solving the imbalance problem without extra energy consumption and avoiding privacy risks.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.2" class="ltx_p">With the wide adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile edge computing (MEC), wearable devices have become increasingly popular in healthcare for common citizens <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Wearable devices allowed more personal and efficient healthcare services for cheap manufacturing costs and designed privacy and security features such as data encryption or access controls <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Moreover, we can continuously obtain the body records of participants using edge devices (e.g. smartphones or wearables) equipped with various sensors and analyze data in real time <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. It has brought opportunities to enable emergency detection and assistance for abnormal health conditions. Early and immediate diagnosis of abnormal body conditions is essential for following medical treatments and saving lives in even more extreme situations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In order to accurately identify abnormal symptoms of users, machine learning methods were introduced into healthcare. Machine learning models rely on a large amount of natural sensing data from healthcare participants for training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. However, such demand for training data is often one of the main barriers to the adoption of intelligent healthcare. First, training in natural health data may lead to serious privacy concerns and legal risks for the sensitivity of personally identifiable information. In terms of existing data protection and privacy laws, the <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">2016 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</em> from the European Union (EU) considered personal health data as a special category of sensitive data requiring additional protection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Healthcare providers were forced to ensure that they have a lawful basis for processing such data while limiting data sharing. What’s more, data from diverse sources are stored in silos in the current healthcare system. Those data with different formats and locations pose challenges for organizations that are looking to use machine learning to gain insights without sharing available training data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Lastly, considering the limited performance and battery of wearable edge devices, the overhead of transferring the raw data obtained from the sensors to the central server is a non-negligible cost.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The emergence of federated learning (FL), together with MEC and IoT, has provided a viable solution for smart wearable healthcare. In particular, FL allowed a collaborative learning scheme without data sharing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Each party of FL trains the model using its own data and then sends the updated model parameters to a central server, where the weights are aggregated as the initial values for the next round <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. FL protects user privacy fundamentally since the original data is always retained locally during the whole training process. Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 INTRODUCTION ‣ An Efficient Imbalance-Aware Federated Learning Approach for Wearable Healthcare with Autoregressive Ratio Observation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> demonstrates a typical structure of FL based healthcare system. MEC meanwhile, has provided ample computational power to the well-trained models running locally. As a result, detection results can be inferred and sent back to users within seconds by edge devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">For nowadays FL applications, one of the main challenges is that data from most clients usually own their own personalized styles and preferences, and this leads to heterogeneity among models trained by different clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. The resulting diversity may not merely slow down the aggregated model convergence but also decrease the precision <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. As a prime representative of data heterogeneity, the phenomenon of class imbalance is frequently seen in many real-world scenes, especially in healthcare and medicine fields <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Class imbalance refers to the situation when one class of a binary or multi-class classification problem has significantly fewer instances than the other class or classes, it is widely considered a fundamental and generic issue for health data. For example, even in patients with severe heart disease, their heart rate is abnormal for only a fraction of the whole duration, leading to majority class samples making up a significant amount of the total training data, whereas minority class samples account for a considerably smaller portion. The direct consequence of class imbalance is that models may ignore the accuracy of minority classes and concentrate on getting most samples processed correctly. However, in many practical scenarios, these minority classes are actually the targets that need to be found. Wearable healthcare devices also are expected to be more sensitive to abnormal situations than normal <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Giving alarms in time for a sudden emergency is much more important than creating daily health reports.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In the structure of conventional machine learning, imbalanced distribution is not a big challenge. A number of approaches have been proposed to balance the ratio of majority and minority classes. However, in FL training processes, only the gradients and model parameters are allowed to be transferred between clients and the server. FL is always running with mechanisms to protect participant privacy and restrict the server from accessing any private information including distributions and classes ratio <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. These mechanisms prevent users from addressing class imbalance with existing approaches of machine learning due to a lack of global knowledge. Data imbalance is hard to solve by clients alone since the mismatch between the local data distribution and the global distribution may impose an even more negative side-effect on the aggregated model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Duan et al. proposed a solution that directly addresses the class imbalance among clients by collecting local data distributions of each client with proxy servers, which leads to a potential risk of exposing latent back doors to attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. Zhang et al. pointed out that prior knowledge collected by the server also contains personal privacy while a client with more positive samples is more likely to correspond to a user with poor health, and then proposed a bottom-up method to schedule local updates by the client itself with deep reinforcement learning, which achieved further protection of privacy but the computational consumption of clients may become much higher <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. Wang et al. designed a monitor scheme for class imbalance in FL that estimates selected data composition at each aggregation round, which addressed the imbalance issue without adding too much computation cost <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. However, in practical scenarios of FL, prior knowledge or global distributions are not always set in stone. Hospitals tend not to wear a sensor on only one patient at all times, and a disease pandemic can increase the number of positive samples sharply and fall back in a short period of time. To our knowledge, there is no work that simultaneously protects participant privacy, including prior knowledge, and resolves distribution mismatch between the global server and client sides even when the mismatch keeps varying.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In our view, we considered FL for wearable healthcare as a task that is always in training. The users keep producing new data in their daily lives, so happening class imbalance is always a possibility. It is in some ways an online learning task that wearable devices may not have enough space to store too much historical data. Constantly updated and obsolete data makes it difficult to obtain stable prior knowledge of all the clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. In this work, we tackled the mentioned challenges. We viewed each aggregation of the FL model as an opportunity to observe the global data distribution and designed an approach to estimate the sample composition of selected clients by comparing updated gradients of clients with gradients computed by auxiliary data in the central server. However, It is difficult to obtain accurate global knowledge for a single observation of selected clients, summarizing multiple observations in iterations and calculating the mean can improve the accuracy of the estimation but may induce the common model in the wrong direction in the event of a varying global distribution. In order to detect the dynamic class imbalance, we proposed an autoregressive ratio estimation function inspired by the Kalman filter to amplify the proportion of later observations in the average results while maintaining stability and accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">In the proposed framework named FedImT (Federated Imbalance Track), inspired by the monitor scheme to class imbalance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, we first estimated the proportion of each class in the selected clients at each aggregation round of the FL model without asking clients to upload any private prior information. If the estimated ratio shows a significant mismatch with previous estimations, we would drop the gradients update this round but still conduct ratio observation iteration to track the changes in the global distribution. Finally, the model would be updated with a balanced Cross-Entropy loss with the observed composition knowledge, and the severe mismatch between the global and local data distribution is prevented from occurring during the entire update process. We compared FedImT with the advanced FL baselines for healthcare services. The results show that our approach achieves a significant performance against varying imbalanced data distribution while avoiding apparent extra computational overhead.</p>

As the computing performance of various edge devices increases, healthcare based on MEC and IoT technology has established itself as a component of everyday life <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. People can easily track their own health conditions with smartphones and other wearable devices. The body activities are collected from the sensors equipped on these smart devices and processed by the devices immediately. Participants should be informed right once if any abnormal symptoms are detected. MEC-based smart healthcare services have rapidly evolved in recent years. Latha et al. proposed a heart disease prediction model partially observable Markov decision process using fog computing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.

In this work, we contribute to MEC-powered healthcare by designing an FL system for edge devices providing full privacy protection while training deep models for detecting abnormal symptoms and is robust to the class imbalance issue of health data even when the ratios of certain classes keep varying.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FL is an emerging distributed approach that allows multiple clients or participants to collaboratively train a model without sharing their private data with a central server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Instead of sending data to a central location for storage and processing, the model is trained locally on each device, and only the updated model parameters are sent back to a central aggregator. FL allows data to be maintained on individual devices rather than being shared over a network, which makes it particularly helpful in circumstances where data privacy is an issue. Additionally, because each device can contribute its own distinct data to the training process, it enables the convergence of models on a wider and more varied set of data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Due to reliable privacy protection, FL is a nice fit for wearable healthcare where the training data consists of a large number of sensitive health conditions and personal biological signals of participants <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. A groundbreaking effort in this direction is FedHealth<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, which developed an FL framework to aggregate models locally trained models from various sources and produced a personalized model using transfer learning. However, FedHealth was not designed for imbalanced environments where the ratio of positive samples may be extremely small. Another work that deserves to be highlighted is Astraea from Duan et al <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. In Astrea, an approach to self-balancing data sampling that was committed to tackling the issue of class imbalance in order to increase model correctness and robustness. However, Astrea presupposed that the global server is aware of the class distributions of every participant, which exposes training data to various inference attacks and contradicted the participants’ increasing requirements for privacy. FedSens is also a remarkable work where a bottom-up method was proposed to avoid uploading private information as well as prior knowledge to the central server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. In FedSens, the frequency of local updates is controlled by multi-agent deep reinforcement learning models on the client side. As a result, clients with more minority samples are instructed to execute more local updates as energy consumption allows. Although FedSens proved to be a significant progress compared to previous algorithms, its performance for scenarios with much more clients is not yet tested, and it is not able to respond instantly to variations in the global ratio. Consequently, it is essential to develop an imbalance-aware approach for identifying and addressing the class imbalance issue in FL but posing no threat to data privacy.</p>

<div id="S2.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In centralized machine learning, models often demand a large quantity of correctly labeled training data for optimizing their parameters. The problem of class imbalance is not a rare occurrence in many practical scenarios, e.g. object detection. Lin et al. analyzed the causes of one-stage detectors’ accuracy inferior to two-stage detectors in the object detection field and pointed out it is due to class imbalance. We know that in the object detection process, an input image may contain thousands of candidate locations, but only a few of them include objects, which introduces class imbalance to model training. The authors then proposed Focal loss to reduce the gradient decent reward of major easy negative samples <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. Prior methods to address class imbalance have basically followed one of the following philosophies: One is to increase the quantity of the samples as minority classes. such approaches leverage data resampling and data augmentation. DeVries et al. proposed a simple yet effective data augmentation technique called cutout, which involves randomly masking out rectangular sections of input images during training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. Deep reinforcement learning ways were also introduced to data augmentation by AutoAugment to search for the optimal augmentation policies for a given dataset and model architecture and achieved state-of-the-art performance on various image classification tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. Another idea is to relatively raise the cost of model misclassification for minority samples, which is also known as cost-sensitive learning methods. Cost-Sensitive Deep Feature Representation is one of the representative cost-sensitive learning works in recent years which proposed a two-stage approach to extract cost-sensitive representations for balanced training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. The first is a data-level solution to class imbalance while the other addresses this issue by modifying algorithms and models. Of course, there are also approaches that solve imbalances from both data and algorithm aspects.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, due to the privacy concern of FL, few of the existing techniques can perform well in FL scenes. Obviously, we are prohibited from oversampling or copying data across the clients and those totally healthy participants may have absolutely no abnormal conditions recorded on their devices. Loss functions like Balanced Cross Entropy may help mitigate the class imbalance problem but it requires knowledge of the overall ratio <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, which may threaten privacy. Allowing each client to train separately in a balanced manner is likely to lead to a severe mismatch. In our opinion, in order to hedge against the risk of privacy leakage, participants are forbidden to share either raw data or ratio information with other parties (including the server, the proxy server, and other participants). This strict requirement for privacy demands new approaches to address imbalance issues.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we first formulate the problem of FL based wearable healthcare system, our expectation is that it can perform well towards varying imbalanced distributed data while meeting the privacy requirements of participants. The system is defined by a standard FedAvg structure and procedure <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. After that, we presented our method to estimate the composition ratio of data from selected clients in a single aggregation round, and then introduced an autoregressive function to track its variations. We update this global model using a dynamic re-weighted balanced Cross-Entropy loss. The system overview is presented in the last subsection.</p>

In each round of FedAvg updates, the algorithm can be divided into three steps. First, the server shares the global model with the clients as initial weights. Then, the clients train their own models for certain epochs with local data and send back their updates. At last, the server aggregates the received weights based on the sample quantity of each client, to generate an updated global model for the next round <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>

The system consists of four slave workers and a master server. These workers including common personal digital devices or wearables, play the role of clients in FL. We assumed that these slave workers are equipped with various necessary sensors and capable of performing local training on their own collected data. The master server can be deployed with any nearby node in the network such as base stations, smart routers, or even gateways. The server in FL does not have a strong need for computing ability for its low computational overhead, and more often than not, lower latency and more reliable connections matter more for the server.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In the present deep learning methods, samples are not fed into the model one by one, but using mini-batch training. All data is divided into small batches of a fixed and defined size, each batch is applied to update the model parameters in the direction of minimizing prediction errors. In the vast majority of cases nowadays, the batch size is typically chosen to be a power of 2, such as 32, 64, or 128, to take advantage of the parallel processing capabilities of GPUs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>. As GPU productivity has continued to improve over the years and memory has increased dramatically, there has been a trend towards larger batch sizes.</p>

However, abnormal states of physical health conditions usually appear in periods, which means the distribution of samples is not uniform in the time dimension. Only training with a fixed size of the latest data may lead to the composition ratio for all classes of training data keeping varying strongly. The following content of this paper proposed an autoregressive function to help track the varying imbalance of data and solved the issue by re-balancing the weights of the loss function before each FL training round.</p>

There are some obvious benefits to this setting. recently collected data are more relevant and representative of the current state of participants, which meets our demand for more responsive detections. Moreover, we considered an FL healthcare system as a scheme that is always in training, where new data is constantly collected by clients. In this way, training with the entire data actually lets old data join more local updates in the whole training procedure, which may hurt robustness and precision.</p>

On the client side <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, the happening distribution of abnormal health conditions is not uniform in the timeline. Once a person is detected with an accelerated heart rate, the painful and nervous condition usually lasts a while before ending, and so are human activities and emotions.

From general experience, as the training process progresses, taking multiple measurements and calculating an average value can help improve accuracy. However, the ratio inside each client also faces variations. Average calculation obviously does not take into account the underlying dynamics.

<p id="S4.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">First of all, MNIST has been widely considered a general task for benchmarking and evaluating machine learning algorithms, particularly in the context of image classification tasks. MNIST is always being used as a starting point for testing and comparing different models due to its simplicity and quick experimentation feature. In order to introduce class imbalance and data heterogeneity to MNIST, we first grouped all the samples by their labels, then divided them into shards, and subsequently, these shards were randomly dispatched to a variety of clients. We noticed that this operation caused a significant class mismatch among clients. Due to that FL systems often chose only a part of participant clients for aggregation each round, and the data composition of each round was also of obvious imbalance.</p>

We would train the MNIST task for 50 rounds, with 10 local rounds. As for the UCI-HAR and The Ford Challenge, the global round would be up to 80 rounds for better convergence. The auxiliary data was obtained by randomly selecting a number of samples of each class with putting-back from the training set. In practical scenarios, it can be acquired from public data or synthesized by generative models. If the training data for the FL system as a whole does not change considerably, this auxiliary data can be used for a long period. The size of the auxiliary data set in our experiments was 4 batches. In the MNIST task, we created 50 clients for FL training while the number of participants would be consistent with raw data in the other two case studies.</p>

Our algorithm can achieve similar performance with several state-of-the-art approaches.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed FedImT, an efficient imbalance-aware federated learning framework. FedImT was designed to meet the requirements of scenarios like medical intelligence or wearable healthcare, which have high privacy concerns and significant class imbalance issues. FedImT inherited the standard structure of FedAvg, where the server estimates the training data composition during each round of model aggregation, then autoregressions its estimation to form a stable and precise knowledge of the composition of training data. The loss computation would keep being re-balanced by such autoregressive estimation without the negative impact of class imbalance. The results demonstrated that FedImT achieves significant performance gains compared to representative baselines in terms of improved model accuracy and practicality.</p>
