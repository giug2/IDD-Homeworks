<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Over the recent years, Federated machine learning continues to gain interest and momentum where there is a need to draw insights from data while preserving the data provider’s privacy. However, one among other existing challenges in the adoption of federated learning has been the lack of fair, transparent and universally agreed incentivization schemes for rewarding the federated learning contributors. Smart Contracts on a Blockchain network provide transparent, immutable and independently verifiable proofs by all participants of the network. We leverage this open and transparent nature of smart contracts on a blockchain to define incentivization rules for the contributors, which is based on a novel scalar quantity - federated contribution. Such a smart contract based reward-driven model has the potential to revolutionize the federated learning adoption in enterprises. Our contribution is two-fold: first is to show how smart contract based blockchain can be a very natural communication channel for federated learning. Second, leveraging this infrastructure, we can show how an intuitive measure of each agents’ contribution can be built and integrated with the life cycle of the training and reward process.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The concept of <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">federated machine learning</span> was introduced around 2016<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. It relies on the principle of remote and distributed execution of machine learning algorithm, and the ability to share and aggregate individual models in a secure and anonymous manner. Therefore, it is implicit that federated machine learning would depend on availability of secure communication channels between remote participants to allow distribution of locally trained individual models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Blockchain</span> became popular with launch of bitcoin around 2009<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Blockchain is a form of distributed ledger technology that relies on honest majority members in a network to validate the accuracy of the executed transactions on the network. It accomplishes this by allowing each of its members to execute a piece of turing complete software code (a.k.a smart contract), in an independent fashion without any external influence or interventions. Although the proposed solution could be extended to other Blockchains, this paper focuses primarily on Ethereum’s implementation. Therefore, Blockchains can help the deployment of federated learning by both bringing dataset on a unique, structured, ledger (with potential privacy layers on it), and by guaranteeing the security, accuracy and correctness of the distribution of the model’s parameters. This could be of particular value in compliance and anti-money laundering cases requiring the reconciliation of multiple sensible dataset, and in which the use of fraud and anomaly detection models could improve manual audits and investigations<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, because of the distributed nature of validation, in current blockchains, unless it implements a privacy layer, all communications between any two nodes is visible to rest of the nodes of the network. Preserving privacy of transaction in a blockchain, while still allowing all nodes to participate in consensus process is a difficult problem to solve. This is an active area of research, and includes technologies such as Zero Knowledge Proof (<span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">zKP</span>). The foundations of <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">zKP</span> is based on interactive proofs, as described in previous works<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. However, setup of those continues to be an onerous process, in real world implementation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">This poses a challenge for federated learning, that requires maintaining the privacy of the individual participant’s machine learning models (and model gradients too) and anonymity of the model contributor. The proposed implementation solves this challenge via dynamically generating asymmetric and symmetric keys for each federated learning round ( details to follow in subsequent sections), with a caveat that the aggregation server node is conceptually akin to a Trusted Execution Environment (TEEs), but at a consortium level<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">However, even with consortium trusted aggregation server implementation, the risk of lack of contribution in the overall federated learning rounds from individual nodes continues to exist. In addition, the malicious nodes could potentially send a misleading model that could skew the efficacy of the aggregated models. One of the potential ways to address the above challenges could be to have the aggregation server detect somehow, such behavior and drop those contributors from the collaboration process. Unfortunately, this solution tends to centralizes the solution and lack of transparency in the overall process.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The current paper proposes a solution to avoid the above potential pitfalls by leveraging unique and transparent smart contracts design on blockchain to reward honest/active ( and penalize malicious/under performing) participants in the learning process, based on computing a novel, scalar quantity - <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">federated contribution</span>. In our proposed solution, smart contract is responsible for reward ( or penalty) specification and distribution (or fees) as well, through immutable federated contribution records on blockchain.</p>

Authors have discussed the approach of using ‘deletion method’ for horizontal federated learning approach, where the change in testing accuracy is considered by various iterations of training, with each iteration, we remove the data points from a single client. This way, we measure the degradation in model performance, and then infer the contributions accordingly by the federated clients. In case of vertical federated learning, Shapley values are computed for each feature. Shapley values gives a strong quantification of each feature’s importance, followed by a mathematical approach of inferring contributions of parties in vertical federated learning. There are, however, a multiplicity of ways in which the Shapley value can be implemented, with very disparate results, as shown in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.

Based on the contribution record from blockchain, a given participant would be either rewarded or penalized through on-chain blockchain tokens, or through off-chain mechanism established by consortium.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A well-known constraint of existing blockchain implementations are around performance, usually measured in throughput and latency. Further, current Blockchain implementations also suffer from Blockchian Trilema ( a coin termed by Vitalik Buterin) - speed, security and decentralization. These constraints are quite true and applicable for high volume, low latency networks where speed of transaction is quite critical. However, sharing models over blockchain in an enterprise network does not require significant high throughput sine the frequency of model updates is expected to be relatively low. In addition, latency is also not a critical factor since aggregation of models from each participant are not necessarily time sensitive. For example, if a model update was missed by the aggregation server in one aggregation cycle, it will be picked up in the subsequent one without losing its impact.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the previous sections, we discussed about how blockchain ensures required security and privacy at its core. Though data on blockchain is immutable, the privacy is not guaranteed, because of the very nature of how blockchain works. A consortium network with enterprise participants, there is a high possibility of participants not comfortable with revealing their model weight gradients to peer participants. If local model weights (<span id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">and gradients</span>) are revealed, this posses risk of revealing statistical properties of the data from individual participant, if not the actual data.</p>

<div id="S3.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In order to privately send model weights from participant to federated server on blockchain, in a consortium network, asymmetric encryption using <span id="S3.SS3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">RSA</span> cryptography is proposed in the paper. Each new federated learning round is published as blockchain event, federated aggregation server generates a new set of RSA key pair. The private key of the pair stays with the server, as this will be used by the server in later stages to decrypt the encrypted event message cipher. The public key is sent across the network to all the participants. Participant will generate an AES key for encrypting local train model, and then use the public key received from federated server to encrypt the AES key<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. With RSA keys revolving for every new federated learning round, this decreases the chances of compromising model information over the blockchain, for any given participant on the network. One thing to note here is - only the the event data containing participant’s local model weights needs to be encrypted. Other event data like global model, which is sent from server to clients, initiation of federated round broadcast does not require encryption, as it does not contain sensitive data among the peers in blockchain network.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the previous sections, smart contracts have been described as a way of executing Turing complete programs on blockchains. Further, as referred in related work, Ethereum smart contracts also have a concept of events, which are generated after a transaction is mined on the Blockchain network. Events can carry additional information and parameters that can be used by subscribing applications. It is important to understand that events generated, when published by the participants or the federated server, would be a broadcast. Dynamically generated encryption keys, explained in earlier section would safeguard the privacy interest of the federated clients.

The computation to determine the contribution of individual in the federated learning round (<span id="S3.SS4.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">described in subsequent section</span>) is performed off the blockchain, considering the resource and computation constraints. After the computation is completed, the records are published on blockchain, <span id="S3.SS4.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">anonymously</span>, for each participant to consume.

In order to tackle the challenge, we are proposing a novel way of computing a novel scalar quantity, <span id="S4.p1.2.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">federated contribution</span> across the network, and using smart contract to publish and store on the blockchain (as discussed in earlier section). As compared to earlier work<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, federated contribution establishes a way to define contribution of each participant in federated learning setting, whether they might have train data of similar statistical properties, or non overlapping (<span id="S4.p1.2.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">orthogonal in feature space</span>) statistical properties.</p>

This intuitively can be thought as - the divergence of local model after training on new data points will be more, if higher gradient descent updates are performed. This can be because of variance in new data, use of better data points for local training rounds or greater training size. In case of divergence being relatively smaller, one can infer about participant using noisy or unrelated data points, which may not be acceptable for global federated model. Our framework would thus point at a possible way to fix a key limitation of the Shapley value framework (which we hope to build the link with in a future paper) - the fact that it only provides valuations for points within a fixed data set, and does not account for statistical aspects of the data and does not give a way to reason about points outside the data set.</p>

Within this network, one of the node acts as federated aggregation server, and other three nodes act as federated clients. It is a consortium blockchain setup, with each individual client nodes own set of data. Figure <a href="#S5.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ V Experiments ‣ Federated Learning using Smart Contracts on Blockchain, based on Reward Driven Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> shows the architecture representation of the proposed experimental setup. The federated server node runs a python daemon process which listens to the events generated by smart contracts on the network. Upon receipt of events and based on event types, it either sends the global model to every node as a broadcast, or computes the aggregated version of the global model with latest gradients of local training, from individual federated clients. On federated clients, a similar python application is being executed, which listens to events and sends the encrypted local model, as required. It also acts as a service, which serves (<span id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">exposing remote REST based endpoint, which can be consumed by any other program to predict, based on input data</span>) machine learning model, and also is responsible for re-training of new batch of data points. The applications, which are responsible for directly interacting with blockchain nodes are termed as “dApp”, as depicted in figure <a href="#S5.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ V Experiments ‣ Federated Learning using Smart Contracts on Blockchain, based on Reward Driven Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, which essentially means decentralized applications.</p>

Two smart contracts, one for communication and one for contribution is deployed on the blockchain.

<p id="S5.SS4.p1.2" class="ltx_p">Based on the data, blockchain network with smart contracts and neural network architecture described in earlier sections, we performed various experiments to test our hypothesis of computing federated contribution against various settings like higher contribution of a smaller group of participants, lower contributions by a subset of participants, noise in local data, while training by individual nodes.

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In our paper, we studied our proposal of using smart contracts to establish a fair, transparent, secure and immutable incentivization mechanism in a consortium blockchain network for federated learning. We proposed a novel approach to calculate a unique scalar quantity, <span id="S6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">federated contribution</span>, which quantifies the contribution of each participant in federated learning. Federated contribution is compatible with the machine learning algorithms which relies on weight parameters computed by gradient descents. We justified our proposed approach both empirically and theoretically. For future work in the given area, one can extend the federated contribution to non-gradient descents algorithms, or to heterogeneous federated learning. In the proposed method of calculating federated contribution, and using the relative federated contribution values for reward (or penalization) mechanism, we validated that it effectively penalizes under-performing participants, rewards over-performing participants and penalizing participants with noisy or malicious data points. This justifies our proposal of considering federated contribution as an adequate mechanism of quantifying participants’ contribution in the consortium blockchain network. Future work will aim at building further the conceptual bridge between our weight-based contribution measure and Shapley values, under modified axioms that reflect the specificities of federated machine learning settings.</p>
