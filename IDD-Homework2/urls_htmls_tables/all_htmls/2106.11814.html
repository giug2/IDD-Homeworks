<p id="id2.2" class="ltx_p">Cross-silo federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning approach where clients of the same interest train a global model cooperatively while keeping their local data private. The success of a cross-silo FL process requires active participation of many clients. Different from cross-device FL, clients in cross-silo FL are usually organizations or companies which may execute multiple cross-silo FL processes repeatedly due to their time-varying local data sets, and aim to optimize their long-term benefits by selfishly choosing their participation levels. While there has been some work on incentivizing clients to join FL, the analysis of clients’ long-term selfish participation behaviors in cross-silo FL remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we analyze the selfish participation behaviors of heterogeneous clients in cross-silo FL. Specifically, we model clients’ long-term selfish participation behaviors as an infinitely repeated game, with the stage game being a selfish participation game in one cross-silo FL process (SPFL). For the stage game SPFL, we derive the unique Nash equilibrium (NE), and propose a distributed algorithm for each client to calculate its equilibrium participation strategy. We show that at the NE, clients fall into at most three categories: (i) <em id="id2.2.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">free riders</em> who do not perform local model training, (ii) a unique <em id="id2.2.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">partial contributor</em> (if exists) who performs model training with part of its local data, and (iii) <em id="id2.2.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">contributors</em> who perform model training with all their local data. The existence of free riders has a detrimental effect on achieving a good global model and sustaining other clients’ long-term participation. For the long-term interactions among clients, we derive a cooperative strategy for clients which minimizes the number of free riders while increasing the amount of local data for model training. We show that enforced by a punishment strategy, such a cooperative strategy is a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium (SPNE) of the infinitely repeated game, under which some clients who are free riders at the NE of the stage game choose to be (partial) contributors. We further propose an algorithm to calculate the optimal SPNE which minimizes the number of free riders while maximizing the amount of local data for model training. Simulation results show that our derived optimal SPNE can effectively reduce the number of free riders by up to <math id="id1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="99.3\%" display="inline"><semantics id="id1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="id1.1.m1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="id1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">99.3</mn><mo id="id1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="float" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.2">99.3</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id1.1.m1.1c">99.3\%</annotation></semantics></math> and increase the amount of local data for model training by up to <math id="id2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="82.3\%" display="inline"><semantics id="id2.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="id2.2.m2.1.1" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mn id="id2.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">82.3</mn><mo id="id2.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id2.2.m2.1b"><apply id="id2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="id2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="float" id="id2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1.2">82.3</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id2.2.m2.1c">82.3\%</annotation></semantics></math>.</p>

User data is of paramount importance for artificial intelligence (AI). With sufficient user data, banks can develop AI models for customized financial advice and risk control services, and hospitals can train AI-assisted diagnosis and treatment models. Traditional machine learning approaches usually collect large amounts of raw data and train AI models on a central server, which may lead to privacy leakage. In order to protect data privacy, Google proposed federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, which is a distributed learning approach without sharing raw data.</p>

In the local training steps, each client trains the model by using its local data, and then sends the updated model to the central server. In the global aggregation steps, the central server aggregates the updates and sends the aggregated global model back to clients for the next iteration. The iterations stop until a predefined stopping criterion is satisfied.</p>

In cross-device FL, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1.sf1" title="In Figure 1 ‣ 1.1 Background and Motivations ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Enabling Long-Term Cooperation in Cross-Silo Federated Learning: A Repeated Game Perspective" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1(a)</span></a>, the central server initiates the FL process, and clients are devices who perform local training using their local data.

<p id="S1.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we study cross-silo FL, which has a wide range of practical applications. For example, WeBank and Swiss Re cooperatively perform data analysis for finance and insurance services <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. NVIDIA Clara helps hospitals with different data sets train AI models by FL for mammogram assessment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. MELLODDY uses cross-silo FL to speed up drug research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. In cross-silo FL, many clients who have the same interest (e.g., training models for finance service or medical diagnosis) train a global model cooperatively, and hence usually can achieve a better model compared with the ones trained only locally <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Despite the popular applications of cross-silo FL seen in practice, there is little work analyzing clients’ participation behaviors in cross-silo FL theoretically, which is the focus of this paper.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In cross-silo FL, since clients usually belong to different entities (e.g., companies or organizations), each client may behave selfishly to maximize its own benefit. Specifically, each client selfishly chooses its participation level (i.e., the amount of local data) for the local training steps. The total amount of local data chosen by all clients will affect the global model accuracy, while the model training leads to costs to clients. In practice, clients have heterogeneous valuations for global model accuracy and incur different computation costs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Therefore, clients will make a tradeoff between the achieved global model accuracy and the incurred cost. For example, clients with high valuations for global model accuracy and low computation costs may choose a high participation level to achieve a good global model accuracy. On the other hand, clients with low valuations for global model accuracy and high computation costs may choose not to perform local training to reduce the cost, and we call such clients as <em id="S1.SS1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">free riders</em>. This motivates us to study clients’ selfish participation behaviors in cross-silo FL through a game-theoretic approach. In this paper, we aim at addressing the following fundamental question in cross-silo FL.</p>

</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Different from cross-device FL, cross-silo FL usually involves long-term repeated interactions among clients. For example, the MELLODDY project is a long-term project which involves repeated interactions among 17 partners. One reason is that clients’ local data may change over time, and hence clients will perform multiple cross-silo FL processes repeatedly to adapt the global model to the time-varying local data sets. For example, hospitals constantly admit new patients and collect treatment data of these cases. Furthermore, different from cross-device FL where the central server chooses different devices to perform different FL tasks and devices aim to maximize their short-term benefits, in cross-silo FL, the same set of clients initiate FL processes repeatedly and train the global model cooperatively. Moreover, clients (e.g., organizations or companies) are usually far-sighted and aim to maximize their long-term benefits. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze clients’ long-term interactions in cross-silo FL. However, the existence of free riders is detrimental to the global model for the following two reasons. First, when many clients choose to be free riders, the amount of local data for model training is small, which leads to a bad global model accuracy. Second, the behavior of free riders is unfair to the clients who use their local data to perform local trainings, which will disrupt clients’ long-term cooperation. To sustain clients’ long-term cooperation in cross-silo FL, we need to reduce the number of free riders. This motivates us to address the second fundamental question in cross-silo FL.</p>

<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we analyze clients’ participation behaviors in cross-silo FL through a game-theoretic approach. We consider an infinite time horizon which is divided into many time slots, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 1.1 Background and Motivations ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Enabling Long-Term Cooperation in Cross-Silo Federated Learning: A Repeated Game Perspective" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. We model the interactions among clients in the infinite time horizon as a repeated game with the stage game being the selfish participation game in one cross-silo FL process (SPFL) in each time slot. Specifically, in each time slot, clients perform one cross-silo FL process which proceeds in several iterations of local training steps and global aggregation steps. Each time slot can be one month for banks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> or one week for hospitals <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Since the local data may change dynamically over time (e.g., banks update the finance data sets monthly or even weekly <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, and hospitals update the clinical data sets weekly <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>), clients need to repeatedly perform cross-silo FL processes to adapt the global model to the dynamic local data.

Note that our proposed algorithms later in the paper which calculate the equilibrium strategy for each client do not require such information. The analysis in the complete information setting provides useful insights for practical cross-silo FL systems. For the analysis of the incomplete information setting, we will leave it as future work.</span></span></span></p>

Since clients in cross-silo FL are companies or organizations, the data transmission between clients and the central server can be through either wired networks (e.g., through the high-speed wired connections <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>) or wireless networks (e.g., using transmission protocols TDMA, OFDMA or NOMA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>).

<p id="S3.SS2.p7.1" class="ltx_p">At equilibrium, however, clients with low valuation-computation ratios may choose to be free riders. This is a result of the tradeoff between the model accuracy loss and the computation cost. Specifically, given the global model aggregated from the local models of the (partial) contributors, clients with low valuation-computation ratios choose not to perform local trainings to avoid the computation costs. The behaviors of free riders only minimize their own costs, but cannot improve the global model accuracy.

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we analyze the long-term interactions among clients in cross-silo FL processes. We model clients’ selfish participation behaviors as a repeated game in the infinite time horizon, with the stage game being the SPFL (i.e., Game 1). We first model the repeated game, and then derive a cooperative participation strategy that can minimize the number of free riders while increasing the amount of local data for model training. We derive a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium (SPNE) of the repeated game which enforces the cooperative participation strategy by a punishment strategy. Finally, we propose an algorithm to calculate the optimal SPNE that can minimize the number of free riders while maximizing the amount of local data for model training.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.2" class="ltx_p">In this work, we analyze clients’ selfish participation behaviors in cross-silo FL. We model the interactions among clients in a single cross-silo FL process as a selfish participation game and derive its unique Nash equilibrium. We show that clients’ selfish participation behaviors lead to free riders at equilibrium. The existence of free riders hampers clients’ long-term participation in cross-silo FL. We model clients’ interactions in the long-term cross-silo FL processes as a repeated game. We derive the optimal SPNE that can minimum the number of free riders while maximizing the amount of local data for model training. Simulation results show that our derived optimal SPNE can effectively reduce the number of free riders by up to <math id="S6.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="99.3\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">99.3</mn><mo id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="float" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">99.3</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1c">99.3\%</annotation></semantics></math> and increase the amount of data for training by up to <math id="S6.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="82.3\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p1.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">82.3</mn><mo id="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p1.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="float" id="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.2">82.3</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p1.2.m2.1c">82.3\%</annotation></semantics></math>. For future work, it is interesting to analyze the interactions among clients in the incomplete information scenario where clients do not know the participation strategies of other clients or in the asymmetric information scenario where the valuation for global model accuracy and the computation cost coefficient are the private information of each client.</p>

of each client at the same time, so all client will not cooperate and play the NE of the stage game. The reason of this situation is clients has low valuation for the accuracy of the global model. With the increase of training data, the local model is good enough and the global model has small improvement. The reduction of accuracy loss is very small (i.e., the difference of accuracy loss between the NE of stage game and cooperative strategy of repeated game), while the impact of computation cost is very significant. Any increase in data will lead to the increase of total cost.</p>
