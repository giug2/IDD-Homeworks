<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) with quantization and deliberately added noise over wireless networks is a promising approach to preserve user differential privacy while reducing wireless resources.
Specifically, an FL learning process can be fused with quantized Binomial mechanism-based updates contributed by multiple users to reduce the communication overhead/cost and to protect the privacy of participating users.
However, optimizing quantization parameters, communication resources (e.g., transmit power, bandwidth, and quantization bits), and the added noise to guarantee the differential privacy requirement and performance of the learned FL model remains an open and challenging problem.
This article aims to jointly optimize the level of quantization, parameters of the Binomial mechanism, and communication resources so as to maximize the convergence rate under the constraints of the wireless network and differential privacy (DP) requirement.
To that end, we first derive a novel DP budget estimation of the FL with quantization and Binomial noise that is tighter than the state-of-the-art bound.
We then analyze the relationship between the convergence rate and the transmit power, the bandwidth, the transmission time, and the quantization/noise parameters and provide a theoretical bound on the convergence rate.
This theoretical bound is decomposed into two components, including the variance of the global gradient and an upper bound on the quadratic bias that can be minimized by optimizing the communication resources, quantization, and added noise parameters.
The resulting optimization turns out to be a Mixed-Integer Non-linear Programming (MINLP) problem.
To tackle it, we first transform this MINLP problem into a new problem whose solutions are proved to be the optimal solutions of the original one.
We then propose an approximate algorithm to solve the transformed problem with an arbitrary relative error guarantee.
Extensive simulations show that under the same wireless resource constraints and differential privacy protection requirements, the proposed approximate algorithm achieves an accuracy close to the accuracy of the conventional FL without quantization and no added noise.
The results can achieve a higher convergence rate while preserving users’ privacy.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The rapid growth of mobile devices and services resulted in a huge amount of data for artificial intelligence (AI) based mobile applications, e.g., healthcare and e-commerce services.
However, constructing a global model from big data is still challenging.
First, due to privacy concerns, mobile users are not always willing to share their raw data (e.g., location, information, and travel habits/data).
Second, fusing users’ data at a server may incur significant communication overhead/cost.
In this context, Federated Learning (FL), among various distributed learning frameworks, has recently emerged as a potential solution to address these two challenges.
Specifically, instead of requiring mobile users to share their raw data, FL only requires users to send their gradients based on their local data to a centralized server for the learning process.
By doing so, not only the communication cost significantly decreases but also users’ privacy concerns are alleviated <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, FL faces different challenges when deployed over wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
First, although only local gradients from mobile users are sent to the server, the communication cost remains a major concern for the FL over wireless networks (FLoWNs).
The reason is that a mobile AI-based application may require updates/data from a large number of devices (in the order of thousands or more), thus putting significant stress on network resources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
Additionally, to achieve a certain accuracy level, multiple rounds of information exchange between the participating devices and the aggregating server are required.
These problems are particularly more pronounced with complex deep learning models in which a local update may contain millions of parameters <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
Second, due to its broadcast/open nature, wireless networks are vulnerable to many types of attacks, such as Man-in-the-Middle, DDoS, and Sybil, leading to privacy concerns <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
Recent studies (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>) revealed that it is possible to retrieve the original data from the victims’ shared local gradients.
This can void the privacy protection advantage of FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To address the above challenges, a few works have adopted a quantization technique to reduce communication costs. For example, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, the gradient elements are rounded to either 1 or -1.
The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> presented another quantized FL framework that periodically averages the model’s parameters at the server’s side and quantizes the message-passing from edge nodes to the server.
Furthermore, to improve the performance of FL (e.g., convergence rate), each node updates its local model by applying stochastic gradient descent (SGD) after a fixed number of iterations.
Finally, to better scale the system, the server only updates the model with a fraction of the total nodes in each round.
Similarly, the study in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> proposed an FL with quantization constraint on the gradients.
To establish a theoretical guarantee, the authors showed that the error caused by the quantization scheme is bounded by a term that decreases exponentially with the number of users.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed algorithms with periodic quantization and analyzed their convergence properties.
In particular, they derived an upper bound on the learning time of various objective functions, including strongly convex and non-convex ones.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed a heterogeneous quantization approach that allows users to adapt the quantization parameters according to their communication resources.
The network was partitioned into groups, and the local model user updates were divided into segments and aggregated the updates on segments.
The authors demonstrated that their framework guarantees secure aggregation simultaneously in Byzantine scenarios and achieves convergence in non-Byzantine scenarios.
Unlike the above works, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> proposed a strategy to adjust the quantization levels during the training process.
Through simulations on deep neural networks, they showed that their method achieves fewer communicated bits compared to a fixed quantization level policy.
Interested readers are referred to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> for a comprehensive survey on model quantization for deep neural networks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To address privacy concerns in FL, there is a rising interest in Differential Privacy (DP), which is a scheme to share group pattern information of a dataset while securing the privacy of individuals.
It uses a privacy budget parameter to measure the distinguishing probability between two datasets that differ by one individual record.
The idea of DP is to add noise to private records in the dataset before aggregation.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, the authors proved that by adjusting the artificial noise, any privacy protection level can be satisfied.
They also analyzed the optimal number of devices to maximize the convergence rate of the underlying learning process.
This theoretical analysis also captures the trade-off between the privacy level and the convergence rate as well as the impact of the number of devices.
To preserve user privacy and reduce the communication cost, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> integrated FL with two-bit quantization and local DP mechanisms over an Internet of Vehicles network.
The local DP mechanisms include a three-output mechanism for a small privacy budget, an optimal piecewise mechanism (PM-OPT), a suboptimal mechanism (PM-SUB), and a hybrid combining of PM-OPT and PM-SUB mechanism for a large privacy budget. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, the authors considered a Gaussian mechanism for adding noise to the gradients of FL.
Compared to other works, this work achieves a tighter bound on the privacy budget.
The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> studied the communication efficiency, privacy, and convergence trade-offs between the federated communication cost and local DP SDG algorithm.
In particular, the proposed algorithm applied for the empirical risk minimization (ERM) optimization problem while guaranteeing the communication efficiency and privacy restrictions applied for the FL network.
The authors leveraged the advantages of client subsampling and data subsampling as well as the shuffled model of privacy to deal with the limitation of DP.
Theoretically, the proposed algorithm provides a lower bound on the ERM problem.
Readers are referred to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> for a more comprehensive survey of DP in FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Note that all aforementioned works do not take into account optimization of the system parameters (e.g., transmit power, bandwidth, and transmission time) and the quantization/noise factors while guaranteeing the DP of users in the underlying FL process.
This problem is, in fact, very challenging since privacy-preserving methods often add noise to data or use quantization, hence significantly reducing the learning quality.
For example, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> proposed a framework that leverages quantization and Binomial mechanisms to reduce communication costs and provide DP.
However, they only focused on the theoretical side and did not study the inherent factors of an FL system over wireless networks, e.g., limited bandwidth, transmit power, and transmission time.
Moreover, the optimization of wireless/communication resources is often done on a short-term basis (e.g., at a packet of a frame length) while the learning convergence rate/accuracy must be optimized over a much longer time scale.
Studying the impact of these system parameters on the performance of FLoWNs with regard to DP protection, learning accuracy, and convergence rate is the focus of this article. Our major contributions are as follows:</p>

This is inline with the idea recently reported in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> where the privacy budget can be treated as a type of resource.</p>

Later, it can be seen that the bandwidth, the transmission time, and the transmit power only appear on the right-hand side of a constraint which is a function that monotonically increases with respect to these parameters.
Thus, we can fix two among three parameters, i.e., the bandwidth, the transmission time, and the transmit power, to optimize the other parameter.</p>

It is worth noting that here we assume homogeneous users/devices where the same quantization parameters are applied to gradients of all users and all rounds. In practice, one can also use adaptive gradient quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> to leverage the heterogeneity of users/devices or even the change in each updating round/iteration.</p>

We then select the solution with the smallest objective value of each group.
As shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ IV-C Convergence rate analysis ‣ IV Experiment results ‣ Optimal Privacy Preserving for Federated Learning in Mobile Edge Computing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, even though the quantization and Binomial mechanism introduce noise to data, our proposed solution still achieves an accuracy that is close to that of the conventional FL after <math id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="2500" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1a"><mn id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml">2500</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1">2500</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1c">2500</annotation></semantics></math> global update rounds.
We also observe that the accuracy curve of Sol. 1 gets close to the accuracy curve of our proposed solution.
The reason is that the objective value of Sol. 1 is the second smallest and is close to the objective value of our proposed solution.
Thus, it demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in optimizing the system parameters, i.e., transmit power and the quantization/noise parameters for the SLQBM-FL.</p>

In particular, the number of training rounds counts the number of global update rounds until the accuracy achieves 88%.
The reason behind the value 88% is that this value is the accuracy threshold of the most feasible solutions in empirical.
The communication costs of the proposed Algorithm <a href="#alg2" title="Algorithm 2 ‣ III-B Approximate Algorithm ‣ III Problem formulation and solutions ‣ Optimal Privacy Preserving for Federated Learning in Mobile Edge Computing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> and four baseline approaches are presented in a bar chart in Fig. <a href="#S4.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ IV-D System efficiency ‣ IV Experiment results ‣ Optimal Privacy Preserving for Federated Learning in Mobile Edge Computing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>.
The result of <span id="S4.SS4.p2.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Sol. 3</span> is not presented here as its accuracy cannot achieve the threshold of 88%.
It is clear that the proposed algorithm solution’s communication cost is close to conventional FL and significantly lower than those of the other feasible solutions.
In addition, the communication cost of the proposed algorithm is also lower than that of the FL with no quantization but with added noise, showing the effectiveness of the quantization mechanism.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we first derived a tighter than the state-of-the-art differential privacy budget estimation for Federated learning over mobile edge networks with quantized gradients and added noise (to protect mobile users’ privacy).
By analyzing the relationship between the convergence rate and the system parameters, i.e., the transmit power, the bandwidth, the transmission time, and the quantization/noise parameters, we provided a theoretical bound on the convergence rate.
This bound was decomposed into two components, including the variance of the global gradient and the quadratic bias introduced by the quantization/noise mechanism.
We then analyzed the theoretical and practical reasons to improve the convergence rate by optimizing the upper bound of the quadratic bias.
We then jointly optimized the level of quantization, the Binomial mechanism’s parameters, and the transmit power.
The resulting problem is an MINLP.
To tackle it, we transformed the problem into the new one whose optimal solutions are proved to be optimal solutions of the original one. We then designed an effective algorithm that can approximately solve the new problem with an arbitrary relative error.
Extensive simulations showed with mostly the same wireless resources the proposed approach achieves an accuracy that is close to that of the conventional FL without quantization and without added noise while achieving the required DP protection. This suggested the faster convergence rate of the proposed wireless FL framework while optimally preserving users’ privacy.</p>
