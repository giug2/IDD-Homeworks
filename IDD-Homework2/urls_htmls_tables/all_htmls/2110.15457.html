<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Many researchers have proposed replacing the aggregation server in federated learning with a blockchain system to improve privacy, robustness, and scalability. In this approach, clients would upload their updated models to the blockchain ledger and use a smart contract to perform model averaging. However, the significant delay and limited computational capabilities of blockchain systems make it inefficient to support machine learning applications on the blockchain.</p>
<p id="id2.id2" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a new public blockchain architecture called DFL, which is specially optimized for distributed federated machine learning. Our architecture inherits the merits of traditional blockchain systems while achieving low latency and low resource consumption by waiving global consensus. To evaluate the performance and robustness of our architecture, we implemented a prototype and tested it on a physical four-node network, and also developed a simulator to simulate larger networks and more complex situations. Our experiments show that the DFL architecture can reach over 90% accuracy for non-I.I.D. datasets, even in the presence of model poisoning attacks, while ensuring that the blockchain part consumes less than 5% of hardware resources.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the past ten years, people have witnessed the rise of crypto-currency and the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi). Most current blockchain applications are limited to the financial domain because it is non-sensitive to performance limitations but relies on data security and integrity. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx12" title="" class="ltx_ref">Hou et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>(2021)</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx20" title="" class="ltx_ref">Li et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>(2022a)</a>]</cite> show some potential blockchain application areas such as Internet of Things(IoT) and health care. However, only limited practical applications exist in these areas due to the low transaction per second (TPS) and high latency of blockchain systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is a machine learning (ML) training method where multiple clients send their local model updates to a central server, which will later generate a new global model and broadcast it to clients. Federated learning addresses privacy issues by keeping the training data on clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx44" title="" class="ltx_ref">Zwaard et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>(2020)</a>]</cite>, but it raises trust challenges between clients and central servers. For example, clients can send incorrect models to the central server to harm the global model. Servers can also infer the training data on a specific client using the changes in its model, causing privacy leakage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx3" title="" class="ltx_ref">Bhowmick et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>(2018)</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx7" title="" class="ltx_ref">Enthoven and Al-Ars(2021a)</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To address the above challenges, some researchers suggest utilizing blockchain technology as a replacement for central servers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx2" title="" class="ltx_ref">Bao et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>(2019)</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx6" title="" class="ltx_ref">Desai et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>(2020)</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx26" title="" class="ltx_ref">Majeed and Hong(2019)</a>]</cite>. This is possible because blockchain offers a transparent and honest environment for generating and broadcasting the new global model. Blockchain also offers a reliable record of the models submitted by clients, thus malicious clients can be identified and removed. Mainstream research in federated learning on blockchain uses smart contracts to perform model aggregation, which results in poor performance because generating a block usually costs over 10 seconds <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx18" title="" class="ltx_ref">Korkmaz et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>(2020)</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx32" title="" class="ltx_ref">Ramanan and Nakayama(2020)</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposes a new blockchain architecture turning the blockchain database from a distributed ledger into a distributed proof of contribution to the ML model, where each node can generate its own blocks asynchronously, significantly improving the overall federated learning efficiency. The new architecture also shows reasonable stability and robustness, with a suitable node reputation strategy and weighted FedAvg implementation for non-I.I.D. datasets and model poising attacks.
From the ML perspective, the main contribution of this paper is an asynchronous Gossip-alike ML training method with blockchain that stores proof of contribution to the ML models. We implement this method in the DFL framework, including an executable prototype, a simulator to simulate the ML behavior, and an SDK to design reputation/model updating algorithms. This paper also mentions other algorithms, such as the reputation algorithm and weighted federated averaging algorithm, but they are not the main contributions because they are used to study the characteristics of the DFL framework.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Blockchain systems were first introduced in bitcoin <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx29" title="" class="ltx_ref">Nakamoto(2009)</a>]</cite>, a peer-to-peer, public and immutable ledger system. All transactions in bitcoin are sealed into blocks to achieve immutability. These blocks are then stored in a directed chain where each block contains the digest of the previous block. The directed chain ensures that any changes in a block will result in the change of all following blocks. Additionally, a global consensus algorithm is applied to ensure that only one chain exists through all nodes in this peer-to-peer network. Bitcoin uses proof of work (PoW) to reach the global consensus, where bitcoin miners must ”dig” for a random number to make the block digest meet a certain pattern. The difficulty of finding such a random number varies with the computation power in the whole blockchain network - it becomes more difficult to find a qualified random number with more computational power in total.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In a blockchain system, the computation power of the network is measured by the speed of generating blocks, or equivalently, the interval between two adjacent blocks. This interval time is important for the blockchain system as it determines the probabilities of bifurcation. The term bifurcation describes a situation where in a blockchain network, two nodes generate two correct blocks simultaneously. Since each node only accepts the first block received, one of the blocks would be rejected by over half of all miners. All miners will try to generate the next block based on their current received block. In bifurcation, one block is more likely to generate the next block once it is accepted by most miners because more miners mean more computation resources to find the next block. So as time goes by, one chain will be much longer than the other chains and be accepted by all miners, where the global consensus is reached again. The bifurcation can significantly degrade the performance of the blockchain system and should be avoided. One standard solution is increasing the mining difficulty, which leads to a longer block generation interval. Meanwhile, a longer interval also brings higher latency. However, The bifurcation problem exists in blockchain systems no matter the consensus algorithms.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated ML continues to draw increasing attention from the research community. A typical federated ML system contains a central server and many clients. The central server is responsible for aggregating and updating the models trained by clients, which are then sent back to clients for the next training iterations. This method of aggregating and updating the central model is called FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx27" title="" class="ltx_ref">McMahan et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>(2017)</a>]</cite>.

The next-generation blockchain systems, such as Ethereum <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx39" title="" class="ltx_ref">Wood(2014)</a>]</cite>, provide smart contracts to allow users to execute specific small applications on the blockchain system. The smart contract is more reliable because its source code is open to the public on the blockchain and all miners will execute it to ensure the integrity of the results. Some researchers hence attempt to integrate federated ML with Ethereum and replace the model aggregating server with smart contracts <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx18" title="" class="ltx_ref">Korkmaz et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>(2020)</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx32" title="" class="ltx_ref">Ramanan and Nakayama(2020)</a>]</cite>.

DFL implements partial consensus which is more effective in this case, because partial consensus allows each node to do model averaging when they receive models rather than waiting for a block to be finalized.

<div id="S3.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Gossip algorithms have been a popular choice for decentralized federated learning research, as they enable the sharing of models in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx13" title="" class="ltx_ref">Hu et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>(2019)</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx17" title="" class="ltx_ref">Koloskova et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>(2019)</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx33" title="" class="ltx_ref">Roy et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>(2019)</a>]</cite>. DFL also utilizes a gossip mechanism, in which each node only shares its models with a limited number of neighbors and invites them to be witnesses of its contribution to the ML models. While gossip algorithms offer a decentralized approach to model sharing, they may not provide the same level of transparency and trust as a blockchain-based system because single node doesn’t obtain the information of the whole network.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">From a blockchain perspective, the gossip mechanism used in DFL is called ”partial consensus”, as the ML model (transaction) is only broadcast to a limited range of nodes, rather than the entire blockchain network as in global consensus. Partial consensus is suitable for ML applications for two main reasons. Firstly, the order in which transactions arrive is not critical, as a transaction that arrives late can still be used in the current averaging round. Secondly, the model weights contained in the transactions are not critical. Two models with the same accuracy, as determined by the same test dataset, may have different model weights.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">As mentioned in Section <a href="#S2.SS1" title="II-A Blockchain system and bifurcation ‣ II Related work and background ‣ DFL: High-Performance Blockchain-Based Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">II-A</span></span></a>, global consensus in blockchain systems can lead to bifurcation, and many contemporary blockchain systems increase the block interval to avoid this issue. In contrast, the partial consensus in DFL relaxes the strict synchronization requirement and thus allows for improved model communication efficiency and reduced training time. The role of blockchain databases also shifts from an information-sharing system to proof of contribution for the ML models.
Each node generates and maintains its own blockchain database, which records feedback from its neighbors (i.e., witnesses). However, partial consensus can also introduce new vulnerabilities, such as the potential for malicious behaviors like model poisoning to go unnoticed in the network. To address these concerns, a reputation system will be introduced in the next section to incentivize honest participation and mitigate the risk of malicious behavior.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S3.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There are already some existing reputation systems in the federated ML area. For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx15" title="" class="ltx_ref">Kang et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>(2019)</a>]</cite> proposed using reputation as an incentive mechanism. The reputation system in DFL is responsible for distinguishing the malicious node in partial consensus. A malicious node can be a node frequently broadcasting low-accuracy models, or performing a data poisoning attack, or performing a model poisoning attack. The reputation is distributed and different nodes may rate the same node independently. For example, considering a three-node system - the reputation of node C in node A might be different from that stored in node B.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The reputation can be updated according to any rational ML model criterion. In this paper, we mainly consider updating the reputation according to the model’s accuracy. More specifically, each node will have its own local reputation record of its neighbors and will update the reputation record based on the accuracy of neighbors’ models calculated by itself based on its local dataset. Broadcasting models with higher accuracy earn the node a higher reputation in the system. The reputation will be stored locally and not shared with other nodes.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To protect the system, a malicious node should have a lower reputation in the reputation system. Meanwhile, the influence of malicious models should be lowered as well. We propose using the weighted federated averaging method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx40" title="" class="ltx_ref">Wu and Wang(2021)</a>]</cite>, a modified version of FedAvg, in this paper. The modified FedAvg mechanism works together with the reputation system to keep the federated ML secured and stable.</p>

However, there are many other factors that can affect the implementation of this system, such as the malicious rate, training performance, and data distribution. In future work, we plan to investigate the impact of these factors on the reputation and weighted FedAvg system and develop more universal implementations that can handle a wide range of variations.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">One potential application is replacing current blockchain-based federated ML systems for less training time and lower resource consumption. Meanwhile, the blockchain database can serve as an incentive mechanism and allow further reward distribution, avoiding the miner fee issue in traditional blockchain-based federated ML systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Another possible application is allowing independent developers to deploy their ML models without running expensive cloud servers or paying miner fees. For example, they can embed DFL in their apps to collect data and train models. The reward can be replaced with in-app benefits to compensate users for hardware resources.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS3.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">DFL also makes it possible to build community-driven ML ecosystems, in which developers can propose ML models that are trained using data contributed by users and advertise them to attract miners to collaborate on the training process. Smart contracts on traditional blockchain systems can be used to receive DFL blockchain data and distribute token rewards to miners as an incentive for their participation. These tokens can then be used for ML inference in the future if the model is adequately trained, and people can buy the tokens from miners to pay the inference fee. As a result, ML models that are more useful and have higher accuracy are expected to have higher token values on the traditional blockchain, reflecting their perceived value in the ecosystem.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">There are several projects that are similar to DFL but are not based on blockchain technology. For example, IPLS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx30" title="" class="ltx_ref">Pappas et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>(2021)</a>]</cite> is a decentralized federated learning system that uses the inter-planetary file system (IPFS) for model dissemination. In terms of federated learning, IPLS applies the segmented model to save bandwidth, which is also different from DFL. Another project, BrainTorrent <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx33" title="" class="ltx_ref">Roy et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>(2019)</a>]</cite>, is a peer-to-peer federated learning system that is similar to DFL in terms of the federated learning process. However, BrainTorrent requires nodes to actively choose their peers and collect models, whereas DFL uses a broadcast mechanism for model dissemination. Overall, these projects demonstrate that there are alternative approaches to federated learning that can be implemented without the use of blockchain technology.</p>

The workflow consists of two event-driven phases. The left phase is triggered when the node has collected enough ”ML training data” for training (e.g. when the training data size becomes equal to/larger than the ML batch size). The node will create a ”transaction” that includes the new ”ML model”, and broadcast it to other nodes. After several rounds of communications, the node can generate the ”blockchain (proof of contribution)”. The right phase is triggered when the node has received enough transactions (controlled by ”model buffer” size) from other nodes to update the ML model and ends by updating the ”(new) ML model” and ”reputation system”.</p>

<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The blockchain data serves as proof of contribution and can be submitted to a dedicated reward calculation system to quantify the contributions to ML models and distribute the rewards to the DFL nodes.

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Suppose in our DFL system, node 1 is training at the beginning. The model weights after training are sent to the neighbors of node 1, i.e. nodes 2, 3, and 4 since the network is fully connected. Once other nodes receive the weights, they will start to measure the model accuracy based on their own collected dataset. Each receiver will generate a receipt describing the accuracy of the model, which is then appended at the end of the transaction. The transaction, together with the receipt, will be sent from each receiver to all its neighbors. For instance, node 2 as receiver of model weights from node 1, will send the transaction and receipt to, not only node 1 but also nodes 3 and 4 as well. However, nodes 3 and 4 will ignore the transaction and receipt from node 2, as this transaction has been processed beforehand. Node 1 will collect the receipt for generating the block afterward.</p>

Node 1 sends a draft block to node 2, then node 2 will look through the receipts to figure out whether some receipts are produced by node 2 and generate confirmations if there are any. Node 1 will gather all confirmations from nodes 2, 3, and 4 and append the confirmations to finalize the block. The digest of the final block will then be used to generate the next block.</p>

In DFL, all nodes will not shuffle their dataset, so a model can have different accuracy for different nodes, especially for non-I.I.D. dataset. The accuracy will be forwarded back to the transaction creator and other nodes. This accuracy information might be helpful for other nodes because it assists to judge the receipt creator’s reputation, but it has not yet been implemented in the current DFL version.</p>

<div id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One of the key features of DFL is its ability to operate asynchronously, as it does not rely on global consensus. This means that the generating transaction, block, receipt, and confirmation processes on different nodes can be performed independently of each other. Additionally, the ML process and the generating blockchain process can also be asynchronous, as long as it is not necessary to record the contribution in the current or next block. This asynchronous nature of DFL allows nodes to operate independently, which can enhance the scalability and efficiency of the system.</p>

<div id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">All nodes are anonymous on the DFL network, as their IP addresses are hidden behind their node addresses and their data packets are only available to their direct peers. While this anonymity provides some level of protection for nodes, it is important to note that the node address itself may serve as an identifier for an attacker who wants to recover the dataset held by a victim. There are already several blockchain projects, such as Monero <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx28" title="" class="ltx_ref">monero project(2022)</a>]</cite>, that aim to enhance node anonymity.

<p id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In DFL, blocks become immutable once they are finalized. This is because neighbors will not generate block confirmations for a receipt more than once, and the block generator cannot modify any content in the receipts or confirmations, as they are protected by the signatures of other nodes. The immutability of blocks in DFL helps to ensure that the contribution to the ML models cannot be modified. This is important for maintaining the integrity of the system and ensuring that all nodes are properly incentivized for their participation.</p>

The ML models in the blockchain data can also be deleted before submitting to the rewarding system if the rewarding algorithm does not require the ML models.</p>

<p id="S4.I1.i5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As for network failures, failure to broadcast transactions can cause some transactions to be missed, resulting in fewer contributions to the network and fewer blocks. Failure to send draft blocks results in fewer blockchain confirmations. In practical DFL deployment, each node only needs to collect a certain percentage of confirmations in order to finalize a block. Disconnected nodes can catch up with the rest of the network after re-connection by using a model updating mechanism that gives higher weights to more accurate machine learning models.</p>

<p id="S4.I1.i6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">An attack method to fake contributions is possible in DFL. This attack method can be described as an attacker that steals the model from other legitimate nodes and generates a new transaction that includes the copied model to gain contributions. Verifying the digest of a transaction does not help because the attacker can slightly modify the model weights to get a completely different digest while retaining similar accuracy. There are two potential ways to defend against this attack. One is to use Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx36" title="" class="ltx_ref">Wang et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>(2020)</a>]</cite> on all nodes to protect the model data. The other way is to use homomorphic encryption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx25" title="" class="ltx_ref">Mahmood and Ibrahem(2018)</a>]</cite> to encrypt the model, which allows other nodes to use the model without decrypting it.</p>

We also upload the simulation configuration files and reputation binary files to make the simulation results re-producible.
The ML model used in our experiment and simulations is LeNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx19" title="" class="ltx_ref">Lecun et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>(1998)</a>]</cite>, and the dataset is MNIST <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx5" title="" class="ltx_ref">Deng(2012)</a>]</cite>. We use the same hyperparameters as the LeNet example in Caffe <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx10" title="" class="ltx_ref">Github(2022)</a>]</cite> because improving the ML models is not our focus. We implement two types of reputation and weighted FedAvg methods. The first implementation is a slightly modified version of federated averaging without reputation. The following formula describes the model updating procedure on each node:</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The goal of this experiment is to investigate the performance of the DFL network. The built-in performance profiler in the DFL executable can measure the CPU time consumed by each task in the DFL components (generate block, generate transactions, update models and receive transactions). The GPU acceleration in Caffe is disabled to ensure the metric of CPU time is fair for ML and blockchain tasks.
We provide two DFL testnets, a four-node net, and a two-node net. Both testnets use the ”<span id="S5.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">reputation-0.05</span>” mechanism.</p>

<div id="S5.SS1.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The two-node test net is configured as each node will receive eight randomly-selected data samples from the MNIST training dataset per second. The training batch size is 64, so each node will perform a training every 8 seconds in theory. A transaction will be generated and broadcast immediately after the training. Each node will generate a block after broadcasting 4 transactions, equivalent to 32 seconds. The test batch size is 100, and each node will randomly choose 100 samples from all received samples. We do not use the test dataset here because choosing from received samples is closer to practical cases. On a higher level, other DFL nodes with different received samples can replace the role of the test dataset. The FedAvg buffer size is set to 4, causing the FedAvg and reputation mechanism to run roughly every 32 seconds.</p>

The accuracy is tested based on local received data on each node. It causes a rapid increase (from 0s to 30s) in accuracy at the beginning of training. The rapid drop near 32 second is caused by the FedAvg process, which merges the models from other nodes with different datasets.

The performance result indicates that the blockchain part (blockchain overhead) only consumes a small portion of CPU time, the network (broadcast transaction, gather confirmation and broadcast generated transaction) consumes much more, and ML (calculate accuracy, calculate self-accuracy and measure accuracy) costs the most. In DFL, the blockchain data is proof of contribution to ML models, and spending less time generating such proof is always desirable.</p>

The real value is slightly smaller because some confirmations are not collected in time. In practical deployment, the rule of finalizing a block could be ”collecting at least 80 percent of all confirmations” or ”collecting at least 60 percent of confirmations for each transaction” to make trade-offs on the blockchain robustness and performance.</p>

Given that the number of neighbors is restricted to a specific maximum and that the workflow on each node is asynchronous from that of other nodes, DFL does not suffer from blockchain-related scalability issues as the number of nodes in the network increases.</p>

It is important to note here that the blockchain performance in Baffle is affected by the ”chunk size” parameter (which is not an issue for DFL). Additionally, the reason why we do not use wall-clock time for DFL in Table <a href="#S5.T8" title="TABLE VIII ‣ V-A2 The four-node net ‣ V-A DFL performance (experiment) ‣ V Result and discussion ‣ DFL: High-Performance Blockchain-Based Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VIII</span></a> is that it is determined by the manually-set training data injection rate.</p>

For the other two types of non-IID samples, we sampled a probability distribution over the class labels for each node based on a symmetric Dirichlet prior.

<p id="S5.I2.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There is only one model in traditional ML systems and federated ML systems, indicating the model weight difference should be zero when a model is sufficiently trained. However, the model weight difference in DFL does not converge to zero but rather converges to a constant value when the model is properly trained. Subplots 8,9,10,11 also show unsuccessful training has lower model weight difference than successful training. In addition, the model weight difference does not constantly decrease during the training process. The weight difference at 4000 tick is even higher than 600 tick in Subplot 0. In other words, the training result of the DFL network is a set of models rather than a single model, and each model has similar accuracy. One of the potential applications of this property is training models whose dataset relates to geographical location. For example, a disease in different continents has different disease behavior, and there are two DFL nodes on each continent. Both DFL nodes should be able to train a model that can best predict the disease based on different disease behavior. For traditional ML systems, the geographical information must be included in the training dataset, but we would not know that geographical information is critical to the model if we do not aggregate all the data.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper presents a new asynchronous federated learning system, integrating a specialized blockchain system to generate the proof of contribution on the ML model. Using blockchain as a distributed proof system rather than a distributed ledger system removes the synchronicity requirement to increase performance. Meanwhile the asynchronicity also introduces the partial aggregation of models in training phase. We implement the architecture as DFL, which contains an executable prototype, a simulator to investigate ML behavior and an SDK to implement and test reputation algorithms. In a four node experiment with MNIST and LeNet, the training accuracy can be up to 90% while the blockchain overhead can be kept limited to within only 5% of total execution time. The simulation results show reasonable training accuracy under both non-I.I.D. datasets as well as malicious dataset attacks. However, the reputation mechanism only works in certain model attack cases and requires further research.</p>
