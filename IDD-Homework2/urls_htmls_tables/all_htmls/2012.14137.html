<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">As an emerging technique, mobile edge computing (MEC) introduces a new scheme for various distributed communication-computing systems such as industrial Internet of Things (IoT), vehicular communication, smart city, etc. In this work, we mainly focus on the timeliness of the MEC systems where the freshness of the data and computation tasks is significant. Firstly, we formulate a kind of age-sensitive MEC models and define the average age of information (AoI) minimization problems of interests. Then, a novel mixed-policy based multimodal deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework, called heterogeneous multi-agent actor-critic (H-MAAC), is proposed as a paradigm for joint collaboration in the investigated MEC systems, where edge devices and center controller learn the interactive strategies through their own observations. To improve the system performance, we develop the corresponding online algorithm by introducing the edge federated learning mode into the multi-agent cooperation whose advantages on learning convergence can be guaranteed theoretically. To the best of our knowledge, it’s the first joint MEC collaboration algorithm that combines the edge federated mode with the multi-agent actor-critic reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we evaluate the proposed approach and compare it with popular RL based methods. As a result, the proposed algorithm not only outperforms the baselines on average system age, but also promotes the stability of training process. Besides, the simulation outcomes provide several insights for collaboration designs over MEC systems.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the past decades, the number of smart devices has been massively deployed in numerous fields such as industrial IoT, nets of vehicles, environment monitoring networks. As an emerging paradigm for such distributed data systems, edge computing (EC), especially mobile edge computing (MEC), couples the communication with the computation and expands the cloud computing (CC) through allowing the computation to be executed at the edge nodes deployed along the path from data sources to the center cloud. In real applications, an MEC system is composed of three layers. The bottom level contains the sources of the data such as users’ equipments (UEs), sensors or web cameras that generate the data in order to provide certain services. At the middle layers, the edge devices can be smartphones, smart routers, intelligent base stations and vehicles with processors on board, which play a relay role. Edge devices can collect data from edge sensors, assist to execute some computation tasks and then relay them to cloud center <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. At the top level, the data and the service requirements, refer to tasks, are assembled at the cloud center. The edge processing schemes need to be designed, so as to improve the system efficiency as well as flexibility <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. That is, it can efficiently utilize the edge computation capabilities to reduce the redundant communication consumption of the networks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, benefiting from the development of 5G networks, more data can be transmitted with lower latency, which make it possible for MEC systems to be applied in several promising real-time applications. For instance, MEC can support the augment reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and to enhance the user’s experience and promote the quality of the media streaming. In such cases, the images or videos are transmitted and processed in the network and the demands for the data rate and timeliness become stricter than the conventional distributed scenes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Besides, in some urban security scenes such as urgency monitoring, the delay of the data transmission and the processing directly impacts the quality of service <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. To stress out such time-sensitive scenarios, age of information (AoI) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> has been introduced to the related investigations as a metric of data freshness.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Generally, the computing resources and capacities of the mobile edge devices are limited. Additionally, the arrival of data as well as the computation tasks are dynamic, and the communication rates between the entities are also constrained by restricted bandwidth. Thus, the scheduling of the MEC systems should be well-designed. To some degree, such a problem is usually cast into a joint stochastic optimization problem with the certain targets. In particular, considering the strategies for the entity operation in the MEC networks, the MEC collaboration shall be fully studied <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. The collaborations are mainly considered from the following three aspects: 1) The resource management, including computation resources, power and bandwidth allocation, etc. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>; 2) The edge-level control, i.e., the data collection and trajectory planning for mobile edge devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>; 3) The data scheduling, including the task execution at the edge devices, the computation assignment for the edge network and the data offloading to the cloud center <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. The critical point of the joint collaboration is to achieve the global optimal strategies for MEC systems. Unfortunately, due to the dynamics of the MEC environment and the complex coupling of the entities from different layers, the related optimization problems are always non-convex and NP-hard <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Therefore, the conventional vanilla optimization methods may not work well for the joint MEC collaboration problems and the iterated online approaches with better learning ability and intelligence shall be investigated.</p>

<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Further, for future 6G networks, edge-native artificial intelligence (AI) is regarded to be a potential subject which leverages the MEC systems together with the distributed computing applications. The concepts of <span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">AI for EC</span> and <span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">EC for AI</span> are promising visions for future data systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. In this article, we mainly focus on <span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">AI for EC</span> and consider how to exploit AI or deep learning (DL) techniques to improve the performance of edge computing systems. Reinforcement learning (RL), especially deep reinforcement learning (DRL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> has been incorporated into several decision-making scenarios such as automatic robot control and game playing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. A widely used class of reinforcement learning approaches are value based RL, e.g. Q-learning and deep Q-network (DQN) which predict the system targets of each action and the make decisions according to an action-value function <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. For the continuous control or the cases where the action space is extremely large, policy based methods such as DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) are introduced <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. The basic notion is that an actor module and a critic module are built to fit the best strategies and the evaluation values respectively. Moreover, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> and federated learning (FL) based reinforcement learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> are also developed for the distributed scenes where agents learn to make decisions through their local observations and cooperate for the same system targets.</p>

<div id="S1.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Motivated by these, we consider a multi-agent reinforcement learning approach for joint MEC collaboration to maintain the data freshness. In particular, we investigate the cooperative learning framework with mixed policies where the agents learn multiple strategies through local observations and states. Besides, the communication mechanism among learning agents is also a critical point to be studied in this article.</p>

<div id="S1.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">A number of researches exploited the multi-stage optimization method or iterative algorithms to solve the joint collaboration problems. However, these existing approaches suffered from the challenges that the real-world scenes are dynamics and complicated, which makes it difficult for these algorithms to extract the latent connections between the environment variation and the entity operation. Hence, some reinforcement learning based online algorithms are developed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> for MEC data systems. The Q-learning and DQN based RL methods were applied for resource allocation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, task offloading <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, as well as trajectory planning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>.

Additionally, taking the multiple edge devices into consideration, some extended versions of multi-agent reinforcement learning methods were proposed. A multi-agent actor-critic based offloading approach was designed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>.

In this work, we investigate the cases where edge devices only share the states, observations and learning parameters which means that neither data nor tasks are transmitted between edge devices. Therefore, the transmission costs of edge-edge communication shall be negligible. The transmission process of source-edge and edge-cloud can be modelled as an air to ground (A2G) channel <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> where line-of-sight (LoS) path loss as well as none-line-of-sight (NLoS) loss shall be considered <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>.</p>

The heterogeneity comes from three aspects: 1) The multi-modality of input states; 2) The multiple output actions; 3) The ensemble neural network models to learn the mixed policies. Overall, dual lightweight neural networks are built for each learning, containing original actor/critic nets and target actor/critic nets. Since the structures of the networks are relatively simple which will cost less computation resources, the framework can be deployed on each edge devices. The details of the framework are as follows.</p>

The other inputs, buffer states and allocated bandwidth are formatted as lists and scalars. And the data scheduling vectors are outputted by an MLP net. For center actor net, its inputs consist of the state lists of the edge devices and the output is a one-sum vector for bandwidth allocation. As for the center agent actor, we use an MLP to combine the multiple edge state lists to allocate bandwidth proportion for edge-center communication, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S3.F3.sf3" title="In Figure 3 ‣ III-B An Edge-Federated Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Actor-Critic Framework ‣ III An Edge Federated Actor-Critic Learning Framework for Multi-Agent Cooperation ‣ Federated Multi-Agent Actor-Critic Learning for Age Sensitive Mobile Edge Computing The work was supported by Beijing Natural Science Foundation No. 4202030.

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS4.p1.2" class="ltx_p">Note that it is a cooperative model and the penalties of edge agents are identical. Commonly speaking, so as to reach the global optimum, the cross-communication is required in such multi-agent learning scenarios to share the knowledge of different agents. However, in the MEC system of interests, the encoding of the multimodal input states is hard to design. What’s more, the transmission and the processing of the observation will cost excessive communication and computation resources. Hence, to overcome these difficulties, inspired by the concept of federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite>, we propose an edge-federated mode for the above framework, where every <math id="S3.SS2.SSS4.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="E_{f}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.SSS4.p1.1.m1.1a"><msub id="S3.SS2.SSS4.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.SSS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS2.SSS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS2.SSS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">E</mi><mi id="S3.SS2.SSS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS2.SSS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">f</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.SSS4.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S3.SS2.SSS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS4.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS2.SSS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS4.p1.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS2.SSS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝐸</ci><ci id="S3.SS2.SSS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑓</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.SSS4.p1.1.m1.1c">E_{f}</annotation></semantics></math> learning epoch, all edge agents share their actor net parameters and carry out the federated updating.

<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We implement EdgeFed H-MAAC collaboration algorithm, by building the CNN-MLPs mixed networks for edge actor-critic nets and MLP based networks as center agent with TensorFlow. To compare the performance of the proposed frameworks with the other RL approaches, we select two actor-critic based algorithms, DDPG (centralized) and the popular MADDPG (multi-agent) as the baselines where dual neural networks are also exploited to learn the mixed policies. For fairness, we set the same random seeds of the MEC environment for all methods and instead of spending much effort on network tuning, we also fix the random seeds of training processes. Consequently, the results are of generality and can be easily reproduced.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We investigated the age sensitive MEC systems and proposed a policy based multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, H-MAAC, for agent intelligent control of the trajectory planning, data scheduling as well as bandwidth allocation. By adopting federated learning mode, we developed the corresponding edge federated online joint collaboration algorithms whose convergence were theoretically proved. We implemented the MEC simulation system and evaluated the proposed algorithms. The outcomes showed that our method has lower average age and better learning stability compared to classical centralized actor-critic RL approaches. Moreover, some other advantages and the inspirations for edge federated design are also discussed according to the simulation results.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For further work, based on the proposed H-MAAC framework, more operations of agents can be expanded such as the power allocation, multitask scheduling and multitask offloading. In addition, the penalty/reward of the system can be flexibly defined which may bring more applications for cooperative MEC systems.</p>
