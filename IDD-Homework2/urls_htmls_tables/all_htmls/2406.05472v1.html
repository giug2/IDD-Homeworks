<p class="ltx_p" id="id6.id1">Cybersecurity breaches in digital substations can pose significant challenges to the stability and reliability of power system operations. To address these challenges, defense and mitigation techniques are required. Identifying and detecting anomalies in information and communication technology (ICT) is crucial to ensure secure device interactions within digital substations. This paper proposes a task-oriented dialogue (ToD) system for anomaly detection (AD) in datasets of multicast messages e.g., generic object oriented substation event (GOOSE) and sampled value (SV) in digital substations using large language models (LLMs).
This model has a lower potential error and better scalability and adaptability than a process that considers the cybersecurity guidelines recommended by humans, known as the human-in-the-loop (HITL) process.
Also, this methodology significantly reduces the effort required when addressing new cyber threats or anomalies compared with machine learning (ML) techniques, since it leaves the model’s complexity and precision unaffected and offers a faster implementation. These findings present a comparative assessment, conducted utilizing standard and advanced performance evaluation metrics for the proposed AD framework and the HITL process. To generate and extract datasets of IEC 61850 communications, a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbed was employed.

<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p1.1">IEC 61850-based digital substations occupy an essential position within the power grid framework by managing the distribution, transformation, and combination of energy flows. The emergence of smart grids has led to the fusion of the power grid infrastructure with communication networks and computational capabilities, introducing a wide array of innovative applications such as automated data collection and the remote control of electrical systems and components <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.05472v1#bib.bib1" title="">1</a>]</cite>. Nonetheless, this combination brings a variety of security vulnerabilities to the smart grid. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are instrumental in detecting malicious activities and curtailing the actions of adversaries. Notably, IDSs have found extensive applications in conventional ICT domains to fulfill this objective. However, adopting IEC 61850 and introducing communication protocols, including GOOSE and SV (i.e., multicast messages), have paved the way for specialized malicious strategies that manifest distinct traffic and attack configurations. These could encompass replay attacks, unauthorized data injection, and denial of service (DoS) attacks. Consequently, there is a pressing need for IDSs to acquire new signatures for purposes of training, testing, validating, and evaluating their efficacy in the face of challenges <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.05472v1#bib.bib2" title="">2</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.05472v1#bib.bib3" title="">3</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p2.1">ML techniques employed in IDSs have become crucial in detecting and addressing anomalies within GOOSE and SV multicast messages. These methodologies are noted for their precision and data-centric approach, offering a sophisticated framework for cybersecurity measures, but they still have challenges. A principal drawback is the necessity for continuous model re-training in response to newly emerging attack vectors. Each time an innovative pattern of attack is identified, an update of the ML models is required to encompass this new information. This re-training process is time-consuming and resource-intensive, creating a temporal window of vulnerability wherein the system remains susceptible to new threats not yet incorporated into the model’s intelligence base <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.05472v1#bib.bib4" title="">4</a>]</cite>. Moreover, the scalability of these IDS-based ML models, their decision-making efficacy, and the efficiency of data processing mechanisms assume critical importance in the operational dynamics of AD. The scalability issue pertains to the model’s ability to adapt and maintain performance levels as the network size or data volume expands. The decision-making process involves the model’s capability to distinguish accurately between secure and malicious activities, a task that becomes increasingly complex with the evolution of sophisticated attack techniques. Lastly, the data processing aspect highlights the need for efficient handling and analysis of vast datasets that systems often rely upon <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.05472v1#bib.bib5" title="">5</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.05472v1#bib.bib6" title="">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p3.1">Considering these points, developing more adaptive, resilient, and scalable AD solutions is imperative. These solutions should minimize the latency in incorporating new threat intelligence and enhance the decision-making processes and data-handling capacities to better manage the complexities associated with GOOSE and SV communications.
Hence, LLMs (e.g., Anthropic Claude Pro <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.05472v1#bib.bib7" title="">7</a>]</cite>, Microsoft Copilot AI <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.05472v1#bib.bib8" title="">8</a>]</cite>) can present a more flexible methodology compared with traditional ML frameworks and an HITL process. Distinctively engineered to understand the details of context, LLMs possess the inherent capability to detect novel attacks/anomalies without the prerequisite of prior training in these scenarios. This adeptness at contextual comprehension significantly reduces the effort and resources typically necessitated by the continual evolution of attacks. Rather than undergoing repetitive cycles of re-training, LLMs are capable of interpreting and adjusting to new data autonomously, thereby offering a more robust and efficient AD method within the context of digital substations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.05472v1#bib.bib9" title="">9</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.05472v1#bib.bib10" title="">10</a>]</cite>. This innovative approach emphasizes the potential of LLMs to enhance cybersecurity by providing a tool that can dynamically evolve in response to cyberattacks.</p>

However, their dataset is not based on the HIL testbed, and different attack scenarios are neglected which makes the efficiency of the approach controversial. An advanced ML technique for real-time AD was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.05472v1#bib.bib17" title="">17</a>]</cite>. It employed feature extraction techniques to optimize the data; however, handling the vast amount of data without compromising the system’s performance is challenging. Moreover, a trade-off between the detection accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness against evolving cyberattack patterns is questionable. A combination of CNN and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks was proposed for enhanced performance in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.05472v1#bib.bib18" title="">18</a>]</cite>. Investigating techniques to improve the robustness and generalization of models to new attack types and evolving cyber threats can be a challenge. Also, feature selection and engineering to identify the most critical features for an AD is arguable. Upadhyay <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S1.SS1.p1.1.2">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.05472v1#bib.bib19" title="">19</a>]</cite> introduced a gradient boosting method for the feature selection in an IDS that demonstrates improved accuracy and reduced false positives (FPs) in detecting anomalies. Nonetheless, they considered a general attack vector for the performance analysis process; hence, there is not sufficient information to distinguish the different types of attacks. A novel IDS was designed to combat manufacturing message specification (MMS)-based measurement attacks that integrated advanced detection algorithms to improve the accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.05472v1#bib.bib12" title="">12</a>]</cite>.

<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.SS2.p1.1">This paper proposes an extended ToD system called CyberGridToD, designed based on LLMs (e.g., Anthropic Claude Pro), that has advantages over HITL processes using LLMs in the area of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and ML algorithms. It is built on historical human recommendation data, enabling it to automate decision-making processes by emulating human decision patterns, potentially leading to a lower error rate over time as it learns from new data. The learning capabilities allow it to be continuously improved. This system can respond quickly due to its automated nature, although this can vary with complexities. It excels in data processing, being capable of handling and analyzing large volumes of data. CyberGridToD is highly scalable and able to serve many users simultaneously without performance degradation. It requires time to build user trust in its recommendations and may struggle with highly complex or situations not covered in its training data. Thus, the main strengths of the proposed framework can be summarized as follows:</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.p1.1">As digital substations integrate advanced communication technologies, they become potential targets for cyberattacks. Ensuring the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure involves implementing multi-layered protective measures, ranging from physical access controls to advanced IDSs. Regular assessments are essential to tackle evolving cyberattacks and attain reliability and stability in power grids <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.05472v1#bib.bib21" title="">21</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.05472v1#bib.bib22" title="">22</a>]</cite>.
A cyber-physical power system testbed is an essential infrastructure for examining in a controlled realistic setting the causal relationships between cyber intrusions and the resilience and reliability of power systems. The real-time HIL testbed integrates various components, including hardware, software, communication protocols, and simulation technologies, all synchronized with the global positioning system (GPS). Such integration is crucial for investigating the real-time dynamics of communications and information processing, which are vital for analyzing cyber intrusions, enhancing detection capabilities, and formulating effective mitigation strategies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.05472v1#bib.bib23" title="">23</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S2.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.p2.1">The architecture of the HIL testbed encompasses a wide range of components, including protective intelligent electronic devices (IEDs), software-defined networking (SDN) switches, GPS, merging unit IED, a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system, a real-time digital simulator, and an amplifier, details of which will be elaborated. The system employs a distributed management system (DMS) SCADA framework for acquiring measurements and executing control commands through DNP3 protocols. Implemented IEDs have the capability to send control signals to circuit breakers (CBs), while a CB (with actuator) is designed to respond to GOOSE messages by transmitting its status (i.e., open or closed) back to the protective IEDs. Additionally, the merging unit IED is tasked with relaying digital current and voltage readings from the digital real-time simulator to the protective IEDs, leveraging the amplifier <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.05472v1#bib.bib10" title="">10</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.05472v1#bib.bib13" title="">13</a>]</cite>. The proposed LLM-based framework is designed to detect anomalies and security threats within the multicast messages, maintaining connectivity with SDN switches to ensure comprehensive protection. The upcoming sections represent the GOOSE and SV datasets from the HIL testbed and their feature extraction process, along with defined anomaly recommendations included in the proposed LLM-based ToD framework.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S3.p1.1">ToD systems are typically assessed based on their proficiency in distinct subtasks, including tracking the dialogue state (known as belief state), managing the dialogue (encompassing action and decision prediction), and generating appropriate responses using an SQL query database. This subdivision of tasks has facilitated the development of specialized models for each sub-task, a methodology that has become prevalent in the field. This research investigates the efficacy of a unified, end-to-end model known as “CyberGridToD” for managing these tasks, as illustrated in Fig. <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.05472v1#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ III A Proposed Large Language Model-based Task-Oriented Dialogue IDS Framework ‣ A Novel Generative AI-Based Framework for Anomaly Detection in Multicast Messages in Smart Grid Communications A.

<p class="ltx_p" id="S3.SS1.p1.1">A comparative analysis of three general AD methods (i.e., HITL, ML models, and the LLM-based ToD method) reveals the superior performance and adaptability of the proposed LLM-based ToD approach. While HITL relies on human operator availability and expertise (which may be limited by operator capabilities and inconsistent decision-making processes) ML models (though faster) are constrained by predefined input/output formats and limited adaptability, requiring retraining on new data or edge cases. In contrast, the proposed LLM-based ToD model offers a more holistic and efficient solution, leveraging natural language dialogue to allow for complex queries and responses, high adaptability to new scenarios and anomalies through the prompt engineering process, and the ability to provide explainable and transparent insights <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.05472v1#bib.bib24" title="">24</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.05472v1#bib.bib25" title="">25</a>]</cite>.

<p class="ltx_p" id="S3.SS1.p2.1">The LLM-based ToD approach demonstrates several key advantages over its counterparts. It enables intuitive and user-friendly natural language interactions, reducing the need for extensive operator training and facilitating rapid adaptation to new scenarios through continual learning and fine-tuning. This adaptability allows the system to handle complex cases and respond effectively to new attacks. Moreover, the proposed framework can process and analyze unstructured text data, making it suitable for handling GOOSE/SV datasets, which may be complex. The system’s scalability and ability to infer and adapt efficiently to new attacks or errors through prompt engineering ensure its robustness in detecting anomalies, overshadowing the capabilities of HITL and ML models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.05472v1#bib.bib26" title="">26</a>]</cite>.</p>

It should be noted that the advanced metrics (i.e., Markedness, Informedness, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)) are employed in this paper to show the consistency, the decision-making process, and the quality of the classifications that are between <math alttext="-1" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" id="S4.p2.1.m1.1"><semantics id="S4.p2.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mo id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1a" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">−</mo><mn id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">1</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.p2.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1"><minus id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1"></minus><cn id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" type="integer" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2">1</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.p2.1.m1.1c">-1</annotation><annotation encoding="application/x-llamapun" id="S4.p2.1.m1.1d">- 1</annotation></semantics></math> and <math alttext="1" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" id="S4.p2.2.m2.1"><semantics id="S4.p2.2.m2.1a"><mn id="S4.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml">1</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.p2.2.m2.1b"><cn id="S4.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" type="integer" xref="S4.p2.2.m2.1.1">1</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.p2.2.m2.1c">1</annotation><annotation encoding="application/x-llamapun" id="S4.p2.2.m2.1d">1</annotation></semantics></math>. These metrics can be useful in the AD process to check the capability and applicability of different LLMs according to the traditional and proposed methods. According to the application of AD in GOOSE/SV datasets, Markedness serves as a valuable metric for assessing the model’s proficiency in mitigating both FPs (e.g., false alarms) and FNs (e.g., missed detection). A Markedness value approaching the upper end of its range signifies a highly dependable AD framework that effectively minimizes erroneous alerts. This characteristic is of paramount importance in ensuring the stability and optimal performance of substations by reducing unnecessary disruptions. Informedness indicates how well the model can detect variations in dataset patterns that signify anomalies. In the case of AD with LLMs, where the occurrence of actual anomalies may be rare, MCC is particularly useful. It ensures that the model’s performance is not overly influenced by the larger class size, providing a true indication of the model’s effectiveness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.05472v1#bib.bib31" title="">31</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.p3.1">The aim of this section is to present the outcomes derived from the evaluation of metrics across various LLMs, categorized according to their respective training levels. The proposed LLM-based ToD framework has been implemented to show the results for evaluation metrics. Also, a comparative analysis of improvements of LLMs based on different training levels is considered for better understanding. Regarding the HITL process, three LLMs, including ChatGPT 4.0, Anthropic Claude Pro, and Google Bard/PaLM 2 (currently Gemini Advanced), have been implemented based on the IDS and human recommendations according to training levels. Then, the proposed framework was tested on two LLMs (Anthropic Claude Pro and Microsoft Copilot AI). The reason for other LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT 4.0, Gemini Advanced) to have not been considered for the proposed framework is that there were internal issues with these LLMs. According to the proposed framework, the interactions between humans and the LLM are based on prompt and response, and that was the target of using an image-based proposed framework to facilitate the process and require less effort. However, ChatGPT 4.0 and Gemini Advanced had issues with continuous errors in analyzing the images and encountered stopped analyses. Also, Gemini Advanced could not analyze the images according to its features (it is a text-based LLM). The next part presents the results and compares between the HITL process and the proposed model based on performance evaluation metrics.</p>

That means the model’s performance in predicting positives and negatives is moderately no better than random guessing, and these models have a high rate of FPs and FNs, affecting the correct predictions. Also, the model’s ability to make informed decisions based on the available SV dataset is not better than flipping a coin. Thus, these values show that these models cannot distinguish between normal and abnormal instances. Hence, these models can be considered unreliable as there is no good correlation between them and the identification of correct predictions.

However, ChatGPT 4.0 has good results, based only on the full training of the HITL process (as bolded in the table), which is very close to the proposed framework by Anthropic LLM. As mentioned before, ChatGPT 4.0 could not handle the proposed framework based on the human interactions and was very slow to handle this task. On the other hand, Anthropic was very user-friendly and manageable to understand and interpret different prompts.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.SS1.p9.1">This diagram depicts all cases, including the HITL and proposed models along with their training levels, for GOOSE and SV datasets, based on the Accuracy metric. The purpose of this figure is to check the incremental percentage at each level. As can be seen, Anthropic has a very small increase according to the proposed framework, which means this model can make a good correlation between different training levels. Also, it can detect anomalies at a very good rate even without any training process, as there is not much difference between assorted levels for both SV and GOOSE datasets. The highest incremental percentage is assigned to the HITL process of Anthropic, which can be more adaptable to learn new recommendations, and next is ChatGPT 4.0. Further, this figure visualizes the accuracy differences in models to check their incremental percentage in comparison with the previous training level.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S4.SS1.p10">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.SS1.p10.1">To recap, the LLM-based ToD framework executed in Anthropic Claude Pro showed the most efficient performance, with high reliability, scalability, and adaptability compared with HITL models and the proposed model carried out by Copilot LLM. ChatGPT 4.0 and Gemini Advanced (formerly Google Bard) did not perform well in implementing the proposed framework because of internal errors, and they stopped analyzing or rejected image uploads, making it hard to interact. According to datasets from the testbed and the proposed framework, it can be deduced that Anthropic Claude Pro currently performs best in the AD process of multicast messages. Also, the LLM-based ToD framework needs minor effort in comparison with ML algorithms because it does not require re-training in cases of new anomalies as LLM-based models have the feature of language processing that make the interpretation and detection more feasible.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.p1.1">This paper proposes for the first time a novel LLM-based ToD framework that can detect anomalies in multicast messages in digital substations in a very efficient and reliable way. A comparison of the LLM-based proposed model with other HITL processes has been carried out to validate its scalability and adaptability mathematically and conceptually in parallel with HITL and ML methods. Also, advanced evaluation metrics are regarded in this paper to check the reliability and correlation ability of the LLM-based models, whereas previous research neglected these metrics in the smart grid domain. Anthropic Claude Pro demonstrates the best general results compared with other HITL processes or Copilot-based ToD frameworks. This innovative framework was implemented in the most famous LLMs, and the proposed methodology showed the best results in almost all metrics, even without any human recommendation at the training level.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.p2.1">In the future, the main goal will be to develop this framework by adding a self-learning block to collect additional recommendations and make a comprehensive dataset regarding other multicast messages, including MMS, Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP), Precision Time Protocol (PTP), etc. Also, the quality of generated texts will be assessed by natural language processing to increase the acceptability of LLMs.</p>
