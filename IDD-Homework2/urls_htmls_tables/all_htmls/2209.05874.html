<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">The vision of 5G lies in providing high data rates, low latency (for the aim of near-real-time applications), significantly increased base station capacity, and near-perfect quality of service (QoS) for users, compared to LTE networks. In order to provide such services, 5G systems will support various combinations of access technologies such as LTE, NR, NR-U and Wi-Fi. Each radio access technology (RAT) provides different types of access, and these should be allocated and managed optimally among the users. Besides resource management, 5G systems will also support a dual connectivity service. The orchestration of the network therefore becomes a more difficult problem for system managers with respect to legacy access technologies. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for RAT allocation based on federated meta-learning (FML), which enables RAN intelligent controllers (RICs) to adapt more quickly to dynamically changing environments. We have designed a simulation environment which contains LTE and 5G NR service technologies. In the simulation, our objective is to fulfil UE demands within the deadline of transmission to provide higher QoS values. We compared our proposed algorithm with a single RL agent, the Reptile algorithm and a rule-based heuristic method. Simulation results show that the proposed FML method achieves higher caching rates at first deployment round 21% and 12% respectively. Moreover, proposed approach adapts to new tasks and environments most quickly amongst the compared methods.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The next generation of networks need to support a wide range of demanding applications such as connected autonomous vehicles, 4k video streaming, and ultra-low-power Internet-of-things networks. This variety of services prevents service providers having one simple solution for all users. In order to provide such services, more intelligent and agile solutions are required for mobile network users. To this end, open radio access network (O-RAN) enables radio intelligent controllers (RIC) units to provide a resource management scheme to tackle different problems within the same structure; this is called traffic steering.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Traffic steering is one of the many use cases of O-RAN. There are numerous types of resources needing to be allocated in 5G systems. In addition to cell allocation and band allocation, 5G systems support different combinations of access technologies namely, NR (New radio, licensed band), NR-U (unlicensed band), LTE and Wi-Fi <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Moreover, 5G systems will provide dual connectivity to UEs e.g., while mobile broadband (MBB) service is provided by one cell, voice and low data rate required applications can be provided by other cells.
The RIC requires controlling many combinations to provide high QoS to the users <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Traffic steering is a hard problem which becomes more difficult the larger the number of participants. Thus, heuristic methods often fail to fulfil such high QoS demand. Therefore, machine learning-based algorithms are a more promising way to solve this problem. Machine learning (ML)-based resource allocation for wireless networks have been studied for over a decade <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Yet new problems are still emerging, with new demands and new radio access technologies (RAT) such as effectively managing 5G new radio (NR) features. ML-based algorithms for resource allocation problems often use reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. These methods use a simulated environment to generate data to train RL agents by using these data. While there are number of RL formulations, we used a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method for decision making in simulated environment.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">RL agents that have stochastic environments require an adaptation phase to achieve optimal rewards. In order to increase the convergence speed of model adaptation to the environment, a collaborative learning algorithm, namely federated meta-learning (FML) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> is proposed to orchestrate the network in the O-RAN environment.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">There are several reasons to choose the FL framework for the O-RAN ecosystem. One of the main reasons is to generalise across the distribution of environments for RL agents <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Cellular networks contain highly dynamic and unique environments. Even well-trained RL agents may fail to adapt to the environment after deployment. If RIC management cannot deal with a quickly changing environment, it can cause significant QoE issues for users. Another reason is some areas may have different priorities than others in aspects of service types; for example, some applications may demand higher throughput, and some may need lower latency while communicating.
We defined several QoS metrics such as throughput and latency to generalize the problem within the FML framework.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Our motivation for using meta-learning approach for DRL algorithm is to enhance the adaptation process of RL agents. The reason for focusing on the adaptation process is that wireless communication in RAN is highly dynamic. Moreover, service demands are application-dependent (as mentioned before) and, obtaining optimal solution faster plays a crucial role in intelligent resource management applications. Hence, we aim to train a DQN model that enables RL agent adapt to a new task i.e., latency, throughput, or caching rate, can be quick.</span></p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> paradigm aims to perform training directly on edge devices with their own local data and employs a communication efficient model management scheme. While collected data is kept local, communication between the global server and edge devices contains only model gradients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Therefore, FL is a communication and computation-efficient way of distributed learning algorithms. The server merges these updates to form a better more generic model for all environments. Model updates at local RL agents represent information about local environments. Thus, the global model collects representative information about the deployed environment without getting any state data. This feature prevents both constant data flow from deployed units and keeps private data local such as user equipment’s (UE) locations, routines, data usage, etc. After aggregating model updates at the server, the server forms a global model as a generic model for all agents.</p>

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Federated reinforcement learning (FRL) enables RL agents to generalise environment by using collaborative scheme. Liu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> used FL framework to extend RL agents’ experience so that they can effectively use prior knowledge. Their objective is to improve adaptation speed to a new environment by using this knowledge. Our proposed method uses various environments for the same motivation as well. However, in addition to FL framework, we also employ meta-learning to enable RL agents to adapt faster to new QoS tasks as well as environments.</span></p>

<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The FML algorithm is used to increase converging speeds to unseen tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. This feature enables RL agents or any other DNN-based learning algorithms to adapt to new tasks faster. <span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Yue et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> used FML approach to maximize the theoretical lower bound of global loss reduction in each round to accelerate the convergence. Unlike our approach, they added user selection mechanism according to contributions of local models.</span></p>

<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Besides RL-based methods, there is also recurrent neural network (RNN) based FML methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Zhang et al. used different cities as meta-tasks to train an RNN model to predict network traffic. While they used each city as task, we used each QoS metric in the network as a meta-task in this paper. In both way, tasks are not completely independent. Network traffic for cities usually represents a seasonal behavior that changes accord the time of the day. Therefore, traffic demand changes at similar times but in different volumes. In our paper, we used different QoS metrics as tasks and they are indirectly dependent as well e.g., higher throughput will lead to transmit data in less time and it will decrease the latency.</span></p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">There are many ML-based resource allocation papers in the literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. However, there are only a few studies that use ML to provide a solution to traffic steering use case since it is relatively new problem. <span id="S2.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Adamczyk et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> used an artificial neural network trained with the SARSA algorithm for traffic control in RANs. For traffic steering use case, they allocated resources among the users according to base station load. They defined different user profiles according to their data rate demands. In our paper, we define these demands as meta-tasks. Thus, after the deployment of an RL agent, it adapts to a new demand profile more rapidly.</span></p>

Since the 5G NR service has higher data rates, it can complete jobs faster and reduce the loss of jobs. However, in our simulation setup, we defined a 5G NR data rate as lower than LTE when a UE gets closer to the border of the 5G NR coverage area. We expected our RL agents to learn this pattern and manage resources according.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we use FML algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> to provide both a hierarchical and fast-adapting framework. FL low communication overheads permits deployment at end devices. We consider deployment at either RICs or E2 nodes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> as a resource management unit in the hierarchy. When the FML algorithm is deployed in the field, it will require data with the least latency. Hence, the action decisions of the RL agents will not expire for the collected state information from the environment. We assume state information of simulation is collected close to real-time. Therefore, any latency caused by transmitting data from RU to RIC is ignored in this work. The proposed FML algorithm for traffic steering in O-RAN is given in Algorithm <a href="#alg2" title="In V-A Federated Reinforcement Learning Setup ‣ V Federated Meta-learning for O-RAN Traffic Steering ‣ Federated Meta-Learning for Traffic Steering in O-RAN" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.</p>

To achieve this, RL agents train the model during a meta-learning phase on a set of tasks, such that the trained model can quickly adapt to new tasks using only a small number of adaptation steps <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.
Since RL agents are deployed in a simulation environment where UE trajectories are likely to be unique, RL agents will try to adapt to this unseen environment. Moreover, as mentioned before besides the UE trajectories, the demands of UEs can differ in each environment. Hence, we used four different tasks to train RL agents in the meta-learning phase and observe them adapt to the fifth one. After every four rounds, RL agents update their DQN models according to equation (<a href="#S5.E15" title="In V-B Meta-learning tasks ‣ V Federated Meta-learning for O-RAN Traffic Steering ‣ Federated Meta-Learning for Traffic Steering in O-RAN" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">15</span></a>),</span></p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There are a number of resource types in the O-RAN structure and the demands of UEs can change the scheme of resource management. However, the action space for RL agents grows exponentially with number of dimensions of resources to be managed. Since most of the RL algorithms depend on explore-and-exploit methods, using multiple RL agents collaboratively likely to enhance exploration, and helps RL agents converge to better rewards faster. Hence, this is one of the major reasons for proposing the FML framework for traffic steering in O-RAN. Simulation results show even a single resource type such as the RAT allocation problem can be handled better with collaborative learning of multiple RL agents.</p>

Even though we observed similar training performances for a single RL agent and FML agent, FML performed better in an unseen environment. The FL framework takes advantage of collecting information from various environments, and so it becomes easier to adapt to a new environment. There are cases where a single learner performs better than the global model because of the issue of collected not independent and identically distributed (non-iid) data. Nevertheless, there are other solutions to prevent performance deterioration at the global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have focused on the generalization of different tasks and environments by using the FML framework. As a use case, we used traffic steering in O-RAN architecture. We designed a traffic steering environment to investigate how DRL-based learning algorithms perform in such an environment. While unique environments are created for every RL agent in a stochastic way, RL agents try to manage RIC and allocate RAT services among UEs in the environment. We have analyzed the convergence speed of the DRL algorithm that uses a single task and single environment. Another DRL algorithm that uses multiple tasks in the Reptile algorithm and single environment and proposed FML framework that uses multiple tasks and multiple environments to train RL agents. Simulation results
confirm the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. Future work can investigate how the FML framework deals with managing multiple radio resources on RICs.</p>
