<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, with the rapid advancement of transformer models, transformer-based multimodal architectures have found wide application in various downstream tasks, including but not limited to Image Captioning, Visual Question Answering (VQA), and Image-Text Generation. However, contemporary approaches to Remote Sensing (RS) VQA often involve resource-intensive techniques, such as full fine-tuning of large models or the extraction of image-text features from pre-trained multimodal models, followed by modality fusion using decoders. These approaches demand significant computational resources and time, and a considerable number of trainable parameters are introduced. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel method known as RSAdapter, which prioritizes runtime and parameter efficiency. RSAdapter comprises two key components: the Parallel Adapter and an additional linear transformation layer inserted after each fully connected (FC) layer within the Adapter. This approach not only improves adaptation to pre-trained multimodal models but also allows the parameters of the linear transformation layer to be integrated into the preceding FC layers during inference, reducing inference costs. To demonstrate the effectiveness of RSAdapter, we conduct an extensive series of experiments using three distinct RS-VQA datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results on all three datasets. The code for RSAdapter will be available online at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Y-D-Wang/RSAdapter" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_href">https://github.com/Y-D-Wang/RSAdapter</a>.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Visual Question Answering (VQA) stands as an interdisciplinary field, situated at the crossroads of computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP). Its primary objective revolves around equipping computational systems with the capacity to comprehend and accurately respond to queries formulated in natural language concerning visual content, encompassing images and videos. Recent years have witnessed substantial advancements in the domain of visual question answering, accompanied by the introduction of essential datasets, evaluation metrics, and increasingly sophisticated models, which have expanded the frontiers of research.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Diverging from conventional visual tasks like image classification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, object detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, and semantic segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, the fundamental aim of VQA is to bridge the semantic divide between textual and visual modalities. This objective necessitates the development of models endowed with the capability to reason about the content of visual data based on textual queries. This entails the simultaneous comprehension of both visual content and natural language questions, thereby mandating the integration of computer vision techniques and NLP capabilities. With the advent of the BERT model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> in 2018, the potential of transformer-based models became apparent. Consequently, transformer-based architectures have gained prominence as a solution for VQA. These architectures typically embark on a two-step process, starting with pretraining on a substantial dataset comprising image-text pairs, followed by fine-tuning on specific VQA datasets to achieve superior performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Lu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> introduced ViLBERT (Vision-and-Language BERT), a model designed to learn a unified representation of image content and natural language devoid of task-specific biases. Initially, ViLBERT undergoes pretraining on the Conceptual Captions dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> and subsequently undergoes fine-tuning for four visual-language tasks: visual question answering, visual commonsense reasoning, referring expressions, and caption-based image retrieval. ViLBERT’s architecture requires only minimal modifications when employed for downstream tasks. Subsequently, similar approaches have been presented by other researchers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, all involving the fine-tuning of pre-trained models for images and language separately before integrating them. However, this approach has encountered challenges concerning the harmonization of visual-linguistic aspects. The crux of the task lies in the aggregation of multimodal information.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To attain a more universal representation, Su et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> introduced VL-BERT, which was pre-trained on a comprehensive concept annotation dataset and textual corpora. Chen et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> proposed UNITER, a universal image-text representation method achieved through extensive pretraining on four diverse image-text datasets, including COCO <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, Visual Genome (VG) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, Conceptual Captions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, and SBU Captions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. UNITER offers support for a wide array of heterogeneous downstream tasks by jointly embedding multimodal information.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">VQA has recently gained significant attention in the field of Earth Science and Remote Sensing (RS), particularly with the introduction of several new datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. This makes it a current and cutting-edge research topic in these domains. Lobery et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> were among the first to introduce a simple method where features were extracted separately from images using CNN and from text using LSTM. These features were then combined through element-wise multiplication to obtain a joint representation. Subsequent works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> in this field explored the use of visual features at different levels to enhance the understanding of image content, thereby improving the model’s ability to learn from both images and text. The methods mentioned above are all based on traditional CNN and RNN approaches. Similarly, models based on transformers have also been proposed in this context. Bazi et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> utilized the CLIP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> model to extract image and text features. These features were then separately fed into two parallel decoder transformers to learn a joint representation. Siebert et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> fine-tuned datasets using the VisualBERT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> model.</p>

Therefore, there are doubts about whether pretrained transformer models still exhibit strong transferability on RS-VQA tasks.</p>

The results consistently show that RSAdapter inserted next to the MLP component performed better. Finally, we simultaneously insert RSAdapter next to MSA and MLP components while adding corresponding scaling layers to control the contribution of each RSAdapter to the model effectively. To validate the effectiveness of RSAdapter, we conduct comprehensive experiments on three different RS-VQA datasets, and the results indicated that when freezing all parameters of the pre-trained multimodal model and only updating the newly added lightweight RSAdapter, our proposed method achieves better results than previous state-of-the-art methods.

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Pre-trained Vision-Language models have demonstrated impressive performance on downstream multimodal tasks, including Image Captioning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, Visual Question Answering <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, image-text generation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, and various NLP and CV tasks. For vision-language transformer models, they are typically categorized into two distinct classes known as single-stream transformers and dual-streams transformers.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Currently, most vision-language models use a single-stream approach, which includes only one transformer stack together. They concatenate visual tokens and textual tokens as the input to the transformer. Due to its simplicity, it significantly simplifies the architecture compared to the dual-streams transformers, achieving comparable performance with fewer parameters. Additionally, it offers ease of scalability, as we can handle other modalities’ questions, such as video and audio, by simply concatenating tokens from other modalities. ViLT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, PixelBERT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, VisualBERT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> all belong to the category of single-stream transformers. They all use BERT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> to extract text embeddings, and both PixelBERT and VisualBERT employ CNNs as feature extractors for the image modality. After specific processing, the image features are concatenated with text tokens and fed into the transformer. What sets ViLT apart from other models is its use of a straightforward linear projection to obtain image embeddings. This simplifies the structure of ViLT, leading to increased runtime and parameter efficiency. It is precisely this characteristic that led us to choose ViLT as our backbone model in this paper.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recent research has underscored the significant potential of large-scale models. The ever-increasing model sizes have, in turn, escalated the demand for computational resources required to fine-tune these models for downstream tasks. This trend has sparked substantial research interest in the realm of Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT). Initially, PEFT methods found their applications in Natural Language Processing (NLP), offering efficient transfer of large pre-trained models to downstream tasks with the introduction of only a small number of trainable parameters, while keeping the original large model parameters frozen. In certain tasks, this approach can even outperform the performance achieved by fully fine-tuning the model.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The pioneering PEFT method, Adapter <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, as proposed by Houlsby et al., involves embedding a compact task-specific MLP network into a large pre-trained model to facilitate adaptation to downstream tasks. Prefix tuning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> and Prompt tuning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> entail the fine-tuning of large pre-trained models through the introduction of new trainable task-specific vectors or virtual token embeddings. Low-Rank Adaptation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> (LoRA) augments the parameters by introducing trainable low-rank matrices to the multi-head attentions in the large pre-trained model. Building upon these foundational PEFT methods, subsequent works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> have achieved superior results on downstream tasks by combining various techniques. In addition to the aforementioned mainstream methods, Bitfit <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> has demonstrated that updating only the bias terms can yield satisfactory results in specific downstream tasks.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In contrast to the methods mentioned above that use traditional CNN and LSTM models for feature extraction, Bazi et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> introduced a transformer-based VQA approach. They initially utilized the CLIP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> model to separately extract text and image features, and then employed transformer decoders based on co-attention to capture the relationship between images and text. Chappuis et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> initially processed image information for classification and generated text prompts. These prompts were then input into a language model for answer prediction. Siebert et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> employed the VisualBERT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> model to better learn joint representation.</p>

<div id="S2.SS3.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> introduced a hash-based spatial multiscale visual learning method to enhance the perception of spatial positional information. Additionally, in the final visual-text fusion stage, they employed a complex interaction module to capture image-text interaction information.</p>

<div id="S2.SS3.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p5.1" class="ltx_p">It is worth noting that Bazi et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> introduced an encoder-decoder structure, increasing the model’s complexity, while Siebert et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> performed full fine-tuning on VisualBERT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, requiring substantial computational resources and runtime. Compared to these existing transformer-based methods, RSAdapter achieves efficient fine-tuning without increasing model complexity, saving training time and computational resources. Based on these points, we believe that the proposed method is an effective addition to the current RS-VQA field.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">After the introduction of the Vision Transformer (ViT) by Dosovitskiy et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>, transformers have made significant inroads into the field of CV. Transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) have consequently found widespread application in a variety of multi-modal tasks, including VQA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. In this study, our objective is to design an efficient network based on a pre-trained multimodal model for the purpose of RS-VQA. Additionally, we aim to assess its performance in comparison to other existing models that have been specifically tailored for this task.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In a typical ViT model, an image is traditionally divided into a series of small patches. To maintain the original ViT model methodology as closely as possible, while avoiding the introduction of additional complex modules, we have selected ViLT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> as our baseline model. Specifically, ViLT utilizes a pre-trained BERT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> to extract word and position embeddings for the text component. For images, it employs patch projection instead of heavy feature extraction models to extract regional or grid features.</p>

Recently, multimodal models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> have even exhibited remarkable few-shot and zero-shot capabilities because they effectively learned the relationships between image-text pairs. Despite our dataset consisting of RS images, which significantly differ from the natural images in the pre-trained dataset, our results indicate that we can still achieve competitive outcomes through efficient fine-tuning. This is possible because the multimodal model has already undergone effective pre-training on extensive image-text datasets, giving it strong transferability. Inspired by efficient fine-tuning techniques in NLP and CV, we have adopted the Adapter framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.</p>

In total, the dataset includes 1,066,316 image-question-answer triplets, with approximately 100 questions and their corresponding answers for each image. All the questions are categorized into four different types: count, presence, comparison, and area. After a thorough analysis of all the answers, we have identified a total of 94 possible answers. For our experiments, we use 61.5% of the dataset as the training set, 11.2% as the validation set, and the remaining 27.3% as the test set to evaluate our model’s effectiveness. It is important to note that this dataset includes two separate test sets, HR1 and HR2. Among these test sets, HR1 covers an area similar to the training and validation sets, while HR2, designed to assess the model’s generalization capabilities, covers an area entirely distinct from the training set. Additionally, HR2 uses data collected by a different sensor.</p>

Noticeably, our method outperforms all other approaches in the majority of evaluation metrics. Remarkably, RSAdapter achieves an Average Accuracy (AA) of 87.78% and an Overall Accuracy (OA) of 87.14%, demonstrating substantial improvements of 0.44% and 1.29%, respectively, when compared to the latest SHRNet model. Compared to the baseline RSVQA model, it achieves even more remarkable improvements of 6.29% and 8.06%, respectively.
Specifically, within the four distinct question categories, RSAdapter achieves the best results in Count, Presence, and Comparison, with improvements of around 1% in each category. However, in the Rural/Urban category, our method falls short of SHRNet’s performance. This discrepancy can be attributed to the fact that only 1% of the dataset is allocated to this category, underscoring the challenge of achieving optimal results for sparsely represented categories in imbalanced datasets.</p>

Our method has demonstrated improvements compared to other models on both test sets. On the first test set, we achieve an AA of 85.52% and an OA of 85.81%. On the second test set, our AA and OA are 81.15% and 81.68%, respectively. Our method also exhibits superior performance in the majority of categories, with only a small gap (0.02%-0.19%) compared to the best model in other categories. It is important to note that the performance on the second test set is significantly lower, with a decrease of 4.37% for AA and 4.13% for OA compared to the first test set. This discrepancy is primarily due to the fact that the image data in the second test set originates from a different region compared to the rest of the dataset and employs different sensors for capture. This underscores the significant challenge posed by the data-shift problem for current methods. Furthermore, the differences between various methods in the HR dataset are noticeably smaller compared to the LR dataset. This indicates that with an increase in training data, the disparities between the results of different methods gradually diminish.</p>

Our method has achieved an AA of 84.34% and an OA of 87.10% on the RSIVQA dataset, representing significant improvements (4.3% increase for AA and 2.76% increase for OA) compared to the SHRNet model.
In the ’Others’ category, we achieve an accuracy of 92.47%, representing a substantial improvement of 7.87% compared to the best results from other models. In the ’Number’ category, we also observe a notable improvement of 5.93%. However, it’s worth noting that the performance in the ’Number’ category improved by only 0.26% compared to SHRNet, indicating that extracting quantity-related features from images remains a challenging task for the current method.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In Table <a href="#S4.T5" title="TABLE V ‣ IV-D Ablation Studies ‣ IV Experiments ‣ RSAdapter: Adapting Multimodal Models for Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">V</span></a>, we present a detailed comparison of different components of RSAdapter and other PEFT methods, including Bitfit <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, Adapter <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, and Lora <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. Additionally, we report the results of linear probing and full fine-tuning for reference.
To analyze the impact of different RSAdapter insertion positions, we provide two variants: RSAdapter(MSA), inserted in parallel alongside MSA, and RSAdapter(MLP), inserted in parallel alongside MLP. From the table, it is evident that the full RSAdapter consistently achieves the best results across all three different test sets. Notably, RSAdapter(MLP) exhibits varying degrees of improvement over RSAdapter(MSA) across all datasets. This suggests that during the model’s efficient fine-tuning stage, tuning the MLP tends to be more beneficial than tuning the MSA. When compared to other PEFT methods, the full RSAdapter significantly outperforms them when tuning an equivalent number of parameters. It is worth noting that, in the majority of datasets, the results of the Adapter method are superior to the other two methods, further confirming the effectiveness of the Adapter approach. Compared to full fine-tuning of the entire model, our approach achieves comparable results with only a small fraction of parameters tuned and, in some datasets, even exhibits slight improvements.</p>

<div id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In further validation of the applicability of our method, we conduct additional experiments using two unimodal large models, ViT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> and BERT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Since ViT and BERT can only handle one modality of input each, we perform element-wise multiplication between the image features and text features obtained from these two models. Subsequently, we feed this combined image-text feature into the classification layer to obtain our answers. From Table <a href="#S4.T6" title="TABLE VI ‣ IV-D2 Different Backbone Models ‣ IV-D Ablation Studies ‣ IV Experiments ‣ RSAdapter: Adapting Multimodal Models for Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VI</span></a>, it is evident that our method, with only half the parameter updates compared to ViT+BERT, outperforms it on three different datasets when using the ViLT model. This suggests that, even with a smaller parameter count in the multimodal backbone model, our method performs better than using unimodal backbone models.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To assess the data efficiency of our method, we analyze RSAdapter’s performance under conditions of limited training data. We employ dataset subsets representing proportions of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 and report the results of all three datasets in Table <a href="#S4.T7" title="TABLE VII ‣ IV-D3 Data Efficiency ‣ IV-D Ablation Studies ‣ IV Experiments ‣ RSAdapter: Adapting Multimodal Models for Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VII</span></a>. Remarkably, even with very limited data, we are able to achieve acceptable results. Notably, our method can outperform other models trained on the complete dataset, even when using only half of the data (e.g., achieving a 2.19% increase for AA and a 1.21% increase for OA on the RSIVQA dataset). In Fig. <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ IV-D3 Data Efficiency ‣ IV-D Ablation Studies ‣ IV Experiments ‣ RSAdapter: Adapting Multimodal Models for Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, we compare the results of RSAdapter and Bi-Modal when using only 10% and 20% of the data on LR and HR datasets. RSAdapter outperforms Bi-Modal on both LR and HR datasets, except for the AA on 10% of LR. This discrepancy is due to the class imbalance in the LR dataset, where the Rural/Urban category has a significant impact on the final AA. In Fig. <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ IV-D3 Data Efficiency ‣ IV-D Ablation Studies ‣ IV Experiments ‣ RSAdapter: Adapting Multimodal Models for Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, we also present the results of RSAdapter on the RSIVQA dataset across various training subsets, different categories, AA and OA. In conclusion, our method demonstrates the ability to achieve satisfactory results even with limited data.</p>

Remarkably, when RSAdapter is inserted into the lower layers, the results consistently outperform those when inserted into the upper layers. This could be attributed to the fact that there may be slight differences in low-level features between natural images and remote sensing images, leading to significant variations in results when fine-tuning a model pre-trained on natural images for remote sensing images.</p>

<p id="S4.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we begin by visualizing examples that compare the model’s predictions with ground truth (GT) in Fig. <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ IV-E Visulization ‣ IV Experiments ‣ RSAdapter: Adapting Multimodal Models for Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>. The first and second rows in the images are examples where the answers are correctly predicted, while the bottom row represents examples where the answers are incorrectly predicted.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Then we demonstrate the attention map visualization of the RSAdapter over images and questions in Fig. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ IV-E Visulization ‣ IV Experiments ‣ RSAdapter: Adapting Multimodal Models for Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>. We start by extracting the class token output from the last transformer layer along with the attention matrices for both image and text. We then average the results from all attention heads to obtain the final attention maps.</p>

<div id="S4.SS5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In Fig. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ IV-E Visulization ‣ IV Experiments ‣ RSAdapter: Adapting Multimodal Models for Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>(a), we present an example from the LR dataset, which asks if there is a grass area in the image. Consequently, the model focuses primarily on the grass object. Similarly, for questions from the HR dataset, we showcase two examples in Fig. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ IV-E Visulization ‣ IV Experiments ‣ RSAdapter: Adapting Multimodal Models for Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>(b). For the first example, this question asks if there is a water area in the image. Since there is no water present in the image, only a small portion of the image is attended to, indicating the absence of a water area in the image. For another HR example, the question involves counting the number of roads. Therefore, the model assigns varying levels of attention to objects resembling roads in order to infer the answer. In Fig. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ IV-E Visulization ‣ IV Experiments ‣ RSAdapter: Adapting Multimodal Models for Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>(c), we also present an example from the RSIVQA dataset where the question pertains to the subject of the image. As a result, the model focuses on different objects. We can observe from attention map that the model successfully emphasizes residential objects.</p>

<div id="S4.SS5.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">While the examples presented demonstrate that the model effectively captures the relationship between images and text, it is worth noting that the model may still struggle with object recognition because specific object boundaries were not provided during training. Additionally, since many questions in the datasets are auto-generated, they might not always be relevant to the images, making it challenging to align the image and text relationships, which can affect the final performance of the model.</p>

The training and testing times represent the average time for one epoch, and the experiment was conducted on an Nvidia RTX A6000 GPU. From the results, we can infer that our method requires a similar amount of time for training one epoch compared to the RSVQA model, even though it has slightly more tunable parameters. However, our method achieves nearly twice the inference speed of RSVQA. Notably, SHRNet’s training time is 3.8 times longer than RSVQA, and its testing time is 3.3 times longer than RSVQA based on <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. This strongly suggests that our model provides a substantial improvement in runtime efficiency compared to SHRNet. In terms of parameter comparison, SHRNet has 105.56 million training parameters, whereas we achieve better results on all three datasets with only 10% of SHRNet’s parameter count. These experiments demonstrate the runtime and parameter efficiency of our method.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a novel approach, namely RSAdapter, to efficiently fine-tune pre-trained multimodal models, enabling them to better adapt to RS-VQA tasks. First, a novel re-parameterization method is applied to the parallel adapter, then we simultaneously insert RSAdapter next to MSA and MLP components while adding corresponding scaling layers to control the contribution of each RSAdapter to the model effectively. By conducting validation on three different RS-VQA datasets, we have achieved better performance compared to previous works. At the same time, our training parameters and inference time have significantly decreased. Furthermore, our method can be easily applied to other large models. Despite the numerous advantages of our method, it still has several limitations. The first limitation is that the current RSAdapter fine-tuning method still requires a substantial number of tunable parameters. The second limitation is that the current pre-trained multi-modal model is trained on natural images, and there may still be a gap when transferring to remote sensing images.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In future work, we aim to achieve efficient fine-tuning by pre-training multimodal models on a large number of remote sensing images, thereby avoiding the loss associated with transferring from natural images to remote sensing images. Additionally, we hope to discover better methods to further reduce the size of the training parameters without sacrificing performance as much as possible.</p>
