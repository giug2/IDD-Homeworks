<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning has become an important learning paradigm due to its privacy and computational benefits. As the field advances, two key challenges that still remain to be addressed are: (1) system heterogeneity - variability in the compute and/or data resources present on each client, and (2) lack of labeled data in certain federated settings. Several recent developments have tried to overcome these challenges independently. In this work, we propose a unified and systematic framework, <em id="id4.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Heterogeneous Self-supervised Federated Learning</em> (Hetero-SSFL) for enabling self-supervised learning with federation on heterogeneous clients. The proposed framework allows collaborative representation learning across all the clients without imposing architectural constraints or requiring presence of labeled data. The key idea in Hetero-SSFL is to let each client train its unique self-supervised model and enable the joint learning across clients by aligning the lower dimensional representations on a common dataset. The entire training procedure could be viewed as self and peer-supervised as both the local training and the alignment procedures do not require presence of any labeled data. As in conventional self-supervised learning, the obtained client models are task independent and can be used for varied end-tasks.
We provide a convergence guarantee of the proposed framework for non-convex objectives in heterogeneous settings and also empirically demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the state of the art methods by a significant margin.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning has become an important learning paradigm for training algorithms in a privacy preserving way and has gained a lot of interest in the recent past. While traditional federated learning is capable of learning high performing models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021b</a>)</cite>, two practical challenges that remain under studied are: system heterogeneity, and lack of labeled data. In several real world scenarios, the clients involved in the training process are highly heterogeneous in terms of their data and compute resources. Requiring each client to train identical models like in traditional FL may thus be severely limiting. Similarly, assuming each client’s local data resources to be fully labeled may not be pragmatic as annotating data is time consuming and may require expertise.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our focus in this work is to jointly address these two challenges in a systemic way so as to make FL more practical. Some prior works have studied these two issues separately. For instance, to help with scarcity of labeled data on local clients, use of semi-supervised learning has been recently studied <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhang et al., <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021b</a>; Jeong et al., <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Lu et al., <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>; other very recently proposed approaches suggest the use of locally self-supervised learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhuang et al., <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>, <a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; He et al., <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> assuming identical model architectures on each client. System heterogeneity on the other hand is commonly addressed by building heterogeneous personalised models on clients as suggested in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Makhija et al., <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Tan et al., <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Jiang et al., <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Fallah et al., <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> but all of these approaches assume the presence of fully labeled data on all of the clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Though the above mentioned approaches have shown promising results in dealing with both the problems in isolation, in certain real-world applications these two challenges need to be jointly addressed in a holistic way. For example, some of the key applications of FL in cross-silo settings are in healthcare systems where different hospitals may possess varying amounts of private medical images or in cross-device settings where end-devices such as sensors acquire loads of unlabeled data. In both these cases, the data can neither be centralised nor can undergo extensive annotations, moreover to expect each client (a hospital or a sensor in the above examples) to train local models of identical capacities will be highly inhibiting.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we circumvent these problems by proposing a new framework that allows clients to train self-supervised models with unique (locally tuned) structures while still using the learnings from other clients in the network, in an architecture agnostic way. To achieve this, we add a proximal term to each client’s loss function that helps in aligning the learnt lower dimensional representations (aka embeddings) across clients. This way of transferring and acquiring global knowledge allows variability in client model architectures while keeping the entire learning process independent of labeled training data. Furthermore, we use a kernel based distance metric for proximity calculation which provides much more flexibility to the clients in defining their own lower dimensional space without any constraints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies collaborative unsupervised learning in a distributed heterogeneous client setting.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The problem of training machine learning models in distributed environments with restrictions on data/model sharing was studied by several researchers in the data mining community in the early 2000s under titles such as (privacy preserving) distributed data mining <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kargupta and Park, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2000</a>; Gan et al., <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>; Aggarwal and Yu, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2008</a>)</cite>. Much of this work was for specific procedures such as distributed clustering <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Merugu and Ghosh, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">Nov, 2003</a>)</cite> including in heterogenous settings with different feature spaces <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Merugu and Ghosh, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2005</a>)</cite>, and distributed PCA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kargupta et al., <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2001</a>)</cite>, or for specific models such as SVMs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yu et al., <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">2006</a>)</cite>. Subsequently, with the re-surfacing in popularity of neural networks and proliferation of powerful deep learning approaches, the term <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_inline-quote ltx_outerquote">“Federated Learning”</span> got coined and popularized largely by an influential paper <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al., <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> which introduced FedAvg. Indeed FedAvg is now considered the standard distributed training method for Federated Learning, which has become a very active area of research since then. One of the key challenges in this setting is the presence of non-iid datasets across clients. Several modifications of the original FedAvg algorithm have been proposed to address this challenge. Some of these approaches focus on finding better solutions to the optimization problem to prevent the divergence of the global solution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Karimireddy et al., <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Zhang et al., <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021a</a>; Pathak and Wainwright, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Acar et al., <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> whereas some suggest the modification of the training procedure to incorporate appropriate aggregation of the local models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Chen and Chao, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Wang et al., <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020a</a>; Yurochkin et al., <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Wang et al., <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020b</a>; Singh and Jaggi, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. Creating local personalised models for each client to improve the overall method is also well researched <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Collins et al., <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Ghosh et al., <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Smith et al., <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017a</a>; Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021b</a>; Smith et al., <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017b</a>; Sattler et al., <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Yu et al., <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>.

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The interest in self-supervised federated learning is relatively new. Although MOON <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021a</a>)</cite> proposed using a contrastive loss in supervised federated learning, it was FedU <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhuang et al., <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> that proposed a way to leverage unlabeled data in a decentralised setting. Subsequently, two parallel works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhuang et al., <a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>,  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(He et al., <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> proposed frameworks for training self-supervised models in a federated setting and compared different self-supervised models. In all of these approaches though, the clients train local models of identical architectures. This common architecture is communicated by the server at the beginning of the training. In each round, the clients perform update steps on the local models and send the local models to the central server at the end of the round. The server appropriately aggregates the client models to generate the global model for that round and communicates the global model parameters back to each client. The prominent idea in these latest developments is the divergence aware updates of the local model to the global model wherein, if the local models are very different from the global model, the local models are not updated with the global model, which can be seen as an initial step towards creating more personalised models for each client.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to enable federated learning for heterogeneous clients in an unsupervised way, we propose a new framework using self-supervised federated learning and name it Hetero-SSFL. This framework is unique as it allows heterogeneous clients to participate in the training process and also exhibits high empirical performance. The convergence guarantee of the algorithm for non-convex loss functions is also shown. In this section we first formally describe the problem setting and then elaborate on our proposed solution.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p1.6" class="ltx_p">We assume each client contains unlabeled datasets and employ self-supervised learning on each client. While there are many ways to achieve self-supervision, in this work we focus on non-contrastive methods like BYOL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Grill et al., <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> and SimSiam <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Chen and He, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> which involve two embedding architectures like Siamese networks for achieving self-supervision. The two parallel networks are called the <span id="S3.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p1.6.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">online</span> network and <span id="S3.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p1.6.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">target</span> network respectively. The target network’s task is to provide targets for regression to the online network whereas the online network is trained to learn representations. The target network consists of an encoder and the online network is composed of an encoder and a prediction layer on top of it, whose role is to learn better representations under self-supervision loss. The weights of the target network are just a moving average of the weights of the online network and the target network can thus be thought of as a stable version of the online network.

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p2.10" class="ltx_p">In our framework, the learning on each client is also guided by peers to bring about collaboration. We use this guidance in the form of representations that each client locally learns for a common set of instances. The intuition is that the clients can work together to uncover the hidden representation structure in the data in an unsupervised way. Specifically, we modify the local loss function at each client to contain a proximal term that measures the distance between the local representations and the representations obtained on all other clients. The local loss function at each client thus becomes -</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The role of the proximal term is to compare the representations obtained from various neural networks. This requires the distance function to be able to meaningfully capture the similarity in the high dimensional representational space. Moreover, the distance function should be such that it is sensitive to the changes that affect functional behavior and does not change as much with the inconsequential modifications like change in random initializations. The types of distance functions used in the literature for comparing neural network representations include Canonical Correlation Analysis(CCA), Centered Kernel ALignment(CKA) and Procustres distance based measures <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ding et al., <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Kornblith et al., <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. While the Procustres distance based metrics cannot compare the representations obtained in spaces of different dimensions, the CCA based metrics are not suitable for training through backpropagation. In contrast, properties of the CKA metric like ability to learn similarities between layers of different widths, invariance to random initializations, invertible linear transformations and orthogonal transformations lend it useful for use in the proximal term.</p>

<div id="S3.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS3.p3.7" class="ltx_p">CKA measures the distance between the objects in different representation spaces by creating similarity(kernel) matrices in the individual space and then comparing these similarity matrices. The idea is to use the representational similarity matrices to characterize the representation space. CKA takes the activation matrices obtained from the network as inputs and gives a similarity score between 0 and 1 by comparing the similarities between all objects.

CKA also allows choice of other kernels like RBF-kernel, polynomial kernel etc.
but we observed that the results with Linear-CKA are as good as those with RBF kernel as also reported in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kornblith et al., <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. Thus we focus only on Linear-CKA here.</p>

<figcaption class="ltx_caption"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_figure">Figure 1: </span>Overview of the proposed framework: Hetero-SSFL. In each training round, the server sends the RAD and the aggregated representation matrix to all clients, each client trains local self-supervised models by optimising the combined loss, the representations obtained using local model on RAD are sent back to the server which aggregates the representations and sends it back to all clients for next training round. Note: the local models are named Resnet-18 and Resnet-50 as examples to depict heterogeneous client models.</figcaption>

<p id="S5.SS1.SSS0.Px3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We compare our method against two very recently proposed federated self-supervised baselines: FedU and FedEMA, which reflect the current state-of-the-art. Since the source code for these baselines is not publicly available, (though they have been promised in the future as per our personal communications), we perform these comparisons using our implementation and with the best parameters reported in these papers. We also create additional baselines by combining central SSL algorithms like BYOL and SimSiam with the federated learning procedure of FedAvg to make FedBYOL and FedSimSiam. The performance of supervised FedAvg and centralised BYOL is also reported for comparisons as theoretical baselines. All of these methods however work in homogeneous settings, hence we compare the homogeneous setting of baselines with Resnet-34 architecture with our heterogeneous setting having a mix of Resnet-34 and Resnet-18 architectures. One additional baseline is the SSFL algorithm, but due to the unavailability of the source code and lack of precise implementation details in the paper, we could not compare against it.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.SSS0.Px4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We follow the linear evaluation protocol as mentioned in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhuang et al., <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> to test the models. Under this protocol, the local encoders are trained in self-supervised way without any labeled data and then a linear classifier is trained on top of the encoder after freezing the encoder parameters. We use a linear fully connected layer with 1000 neurons as the classifier and train it for 100 epochs with Adam optimizer, batch size = 512 and learning rate = 0.003. The reported results are the accuracy of the linear classifier on a separate test dataset.</p>

For the RAD size we observe that increasing the size of RAD increases performance but has an effect on the speed of simulation so we fix that size to be 5000 in our experiments.

We observe that our method outperforms the baselines by a significant margin and is slightly worse than the central BYOL which implies that we are able to achieve successful collaboration amongst clients. We also report the performance of our method and high-performing baselines with increase in scale in Table <a href="#S5.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 5.2 Results ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Federated Self-supervised Learning for Heterogeneous Clients" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. As the number of clients increase, the assumption on high availability of clients is relaxed and in every round only a fraction of clients are sampled to perform local training, total 20 clients with 5 clients selected per round is denoted as 20clients(5) in Table <a href="#S5.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 5.2 Results ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Federated Self-supervised Learning for Heterogeneous Clients" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work we study the problem of self-supervised federated learning with heterogeneous clients and propose a novel framework to enable collaboration in such settings. The framework allows clients with varying data/compute resources to partake in the collaborative training procedure. This development enables several practical settings to still gainfully employ self-supervised FL even though the different clients, for example different edge-devices or distinct organisations, might not have similar compute and data resources. The high performance of the framework across multiple datasets indicates its promise in achieving collaboration while the theoretical results guarantee the convergence of the algorithm for fairly general loss functions. In future work we plan to investigate the use of attention based mechanisms for adaptive weighting of different clients to generate aggregate representations based on each client’s relative importance. Also, rather than assuming that the server has access to an unlabeled dataset and transmitting RAD from the server to clients, we can create a common generative model in a federated way like federated GANs to generate data instances required for RAD.</p>
