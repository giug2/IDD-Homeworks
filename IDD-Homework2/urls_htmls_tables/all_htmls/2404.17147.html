<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Cooperative perception is essential to enhance the efficiency and safety of future transportation systems, requiring extensive data sharing among vehicles on the road, which raises significant privacy concerns.
Federated learning offers a promising solution by enabling data privacy-preserving collaborative enhancements in perception, decision-making, and planning among connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs).
However, federated learning is impeded by significant challenges arising from data heterogeneity across diverse clients, potentially diminishing model accuracy and prolonging convergence periods.
This study introduces a specialized federated learning framework for CP, termed the federated dynamic weighted aggregation (FedDWA) algorithm, facilitated by dynamic adjusting loss (DALoss) function.
This framework employs dynamic client weighting to direct model convergence and integrates a novel loss function that utilizes Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) to counteract the detrimental effects of non-independently and identically distributed (Non-IID) and unbalanced data.
Utilizing the BEV transformer as the primary model, our rigorous testing on the OpenV2V dataset, augmented with FedBEVT data, demonstrates significant improvements in the average intersection over union (IoU).
These results highlight the substantial potential of our federated learning framework to address data heterogeneity challenges in CP, thereby enhancing the accuracy of environmental perception models and facilitating more robust and efficient collaborative learning solutions in the transportation sector.</p>

These technologies also play a critical role in enhancing cooperative intelligent transportation systems (C-ITS), significantly improving transportation safety and efficiency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
The rise of C-ITS has drawn considerable interest from both academia and industry, highlighting a collaborative framework that integrates various ITS components—personal, vehicle, roadside, and central systems—to surpass traditional ITS models in service quality.
Connected automated vehicles (CAVs) exchange information through vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks, including vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), vehicle-to-network (V2N), and infrastructure-to-network (I2N).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A major challenge within C-ITS is the security and privacy of shared data.
Federated learning in general offers a robust solution by enabling decentralized model training without compromising data privacy, which has already been demonstrated in many applications like wireless communications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, Industry 4.0. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> and robotics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, etc.
In C-ITS, this approach also allows CAVs to collaboratively participate in environment perception, traffic flow prediction, and decision-making, to improve deep neural network (DNN) models while keeping the privacy protected by avoiding exchange sensor data or latent features between CAVs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
Additionally, V2X communication supports seamless data exchange between vehicles, roadside units (RSUs), and cloud systems, enhancing the effectiveness of federated learning in C-ITS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.
Supported by RSUs, digital twins can produce accurate labels for learning algorithms, thereby increasing the precision and performance of the systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Despite its numerous advantages, the federated learning paradigm encounters a significant challenge in data heterogeneity when implemented across diverse clients.
This issue is particularly pronounced in C-ITS perception which is also known as cooperative perception (CP) due to the varied sensor configurations among participating vehicles and infrastructure.
Such variations include discrepancies in camera counts, sensor placements, and non-independently and identically distributed (Non-IID) data among traffic agents, leading to marked differences in data characteristics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.
This diversity presents a significant challenge for traditional federated learning methods, as it may be challenging to effectively synchronize the contributions of local models towards the convergence of the global model.
This paper explores strategies to harness the benefits of external data while mitigating the impacts of data heterogeneity within a federated learning framework, with the aim of significantly improving the performance of local models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Among the critical tasks essential for CP, bird’s-eye-view (BEV) perception is emphasized due to its key role in achieving comprehensive environmental awareness.
To address the challenge of data heterogeneity, we introduce a novel federated learning framework specifically designed for BEV perception.
Specifically, we proposed an advanced aggregation methodology within our federated learning framework, to confront with varied data distributions among clients and their disparate impacts on global model convergence.
This aggregation mechanism is designed to handle the heterogeneity intrinsic to diverse agents, thereby enhancing training efficiency and model efficacy.
Additionally, we introduced a novel loss function designed to mitigate unstable convergence issues, steering the model toward alignment with the global optimizer.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To validate our approach with fair comparison, we conducted extensive experiments and follow the same BEV vision model proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, which consists of five main components: an encoder for image feature extraction; positional embedding to capture camera geometry; a cross-attention module that transitions front views to BEV; convolution layers within transformers for feature refinement; and a decoder to convert BEV representations into actionable predictions.
The results demonstrate the superiority of our framework, showing improved test accuracy and reduced communication overhead across most clients, thus confirming the effectiveness of the proposed federated learning framework in addressing the complex challenges.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">It is essential that autonomous driving systems have the ability to perceive the environment accurately.
This perception directly affects the efficiency of decision-making and overall safety.
Traditional systems, constrained by limited sensing capabilities, often struggle with occlusions and distant objects.
CP, enabled by V2X communications, marks a significant improvement, allowing CAVs to enhance perception through extensive wireless information sharing, encompassing V2V, V2I, and V2N communications.
OpenCDA, introduced by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, provides a versatile framework for developing and testing cooperative driving automation (CDA) systems within a simulated environment.
Complementarily, the work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> presented a large-scale simulated dataset for V2V perception, enriched with a diverse collection of scenes and annotated data.
This dataset proves critical for advancing CP systems, as supported by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, which underscores the expanded sensing capabilities facilitated by V2X.
Further developments include the CoBEVT framework introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, a sparse vision transformer tailored for autonomous driving that leverages multi-agent multi-camera sensors, enabling collaborative perception across multiple vehicles.
The work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> discusses the integral role of advanced algorithms in optimizing CP systems.
The works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> explore the potential of integrating infrastructure-based sensors to bolster CP.
There have been some notable advancements in perception frameworks recently.
One of these is the introduction of V2X-ViT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>.
V2X-ViT is a novel vision Transformer designed to effectively combine information from on-road agents.
Another important contribution is the work by Xu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>.
They have created the first extensive real-world multimodal dataset for V2V perception.
This dataset significantly enhances data availability for CP research.
Lastly, Xiang et al. have introduced HM-ViT in their paper <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>.
HM-ViT is an innovative multi-agent hetero-modal cooperative perception framework.
It can accurately predict 3D objects in dynamic V2V scenarios.
Collectively, these advancements represent a major leap towards more comprehensive and precise environmental perception in autonomous driving, addressing critical challenges and enhancing driving safety.</p>

A primary challenge in federated learning is the management of data heterogeneity and distribution shifts, which complicate efficient model optimization.
The work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> introduces a method to mitigate client heterogeneity by incorporating proximal terms, ensuring that local model updates align with the global model.
Additionally, the work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> utilizes knowledge distillation techniques to aggregate locally computed logits, allowing for the synthesis of cohesive global models without requiring uniform local model architectures.
Further addressing this heterogeneity, the works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> propose algorithms that adjust the training objective to tackle these challenges effectively.
The work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> introduced SCAFFOLD, which employs control variables for variance reduction to correct ‘client-drift’ in local updates.
Moreover, the work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> presents FedSAM, an algorithm that integrates sharpness aware minimization (SAM) as a local optimizer with a momentum-based federated learning algorithm to enhance synergy between local and global models.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In CP involving CAVs and RSUs, the exchange of sensor data raises significant privacy concerns. This data, sourced from vehicles and smart city infrastructure, can reveal sensitive information about individuals, such as location and personal habits.
To address this, the work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> applied federated learning to object detection tasks in AVs, capitalizing on the method’s ability to train models without compromising data privacy.
However, the broader application of federated learning in CP was initially underexplored.
Recent studies such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> discuss the application of federated learning in CP settings.
The work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> introduces an innovative federated learning framework, H2-Fed, designed to handle Hierarchical Heterogeneity, significantly improving conventional pre-trained deep learning models for CP.
Furthermore, the work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> proposes a new client selection pipeline using V2X communications, optimizing client selection based on predicted communication latency in real CP scenarios.
These developments underscore the potential for federated learning for collaborative model training in privacy-sensitive environments.
Despite these advances, implementing CP through federated learning presents challenges, primarily due to heterogeneity in data distribution, computational resources, and network connectivity among devices.
This variability can significantly affect learning efficiency and effectiveness.
To address these challenges, the work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite> introduces a fair and efficient algorithm to manage the imbalanced distribution of data and fluctuating channel conditions.
Moreover, the work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> proposed FedBEVT, a federated transformer learning approach that focuses on BEV perception to tackle common data heterogeneity issues in CP.</p>

Within this framework, each client independently trains a local model using their dataset and then transmits the model updates to a central server.
The server integrates these updates to improve the global model.
This cycle of local training and central updating repeats across several communication rounds to refine the global model optimally.</p>

It comprises an image feature encoder utilizing a CNN, a BEV transformer with a multi-layer attention structure (incorporating both sparse cross-view and self-attention mechanisms), and a BEV decoder.
This configuration effectively encodes images from multiple cameras and transforms them into BEV features.
Processed through FedBEVT, these features are decoded to produce semantic segmentation outputs from the BEV perspective, which are essential for accurately determining the positions of surrounding vehicles on the motion plane.</p>

(i) the heterogeneity of data and distribution shifts across different clients, and
(ii) the varying contributions of different clients to the convergence of the global model.
These enhancements are vital to ensure robust and precise model performance in autonomous driving environments.</p>

Similar to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, we begin by sending these images through a 3-layer ResNet34 encoder, which is proficient at extracting and encoding image features across various spatial dimensions.

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of federated learning frameworks for optimizing transformer-based models in BEV perception within road traffic datasets.
A primary focus of our investigation is the challenge of data heterogeneity, which significantly impedes the performance of federated learning methodologies.
To address this issue, we introduce an innovative algorithm, FedDWA, together with DALoss, specifically designed to mitigate the adverse effects of data diversity.
Our comparative analyses with existing federated learning frameworks demonstrate that our proposed solutions significantly enhance the efficacy of the federated learning framework.
These improvements are primarily achieved through dynamic adjustments of the model convergence direction and the equitable integration of diverse local models into a unified global model.
Our findings underscore the viability and potential of federated learning frameworks in BEV perception, suggesting the approach as a resilient, efficient, and inclusive alternative for model training.</p>
