<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Despite achieving good performance and wide adoption, machine learning based security detection models (e.g., malware classifiers) are subject to concept drift and evasive evolution of attackers, which renders up-to-date threat data as a necessity. However, due to enforcement of various privacy protection regulations (e.g., GDPR), it is becoming increasingly challenging or even prohibitive for security vendors to collect individual-relevant and privacy-sensitive threat datasets, e.g., SMS spam/non-spam messages from mobile devices. To address such obstacles, this study systematically profiles the (in)feasibility of federated learning for privacy-preserving cyber threat detection in terms of effectiveness, byzantine resilience, and efficiency. This is made possible by the build-up of multiple threat datasets and threat detection models, and more importantly, the design of realistic and security-specific experiments.</p>
<p id="id2.id2" class="ltx_p">We evaluate FL on two representative threat detection tasks, namely SMS spam detection and Android malware detection. It shows that FL-trained detection models can achieve a performance that is comparable to centrally trained counterparts. Also, most non-IID data distributions have either minor or negligible impact on the model performance, while a label-based non-IID distribution of a high extent can incur non-negligible fluctuation and delay in FL training. Then, under a realistic threat model, FL turns out to be adversary-resistant to attacks of both data poisoning and model poisoning. Particularly, the attacking impact of a practical data poisoning attack is no more than 0.14% loss in model accuracy. Regarding FL efficiency, a bootstrapping strategy turns out to be effective to mitigate the training delay as observed in label-based non-IID scenarios.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Machine learning especially deep learning has been increasingly adopted in the cyber security domain, along with good performance achieved in various cyber threat detection tasks, e.g., malware detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, spam filtering <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, malicious network traffic detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. However, the power of machine learning is hindered by several security-specific critical factors. First of all, it is becoming more and more challenging for security vendors to collect individual-relevant and privacy-sensitive threat datasets (e.g., SMS spam/non-spam messages, and dynamic runtime logs of Android apps), which are essential for building up robust and up-to-date machine learning models. This is partly due to the enforcement of various regulations on data protection and privacy, such as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. These regulations aim to enhance individuals’ control and rights over their personal data, along with more limitations enforced for data controllers and processors including security vendors. Then, following these privacy regulations, computing platforms (e.g., Android and iOS) have updated their developer policies along with more restrictions on collecting and uploading on-device data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. What makes things even worse is that the robustness of cyber threat detection models largely relies on the freshness of the training dataset. This is because of the issue of concept drift <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, i.e., the aging of the detection models as the attackers keep evolving their malicious payloads to escape from the detection radar. Also, the inability of collecting up-to-date threat data has already led to degraded performance for some critical security detection tasks, e.g., SMS spam filtering <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Another factor resides in the curse of isolated data islands. A typical security vendor will usually devote much effort to collecting cyber threat data from various sources, and regular organizations (e.g., governments) can also observe cyber threats during their security operation, such as DDoS attacks targeting their network infrastructure or spam emails targeting their employees.
In many cases, sharing such threat data across organizations can help build up a more capable threat detection model. However, the curse of isolated data islands is there, as such threat incidents, especially ones observed during security operations could contain sensitive information relevant to either the involved organizations or individuals. Sharing such threat data will likely incur non-negligible risks for the involved parties (e.g., compromising an organization’s reputation or business interests).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To address these obstacles, we explore in this study the (in)feasibility of federated learning for privacy-preserving cyber threat detection, which, to the best of our knowledge, is among the first-of-its-kind works (see §<a href="#S2" title="II Background and Related Works ‣ Enabling Privacy-Preserving Cyber Threat Detection with Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a> for more discussion).
Federated learning (FL), as a distributed learning paradigm, has been well explored in multiple privacy-sensitive domains, e.g., medical imaging understanding <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> and the next-word prediction task in virtual keyboards <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. In a nutshell, FL allows distributed clients (data owners) to collaboratively train a machine learning model without revealing their local datasets to any parties. Despite achieving promising performance results in some privacy-sensitive machine learning tasks, FL is also known to be vulnerable to adversarial machine learning attacks, especially poisoning attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Therefore, this study focuses on the following research questions.
First of all, <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">how effective can FL be when applied to cyber threat detection tasks?</span> In another word, compared to centrally-trained counterparts, what performance can FL-trained threat detection models achieve, especially in security-specific realistic settings? Then, compared to non-security prediction models, the FL training process for threat detection models can be subject to more adversarial attacks, i.e., various poisoning attacks. Therefore, the secondary research question is <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">how adversary-resistant the FL training process can be when evaluated under a realistic threat model.</span> In addition to effectiveness and adversarial resistance, one more research question we aim to understand is that <span id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">how (in)efficient the FL training process can be when applied to cyber threat detection tasks</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To pursue aforementioned research questions, We have encountered and addressed several challenges. Firstly, we need to decide what threat detection tasks to target. A qualified task should satisfy the following three criteria: 1) It should be a well-known and representative threat detection task; 2) It involves privacy-sensitive scenarios, e.g., collecting data from end users; 3) It may gain benefits through adopting FL. Following these criteria, SMS spam detection and Android malware detection, two binary classification tasks, are chosen, for which, detailed explanations will be given in §<a href="#S3" title="III Security Classification Tasks ‣ Enabling Privacy-Preserving Cyber Threat Detection with Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>.
Briefly, the SMS spam detection task requires collection of privacy-sensitive SMS spam/non-spam messages, which can thus benefit from FL. On the other hand,
many Android malware detection techniques rely on dynamic features that are extracted from runtime logs of Android apps. Such runtime logs are critical but
costly to collect on the server, but are abundant on end-user devices. However, similar to SMS messages, collecting app runtime logs from end-user devices is privacy-sensitive.
Then, given the threat detection tasks, one more issue we encountered is that either the datasets or the classification algorithms evaluated in previous works are outdated. For instance, when training and evaluating the proposed SMS spam detection models, most previous studies used only the UCI SMS spam dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> which was published more than 10 years ago and contains only hundreds of SMS spam messages. Also, although transformer-based language models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many NLP tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, previous works in SMS spam detection failed to consider such kinds of latest machine learning advancements. On the other hand, most studies in Android malware detection differ in their evaluation datasets, which impedes a direct and objective comparison among these studies. Therefore, we addressed this issue through collecting up-to-date and large-scaled threat datasets as well as considering the latest progress in machine learning when building up threat detection models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.3" class="ltx_p">Given threat datasets and machine learning algorithms decided, the third challenge stands out as what FL experiments to conduct so as to evaluate FL in a realistic and security-specific manner. To achieve this goal, multiple novel experiments have been designed and implemented, which take security-specific scenarios and realistic threat models into consideration. Particularly, we observe that FL clients in threat detection tasks tend to follow various non-IID data distributions.
For instance, FL clients in the SMS spam detection task can vary a lot in terms of the natural languages of their local SMS messages, while the Android malware detection task may involve a non-IID distribution in terms of malware families across FL clients. Besides,
different from non-security prediction tasks, FL clients in threat detection tasks may consistently have samples of one class outweigh samples of the other class, e.g., all FL clients have much more benign SMS messages than spam messages. We name this scenario as <span id="S1.p5.3.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">the consistent label imbalance (CLI)</span> scenario. Therefore, when evaluating the effectiveness of FL, we focus on various non-IID distributions of the threat samples across FL clients, rather than exhaustively exploring FL hyperparameters. Also, when evaluating the adversary resistance of FL, we define a realistic threat model and dedicate our evaluations to practical adversary settings, e.g., the fraction of compromised FL clients <math id="S1.p5.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="M" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p5.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.cmml">M</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p5.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1">𝑀</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p5.1.m1.1c">M</annotation></semantics></math> is considered as practical only when <math id="S1.p5.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="M\leq 5\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p5.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S1.p5.2.m2.1.1" xref="S1.p5.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S1.p5.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S1.p5.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">M</mi><mo id="S1.p5.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S1.p5.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">≤</mo><mrow id="S1.p5.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S1.p5.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml"><mn id="S1.p5.2.m2.1.1.3.2" xref="S1.p5.2.m2.1.1.3.2.cmml">5</mn><mo id="S1.p5.2.m2.1.1.3.1" xref="S1.p5.2.m2.1.1.3.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p5.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S1.p5.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p5.2.m2.1.1"><leq id="S1.p5.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p5.2.m2.1.1.1"></leq><ci id="S1.p5.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S1.p5.2.m2.1.1.2">𝑀</ci><apply id="S1.p5.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S1.p5.2.m2.1.1.3"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S1.p5.2.m2.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S1.p5.2.m2.1.1.3.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S1.p5.2.m2.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S1.p5.2.m2.1.1.3.2">5</cn></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p5.2.m2.1c">M\leq 5\%</annotation></semantics></math> for data poisoning and <math id="S1.p5.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="M\leq 1\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p5.3.m3.1a"><mrow id="S1.p5.3.m3.1.1" xref="S1.p5.3.m3.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S1.p5.3.m3.1.1.2" xref="S1.p5.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml">M</mi><mo id="S1.p5.3.m3.1.1.1" xref="S1.p5.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml">≤</mo><mrow id="S1.p5.3.m3.1.1.3" xref="S1.p5.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml"><mn id="S1.p5.3.m3.1.1.3.2" xref="S1.p5.3.m3.1.1.3.2.cmml">1</mn><mo id="S1.p5.3.m3.1.1.3.1" xref="S1.p5.3.m3.1.1.3.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p5.3.m3.1b"><apply id="S1.p5.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p5.3.m3.1.1"><leq id="S1.p5.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p5.3.m3.1.1.1"></leq><ci id="S1.p5.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S1.p5.3.m3.1.1.2">𝑀</ci><apply id="S1.p5.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S1.p5.3.m3.1.1.3"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S1.p5.3.m3.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S1.p5.3.m3.1.1.3.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S1.p5.3.m3.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S1.p5.3.m3.1.1.3.2">1</cn></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p5.3.m3.1c">M\leq 1\%</annotation></semantics></math> for model poisoning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Next, we highlight some key observations and findings as distilled from our FL experiments.
First, regarding the effectiveness of FL, we found that cyber threat detection models trained via FL can achieve a performance that is comparable to that of their centrally trained counterparts. For instance, the spam detection model trained via cross-device FL has achieved a recall of 99.03% and a precision of 99.05% , while it is 98.79% and 99.23% respectively for the centrally trained counterpart. Then, in realistic FL deployments, there can be various non-IID data distributions across FL clients. And our evaluations show that non-IID data distributions can lead to high instability during the convergence of the FL training process, while the impact on the model performance is either negligible or minor. Particularly, a high degree of quantity-based non-IID distribution can even yield better model performance and faster training convergence, while a high degree of label-based non-IID distribution has no obvious impact on model performance but can incur notable fluctuations (i.e., unstable convergence) in FL training, especially for the cross-device FL. Then, when it comes to the consistent label imbalance scenario that is specific to cyber threat detection tasks, we observed that CLI towards positive (malicious) samples can incur a non-negligible degradation in performance, while the performance impact of CLI towards negative samples (more practical in cross-device FL) is minor.</p>

Furthermore, the minor performance impact of practical model poisoning can be addressed through the deployment of robust aggregation rules (e.g., Trimmed Mean <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> and Multi-Krum <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>). For instance, Trimmed Mean has decreased the attack impact of model poisoning on SMS spam detection to almost zero (0.09%). Then, regarding the efficiency of FL, we found out that non-IID data distributions can incur a significant delay in convergence, to address which, a bootstrapping strategy has been proposed with its effectiveness well demonstrated (§<a href="#S7" title="VII The Efficiency of FL ‣ Enabling Privacy-Preserving Cyber Threat Detection with Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VII</span></a>).</p>

On one hand, we have systematically evaluated the effectiveness, byzantine resilience, and efficiency of FL for two representative cyber threat detection tasks, which features security-specific and realistic FL experiments.

In recent years, FL has been explored in multiple privacy-sensitive areas <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, e.g., next-word prediction and medical image segmentation.
Particularly, Hard et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> applied FL to the training of a next-word prediction model that is used in a mobile virtual keyboard. Upon real-world but privacy-sensitive keyboard input data distributed across mobile devices, the FL-enabled next-word prediction model has achieved better performance than the centrally trained counterpart. Besides, FL has also been demonstrated in the task of semantic segmentation of medical image <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, which enables cross-institution model training without sharing the medical images of patients.</p>

Spam denotes unsolicited messages that are delivered to victims through various channels, such as the short message service (SMS) and the Email services. Varied by the delivery channel and the message format, spam messages can thus be grouped as SMS spam, Email spam, among others. In this study, we focus on the SMS spam detection considering the following factors. Particularly, it is privacy-invasive to collect SMS messages, regardless of spam or not spam, not to mention uploading SMS messages to the central server for model training and evaluation, which partially explains the scarcity of publicly available SMS spam/non-spam datasets. Besides, SMS messages are short in their length, and the underlying SMS spam campaigns keep evolving across time with more stealthy evasion techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, rendering existing detection systems decay in their performance.

Malware detection aims to decide whether a given software program is malicious or not, and optionally attribute a malicious program (malware) to relevant malware families. Serving as a key threat detection task, malware detection plays an important role in protecting end users and end devices.
As malware programs on different operating systems can have significantly differentiated syntactic and malicious behaviors, the malware detection problem can be further divided into Android malware detection, Windows malware detection, and iOS malware detection, among others.
In this study, we choose Android malware detection as the 2nd threat detection task due to several factors elaborated below. Firstly, Android, as an open mobile operating system, has been widely adopted by billions of mobile users, which gives rise to a large client base for FL-enforced malware detection.
Also, alike SMS spam detection, Android malware detection also suffers from the scarcity and outdatedness of publicly available datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>, <a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite>. Besides, as malware intelligence is an important intellectual property, it is impractical for security vendors to directly share their proprietary malware datasets. Instead, collaborative learning via FL appears to be promising, which will be comprehensively evaluated in this study.</p>

These systems differ in many aspects, especially how detection features are extracted, what machine learning algorithms have been adopted, as well as how the detection system is evaluated and what groundtruth datasets have been applied to the evaluation.
Particularly, McLaughlin et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> abstracted an Android app as a sequence of opcodes and utilized an embedding layer to automatically embed the opcode sequence into a fixed-size feature vector, while Gao et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>]</cite> considered an Android app as a node in a graph and utilizes node embedding techniques to auto-encode an Android app. Also, various classification algorithms have been explored, e.g., random forest <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite>, SVM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">63</a>]</cite>, CNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">63</a>, <a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>, <a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>]</cite>, LSTM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">63</a>]</cite>, and graph neural networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>, <a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>]</cite>.

In 2023, a dynamic weighted federated averaging (DW-FedAvg) strategy was applied to Android malware detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib68" title="" class="ltx_ref">68</a>]</cite>. Besides, Fereidooni, et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib69" title="" class="ltx_ref">69</a>]</cite> applied the concept of cross-silo FL to threat intelligence sharing across organizations. Still, very few settings were considered when profiling the effectiveness of FL, and no experiments were conducted to understand the adversarial resistance of FL.</p>

<p id="S2.p14.1" class="ltx_p">Moving forward from these works, when evaluating the effectiveness of FL for cyber threat detection tasks, we have comprehensively considered various non-IID settings and consistent label imbalance scenarios. Furthermore, we have profiled, for the first time, the adversarial resistance of FL, in practical threat settings and for cyber threat detection tasks. Lastly, we have highlighted a set of efficiency issues for FL-based cyber threat detection along with promising solutions proposed and demonstrated.</p>

The first is the UCI SMS spam dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> which was released in 2012 and consists of only 747 SMS spam messages and 4,827 non-spam messages. To enable an up-to-date evaluation of SMS spam detection, two more recent datasets were further collected, namely, ExAIS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> and SpamHunter <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. In total, these three datasets have contributed 26,346 SMS spam messages and 7,717 SMS non-spam messages which are featured by 75 different natural languages and over 12 diverse spam categories <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, to facilitate solid performance evaluation, we moved to make this dataset balanced. Specifically, we randomly sampled tweets from the Twitter archive <span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>https://archive.org/details/twitterarchive</span></span></span> to complement the non-spam SMS messages, which is based upon the assumption that most posts published on Twitter are benign. This assumption is aligned with observations in previous studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib70" title="" class="ltx_ref">70</a>, <a href="#bib.bib71" title="" class="ltx_ref">71</a>]</cite>. Also, we manually labeled 1,000 sampled tweets and confirmed that 97% of them are benign. In total, we have got a balanced dataset of 52,692 spam/non-spam messages. And we name this dataset as <span id="S3.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Spam-2022</span>.</p>

One is the CNN model as proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, while the other is a pre-trained transformer-based language model, namely, the multilingual BERT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> which has achieved SOTA performance in many NLP tasks  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. Note that the original CNN model supports only English text as input and SMS messages in other languages should be translated into English in advance. Also, the CNN model has only 7 million parameters, which is much smaller than the multilingual BERT model of 167 million parameters.</p>

<p id="S3.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S3.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">The model performance.</span> Given the largest-ever SMS spam groundtruth dataset (Spam-2022), two SMS spam detection models have been trained and tuned with different hyper-parameters explored.
During model training, 80% of the spam groundtruth were randomly sampled out for training and validation, while the left 20% were used for testing.
Table <a href="#S3.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ III Security Classification Tasks ‣ Enabling Privacy-Preserving Cyber Threat Detection with Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a> lists a direct comparison between the CNN model and the BERT model with regards to their spam detection performance. As we can see, the BERT model outperforms the CNN model by 1.76% in recall and by 0.90% in F1 score. Considering the better performance as well as the multilingual support, the BERT model was chosen as the baseline model in our FL experiments for SMS spam detection.</p>

Although benign Android apps can be easily collected, it is not the case for their realistic runtime logs, e.g., the api call sequence and network traffic flows. Such dynamic features are critical but costly to collect. However, end-user devices have app logs that are both realistic and abundant, but also privacy-sensitive, which renders a good fit for cross-device FL.</p>

For the malware samples, all were collected from the Drebin dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, one of the most commonly used malware dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>, <a href="#bib.bib72" title="" class="ltx_ref">72</a>]</cite>.
Specifically, the Drebin dataset contains 5560 malware samples that belong to 179 different malware categories and families. After excluding files with decompiling failures or files with size smaller than 5KB, 4255 were selected out as the malware samples in our groundtruth.
Since Drebin doesn’t contain benign Android apps, the benign samples were composed from two sources. One is CIC-AndMal2017 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib73" title="" class="ltx_ref">73</a>]</cite> and the other is Androzoo <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib74" title="" class="ltx_ref">74</a>]</cite>. Benign samples in the CIC-AndMal2017 were apps published in Google Play between 2015 and 2017. To guarantee the variety and obtain new samples, we also downloaded some other benign samples published in 2020 from Androzoo.
For all benign samples, we queried VirusTotal <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib75" title="" class="ltx_ref">75</a>]</cite> regarding their maliciousness and have thus confirmed there are no virus alerts for each of the selected benign samples.</p>

<p id="S4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Then, a security-specific non-IID scenario is also designed and evaluated. Specifically, in our cross-device FL for spam detection, clients (i.e., real-world end devices, especially mobile devices) tend to consistently have more non-spam samples than spam ones in their local datasets, whereas organization participants in the cross-silo FL are likely to have lots of spam messages but much fewer non-spam ones due to the privacy regulations. This gives rise to a scenario that is different from traditional non-IID data distributions, and we call it <span id="S4.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">the consistent label imbalance</span> (CLI) wherein most (if not all) clients consistently have samples of one class outweighing samples of another class.
This CLI scenario is also applicable to malware detection, especially for the cross-device FL wherein the participating Android end devices are likely to have more benign apps installed than the malware ones.
However, this may not be the case for the cross-silo malware detection as the participating anti-virus vendors are likely to have balanced datasets.</p>

<p id="S4.p6.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Experiments to evaluate FL byzantine resilience.</span> Since the FL clients can be byzantine or even malicious especially in the cross-device FL, the 2nd group of experiments aim to evaluate the byzantine resilience (adversary resistance) of FL in security prediction tasks. To achieve this, we first evaluated a representative data poisoning attack, namely label flipping <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>, under different ratios of compromised clients. Also, previous works typically assume the attacker can poison all samples on a client or even generate a poisoned dataset that is much larger than those of benign clients, however, we argue that this is not realistic. This is because most attackers typically have no direct control over a large volume of FL clients, but can only remotely distribute poisoned data samples to FL clients, which means they can only poison a portion instead of all of the local samples. For instance, in the SMS spam detection scenario, attackers may distribute stealthy but true spam messages to some FL clients, and these messages may escape the device owner’s annotation and be considered as non-spam during FL training. However, in the meantime, the attacker cannot prevent the same FL client from receiving SMS messages (spam or non-spam) from other sources as well as assigning true labels to these messages. The only chance that an attacker can fully poison a client is when they have full control of the respective client, in which case model poisoning is a better option rather than data poisoning. Also it can be easily detected by the server if an unusually large set of poisoned samples is used by the attacker. Therefore, stepping forward from previous studies, we evaluated different poisoning rates, i.e., the fraction of local samples being poisoned, and we assume that the size of the poisoned dataset is similar to that of a regular dataset of a benign FL client.</p>

<div id="S4.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Then, when some participating FL clients are fully controlled by the attackers, model poisoning attacks become possible, in addition to data poisoning attacks.

Among the left ones without such a dependency, three are selected for our experiments, which include LIE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, MIN-SUM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>, and MIN-MAX <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>.</p>

We choose to evaluate untargeted poisoning rather than targeted or backdoor poisoning because untargeted poisoning is more challenging and has higher adversarial impact on realistic FL security applications. We have also evaluated the defensive effectiveness of two representative robust AGRs including Trimmed Mean <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> and Multi-Krum <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.

Particularly, it is extensible enough to allow us to customize the FL training process and experiment with different realistic settings such as the presence of model poisoning attacks and the deployment of robust aggregation rules (AGRs). Besides, it is agnostic to the underlying machine learning frameworks, which facilitates the migration of centrally trained security prediction models to the FL scenario.</p>

Some of these FL hyper parameters are learned from common practices of previous FL works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib80" title="" class="ltx_ref">80</a>, <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>, e.g., the number of clients in cross-device FL and cross-silo FL, and the aggregation rule, while others are distilled from our preliminary FL experiments, e.g., the client-side learning rate, the number of client-side epochs, etc.
Also, FL training with these default hyper-parameters has achieved a performance comparable to that of centralized training, for both security classification tasks under our study. One thing to note is that the best hyper parameter setting varies across security classification tasks, and identifying such a setting is not our focus, but can be easily achieved by the central FL server in real-world deployments.</p>

We can see that the FL baseline models, no matter whether cross-device FL or cross-silo FL, have achieved a performance that is comparable to their centrally trained counterparts. For instance, the spam detection model trained via cross-device FL has achieved a recall of 99.03% and a precision of 99.05% , while it is 98.79% and 99.23% respectively for the centrally trained counterpart.</p>

In addition, the number of rounds needed to converge varies across security detection tasks. For instance, in cross-device FL training, the SMS spam detection task converges more quickly with less than 100 rounds while it is over 200 rounds for Android malware detection.</p>

Such performance variance is also illustrated in Figure <a href="#S5.F2.sf1" title="In Figure 2 ‣ V The Effectiveness of FL ‣ Enabling Privacy-Preserving Cyber Threat Detection with Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2(a)</span></a>.</p>

<div id="S5.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p8.1" class="ltx_p">As presented in Figure <a href="#S5.F2.sf2" title="In Figure 2 ‣ V The Effectiveness of FL ‣ Enabling Privacy-Preserving Cyber Threat Detection with Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2(b)</span></a>, another benefit of a higher extent of quantity-based non-IID is the fewer number of rounds it takes to converge in FL training. Here, a patience of 10 is configured for spam and 3 for malware, when determining whether the training converges.
Given such a benefit of quantity-based non-IID, one possible explanation is that a higher level of quantity-based non-IID leads to a greater variance in the local data size of the FL clients. Consequently, it allows some FL clients to train better local models more quickly. The aggregation of such early but better local model updates leads to faster convergence and better performance.
However, one exception is the SMS spam detection model trained through cross-silo FL, where the performance variance among different <math id="S5.p8.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\alpha" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p8.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S5.p8.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.p8.1.m1.1.1.cmml">α</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p8.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S5.p8.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p8.1.m1.1.1">𝛼</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p8.1.m1.1c">\alpha</annotation></semantics></math> does not exceed 0.001. Our explanation is that the average client-side SMS data size of each client selected in cross-silo FL is ten times larger than that in cross-device FL. As a result, regardless of the level of the quantity-based non-IID, the client-side SMS datasets in cross-silo FL are sufficiently large to generate a global model that can quickly converge with good performance.
In a nutshell, it can be concluded that in practical scenarios, a higher level of quantity-based non-IID distribution may actually lead to better performance and faster convergence, especially for cross-device FL. However, on contrary, label-based non-IID can incur extra delay in convergence as well as making the training process unstable, as detailed below.</p>

As we can see, this phenomenon is especially obvious for cross-device FL, as further illustrated in Figure <a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ V The Effectiveness of FL ‣ Enabling Privacy-Preserving Cyber Threat Detection with Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.
We conclude that the label-based non-IID distribution can cause non-negligible instability (fluctuations) for the FL convergence process, especially for cross-device FL involving a large number of clients. Also, another side effect of label-based non-IID is the delay in convergence, which will be further elaborated in §<a href="#S7" title="VII The Efficiency of FL ‣ Enabling Privacy-Preserving Cyber Threat Detection with Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VII</span></a>.</p>

Specifically, there exists an imbalanced distribution of malware families across FL clients, especially in the scenario of cross-device FL. To profile its potential impact on FL training, we conducted experiments following a setting that is similar to that of aforementioned language-based non-IID experiments. Here, we have 133 distinct malware families. Considering cross-silo FL only has 20 clients in total, in order not to miss out too much families, each cross-silo client needs to select at least <math id="S5.p17.1.m1.2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\{k:k&gt;4\}" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p17.1.m1.2a"><mrow id="S5.p17.1.m1.2.2.1" xref="S5.p17.1.m1.2.2.2.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S5.p17.1.m1.2.2.1.2" xref="S5.p17.1.m1.2.2.2.1.cmml">{</mo><mi id="S5.p17.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.p17.1.m1.1.1.cmml">k</mi><mo lspace="0.278em" rspace="0.278em" id="S5.p17.1.m1.2.2.1.3" xref="S5.p17.1.m1.2.2.2.1.cmml">:</mo><mrow id="S5.p17.1.m1.2.2.1.1" xref="S5.p17.1.m1.2.2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.p17.1.m1.2.2.1.1.2" xref="S5.p17.1.m1.2.2.1.1.2.cmml">k</mi><mo id="S5.p17.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1" xref="S5.p17.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1.cmml">&gt;</mo><mn id="S5.p17.1.m1.2.2.1.1.3" xref="S5.p17.1.m1.2.2.1.1.3.cmml">4</mn></mrow><mo stretchy="false" id="S5.p17.1.m1.2.2.1.4" xref="S5.p17.1.m1.2.2.2.1.cmml">}</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p17.1.m1.2b"><apply id="S5.p17.1.m1.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S5.p17.1.m1.2.2.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S5.p17.1.m1.2.2.2.1.cmml" xref="S5.p17.1.m1.2.2.1.2">conditional-set</csymbol><ci id="S5.p17.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p17.1.m1.1.1">𝑘</ci><apply id="S5.p17.1.m1.2.2.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p17.1.m1.2.2.1.1"><gt id="S5.p17.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p17.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1"></gt><ci id="S5.p17.1.m1.2.2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.p17.1.m1.2.2.1.1.2">𝑘</ci><cn type="integer" id="S5.p17.1.m1.2.2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.p17.1.m1.2.2.1.1.3">4</cn></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p17.1.m1.2c">\{k:k&gt;4\}</annotation></semantics></math> families.

<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">The threat model.</span> When selecting data/model poisoning attacks and evaluating their attack impact, we consider a realistic threat model. Specifically, for both data poisoning and model poisoning, we assume that
the attacker has whitebox knowledge of the global model (its parameters, architecture, and output), as this knowledge can be easily inferred from either the model updates or the local training process. However, the attacker has no knowledge of the aggregation rule that is enforced by the central server, so any attacks that rely on such knowledge are considered as impractical and are outside the scope of our evaluation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p3.3" class="ltx_p">Also, for both cross-device FL and cross-silo FL, the attackers should have no access to benign FL clients, regardless of data poisoning or model poisoning.
Besides, we assume that data poisoning attacks don’t involve any effective collusion among poisoned clients as the attackers of data poisoning either have no direct access to the poisoned FL clients or the access is too limited to allow effective collusion. Instead, a model poisoning attacker in the cross-device FL should have compromised one or more FL clients and these compromised FL clients can collude with each other during the FL training process.
Note that such a model poisoning attack is considered only possible for the cross-device FL but not the cross-silo FL, as the participants of the cross-silo FL are assumed to be trusted organizations under contracts and their FL servers should be well protected.

<p id="S6.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To summarize, we consider untargeted FL poisoning attacks and the attackers have whitebox knowledge of the global model, but no knowledge of the server-side aggregation rule. Then, a practical data poisoning attack is equipped with very limited access to the poisoned FL clients, and thus does not involve cross-client collusion during FL training, whereas a practical model poisoning attack has full access of the poisoned FL clients to enable cross-client collusion, but is only feasible for the cross-device FL.</p>

<p id="S6.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Across these algorithms, we assume the attackers have no access to benign FL clients (and their updates), but full access to the original benign updates of the compromised FL clients.
In a nutshell, the LIE attack adds to each dimension of the model updates of the compromised clients, a perturbation that is small enough to not be detected and pruned as outliers by robust AGRs. Unlike LIE, MIN-MAX and MIN-SUM formulate the perturbation generation as an optimization problem wherein the resulting malicious model update is upper bounded by its distance to benign updates of compromised FL clients. Particularly, In MIN-MAX, the distance of the resulting malicious model update to any benign updates is upper bounded by the maximum distance between any pair of benign updates, whereas MIN-SUM requires the sum of squared distance between the malicious update and all benign updates should be no more than that of all pairs of benign updates.

One exception resides in the attacks using MIN-MAX and MIN-SUM against the spam detection model, which have achieved a loss in accuracy by 1.52% and 1.30% respectively, which is still minor and thus acceptable, considering the extra benefits of FL.

As some practical model poisoning attacks have resulted in a minor performance degradation for the SMS spam detection task, we further explored the effect of robust AGRs on defending against such model poisoning attacks. Particularly, two robust AGRs (Trimmed Mean and Multi-Krum) were selected under our experiments. As shown in Table <a href="#S6.T17" title="TABLE XVII ‣ VI-B Model Poisoning Attacks ‣ VI The Byzantine Resilience of FL ‣ Enabling Privacy-Preserving Cyber Threat Detection with Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">XVII</span></a>, both Trimmed Mean and Multi-krum work well in terms of decreasing the attack impact. Particularly, Trimmed Mean has decreased the attack impact of MIN-MAX from 1.31% to 0.14% while the attack impact of MIN-SUM has decreased from 1.07% to 0.09%.</p>

As revealed by our byzantine resilience evaluation, robust AGRs can help mitigate attacks of both model poisoning and data poisoning to some extent in cross-device FL. However, it is unclear whether such a benefit makes it worth to enable robust AGRs by default in a routine FL training process, since model poisoning attacks may not always be present but efficiency matters a lot in FL training. We thus moved to profile the overheads of aforementioned two robust AGRs along with a direct comparison with FedAVG under the default FL settings. Table <a href="#S7.T18" title="TABLE XVIII ‣ VII The Efficiency of FL ‣ Enabling Privacy-Preserving Cyber Threat Detection with Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">XVIII</span></a> presents the accuracy stats of the resulting models and we can see enabling robust AGRs have a minor performance impact.</p>

<div id="S7.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p4.1" class="ltx_p">We then looked into the training processes and compared different AGRs with regards to the training time and the number of convergence rounds. We ran each settings for three times and obtained the average.

When compared with FedAVG, it increased the number of cross-device FL training rounds by 118.18% and 22.58% for SMS spam detection and Android malware detection respectively. Similarly, the time cost also increased by 95.61% and 18.73%. On the other hand, the overheads of Multi-Krum appear to be minor across the two security prediction tasks. For SMS spam detection, Multi-Krum has increased the time of cross-device FL training by only 21.58% while barely increasing the rounds needed to converge. However, for Android malware detection, it has made the training process more efficient along with fewer training rounds and training time. A likely explanation is that our SMS spam detection model is much larger than the Android malware detection model, and the large-volume parameters can make it costly to calculate Euclidean distance between model updates, which however is necessary in Multi-Krum when selecting out qualified model updates. Based on these results, we conclude that Multi-Krum can be enabled by default in cross-device FL training so as to defend possible poisoning attacks while incurring few or even no overheads, especially when the model under training is of a small size.</p>

In addition to trying the default FL setting of 200 clients, we also tested a setting with 500 clients. The convergence process is shown in Figure <a href="#S7.F11" title="Figure 11 ‣ VII The Efficiency of FL ‣ Enabling Privacy-Preserving Cyber Threat Detection with Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a>, along with a comparison to their respective non-bootstrapped counterparts. We can see that the bootstrapping settings have effectively improved not only the convergence speed but also the stability in label-based non-IID scenarios.
These results suggest the effectiveness of using bootstrapping in FL to speed up and stabilize the convergence of FL training, especially for extreme non-IID data distributions.</p>

<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S8.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Limitations and Future works.</span> In this study, we focus on evaluating the feasibility of FL for two representative and privacy-sensitive security prediction tasks, with regards to effectiveness, byzantine robustness, and efficiency. As discussed above, security tasks can still vary to a notable extent in their resilience to byzantine clients and extreme non-IID data distribution. Therefore, it is worth further evaluating more representative security prediction tasks in FL scenarios, so as to identify the case-by-case deployment strategies customized for each given security prediction task.
On the other hand, cyber threat detection tasks can share many common properties, e.g., the threat model, the behavior patterns of the attacker, etc. We thus believe our findings and observations can likely be generalized to tasks sharing similar properties, e.g., the detection of Email/Tweet spam, and classification of malware of other platforms.</p>
</div>
<div id="S8.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, for both tasks of SMS spam classification and Android malware detection, we composed historical datasets from multiple sources, due to the unavailability of a threat dataset that is both up-to-date and balanced. However, as these historical datasets are either out-of-dated or imbalanced, the composed dataset may still have a different data distribution when compared with the real-world and up-to-date data. However, this issue appears to be unavoidable and its impact on our FL evaluations may deserve further investigation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S8.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Besides, when evaluating the byzantine resilience, we focus on untargeted poisoning attacks since it is more challenging and can be more destructive when compared with targeted poisoning attacks. However, targeted poisoning attacks may still occur for FL-based security prediction tasks and we leave it as our future works to further explore the byzantine resilience of FL against targeted poisoning attacks.
Then, when it comes to the efficiency of FL, we focus on the computational aspect, and leave it as a future work to evaluate the communication efficiency of FL-based security prediction tasks, especially in realistic deployment settings.</p>

<div id="S9.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S9.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we have extensively explored the feasibility of applying federated learning to cyber threat detection tasks. Our evaluations have demonstrated that FL is both effective and byzantine-resilient when applied to representative threat detection tasks, and its efficiency issues can be well addressed through a bootstrapping strategy. To conclude, FL is a promising option for enabling privacy-preserving cyber threat detection.
