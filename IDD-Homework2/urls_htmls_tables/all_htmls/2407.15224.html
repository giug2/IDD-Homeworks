<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Training and deploying Machine Learning models that simultaneously adhere to principles of fairness and privacy while ensuring good utility poses a significant challenge. The interplay between these three factors of trustworthiness is frequently underestimated and remains insufficiently explored. Consequently, many efforts focus on ensuring only two of these factors, neglecting one in the process. The decentralization of the datasets and the variations in distributions among the clients exacerbate the complexity of achieving this ethical trade-off in the context of Federated Learning (FL).
For the first time in FL literature, we address these three factors of trustworthiness.
We introduce PUFFLE, a high-level parameterised approach that can help in the exploration of the balance between utility, privacy, and fairness in FL scenarios. We prove that PUFFLE can be effective across diverse datasets, models, and data distributions, reducing the model unfairness up to 75%, with a maximum reduction in the utility of 17% in the worst-case scenario, while maintaining strict privacy guarantees during the FL training.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) models have been deployed in a wide variety of fields. In earlier years, the emphasis was primarily on optimizing the utility of these models. Nowadays, the current and upcoming AI legislation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> demand equal attention to other trustworthiness requirements <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, including but not limited to fairness and privacy. Fairness refers to the goal of reducing the algorithmic biases that models might exhibit in their predictions and/or representations. Privacy refers to the goal of keeping training data safe and preventing any information leakage through the use of the model. Although privacy and fairness are ideally sought at the same time, it is unfortunately challenging to find a balance between them <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.
Often, the outcome is a model exhibiting strong utility, measured in model accuracy, but deficient in terms of privacy protection and fairness.
Conversely, efforts to address the model’s unfairness may compromise privacy protection and utility requirements.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">This problem becomes even more complex to solve when we consider a Federated Learning (FL) scenario. With FL, various clients aim to train a model without transferring their local training data to a central server. Instead, they only exchange the locally trained model with a central aggregator. The decentralization of the training datasets introduces several issues that do not need to be considered when working in a centralized learning context.
In this paper, we investigate the interplay between privacy, fairness, and utility within the context of FL, and present a methodology that enables informed decisions on the ethical trade-offs with the goal of training models that can strike a balance between these three dimensions.</p>

We propose PUFFLE, a first-of-its-kind methodology for finding an optimal trade-off between privacy, utility and fairness while training an FL model. Our approach, inspired by the method in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite> for a centralised setting, aims to train a model that can satisfy specific fairness and privacy requirements through the active contribution of each client. In particular, the clients incorporate an additional regularization term into the local loss function during the model’s training to reduce unfairness. Furthermore, to ensure the privacy of the model, each client employs Differential Privacy (DP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> by introducing controlled noise during the training process. We summarize our key contributions below:</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Training a single model that achieves fairness and privacy objectives is always a challenging task <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> because of the incompatibility in the simultaneous use of these trustworthiness requirements. Several papers have demonstrated how using privacy mitigation techniques could lead to more unfair models w.r.t. the underrepresented groups <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. Similarly, employing fairness mitigation techniques can increase the privacy risk for involved clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">There is a large body of research on techniques to mitigate the unfairness of models trained in centralised learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>. One idea, initially proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> with a logistic regression model, is the use of a dedicated regularization term. Recently, Yaghhini et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite> extended this method to train models that could be both private and fair. They modified the standard Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, which is itself a variant of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). In their work, they introduced two methods: FairDP-SGD and FairPATE. The goal is to train “impartial” ML models that do not favour one goal over another. They recover a Pareto Frontier to show the trade-off between the different objectives. The method in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite> has been the primary inspiration for our work. However, in our setting, data decentralization requires managing the presence of many clients with different distributions, preventing a direct application of the method in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite>. Moreover, the variety of fairness definitions leads to different mitigation strategies to achieve different goals.</p>

<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In FL, the literature firstly focused on fostering <span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Accuracy parity</span>, i.e., achieving consistent model performance across clients regardless of their data distribution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, then on mitigating <span id="S2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Group Fairness</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, i.e., achieving consistent model performance across different demographic groups represented in the dataset. Current literature on FL often addresses privacy and fairness as separate constraints, rather than considering them jointly <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
Recently, some works have started to consider the interplay between these two requirements. Borja Rodríguez-Gálvez et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> introduced the Fair and Private Federated Learning (FPFL) algorithm to enforce group fairness in FL. The algorithm extends the modified method of differential multipliers to empirical risk minimization with fairness constraints and uses DP to guarantee privacy protection. However, a limitation is that clients can only perform a single local step before sharing the model with the server, increasing communication costs and slowing down the training. Our solution relies on a more advanced FL aggregation algorithm, allowing multiple local steps before model sharing, thus reducing communication costs.</p>

<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">A two-step approach proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> tackles this problem training a fair model that balances fairness and utility. Then, a second model with DP guarantees aligns its predictions with the fair predictions of the first one. However, focusing exclusively on scenarios with few clients overlooks potential issues with multiple clients involved in training. Instead, our solution also works as clients increase addressing problems that may occur. A similar solution has been proposed in  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>.
First, the clients train a fair proxy model and then a privacy-protected model based on the proxy. However, this approach shares similar limitations to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>. Additionally, its applicability is restricted to scenarios involving convex and Lipschitz loss functions. Furthermore, a few crucial details regarding privacy accounting mechanisms are missing, making it challenging to evaluate the privacy guarantees.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">A different family of solutions to mitigate the model unfairness consists of making the model fair either in a pre-or a post-processing phase. Sikha Pentyala et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> introduced a pre-processing and a post-processing algorithm to reduce the unfairness in FL while preserving the client’s privacy by adopting DP during the training. Abay et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> presented a similar approach using a pre-processing method to mitigate the model unfairness. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of these methods allow the user to set a desired unfairness level that the model should exhibit at the end of the training.

In FL, <span id="S3.SS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Group Fairness</span> can be assessed either by aggregating results at the individual client level or at the server, where client prediction statistics are aggregated.

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our proposed methodology aims to incorporate DP and a fairness regularization term into the training process of an FL model. The goal is twofold: to mitigate the privacy risks encountered by clients involved in the model training, and concurrently, to diminish the algorithmic biases of the model increasing its fairness. Being in an FL setting, we cannot directly apply the techniques utilized in centralized learning. The decentralization of data introduces several challenges that must be considered and addressed when implementing a solution like the one we propose. Our final goal is to offer an easy-to-use approach to train fair and private FL models that can balance fairness, privacy and utility meeting pre-defined trustworthiness requirements. We tested our approach on multiple datasets, proving that it can be effective regardless of the data modality, distribution, and model architecture.

<p id="S4.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In addition to managing edge cases, client-shared statistics play a crucial role in understanding the trained model’s disparity. A global view of the model fairness involves aggregating the various counters from individual clients, allowing for the computation of demographic disparity as if the server had access to the entire dataset. Conversely, the opposite approach involves gaining a local understanding of demographic disparity by computing the mean of each client’s demographic disparity. This dual approach enables a global view across the entire dataset and a focused client fairness examination.</p>

While DP-SGD maintains the same theoretical time complexity as standard SGD, it is important to note that it is practically slower due to the explicit per-sample gradient computation requirement.
The computation of the fairness loss in PUFFLE does not introduce additional computational overhead. This is because the fairness loss calculation uses predictions already available from the training process.</p>

For CelebA, we use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) consisting of three convolutional layers (CL) with 8, 16, and 32 channels, respectively. We use kernel size of value 3 and the stride parameter with value 1. Each CL is followed by max pooling with kernel size 2 and stride value of 2. After the CL, we use a fully connected layer with 2048 hidden units, with ReLU as the activation function. For Dutch and ACS Income, instead, we use a simple neural network with a single linear layer to mimic the behaviour of a Logistic Regressor.
We used Flower <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> to simulate the FL process and developed the neural networks using PyTorch <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>.</p>

In the case of the ACS Income dataset, we leverage the natural division of this dataset into states using each of the 51 states as a client during the training. We add more information about the strategy used to split the dataset into clients in Appendix <a href="#A3" title="Appendix C Data Distribution ‣ PUFFLE: Balancing Privacy, Utility, and Fairness in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">C</span></a>.</p>

On each FL round, we sample 30% of the training clients with CelebA and Dutch while we select half of the training clients in the case of ACS Income Dataset.

To ensure consistency throughout the hyperparameter search, we kept the set of test clients constant. On the contrary, we shuffled the assignment of clients to the training and validation sets for each of the different hyperparameter searches ran. For the Dutch and CelebA dataset, we used 150 clients: 50 as test clients, while the remaining 100 were split into 60% training and 40% validation clients. With ACS Income dataset, we had 51 clients in total: 11 used as test, 30 as train and 10 as validation. After completing the hyperparameter tuning, we retrained the model using the best hyperparameters, combining training and validation clients into a single training group.</p>

However, our experiments empirically show that we can achieve test disparity close to our fairness target under diverse settings. Results presented here are the averages and standard errors of 5 executions per experiment. Each execution is conducted with a different seed for shuffling training clients, while test clients remain constant. For brevity, only results with 25%, 50% and 75% reduction in disparity are shown; other privacy and target disparity combinations can be found in Appendix <a href="#A4" title="Appendix D Results with other datasets ‣ PUFFLE: Balancing Privacy, Utility, and Fairness in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">D</span></a>.</p>

Compared with the Baseline, PUFFLE reduces model disparity by at least 75%, with an accuracy degradation of only 21% in the worst-case scenario with Dutch, and 1.4% with ACS Income.

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The changes in AI legislations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> are pushing the development and deployment of ML models that can respect trustworthiness factors such as privacy and fairness. This paper has explored the relatively unexplored interplay between these factors and the utility of models in the context of FL. PUFFLE, our high-level parameterised methodology, enables clients to make informed decisions by expressing fairness, privacy, and utility preferences. This is crucial for models that must comply with AI regulations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As one of the first explorations in studying the relationship between utility, fairness and privacy in the context of FL, our work opens up many possibilities for future research. A limitation that our methodology currently has is that it is not able to handle the unfairness of clients who have a bias toward different sensitive groups, e.g., half of the clients unfair toward the group of “Female” while the other half toward the group of “Male”. Thus, we think an extension of the methodology to handle scenarios where clients have biases toward different groups is needed. In addition, our future efforts aim to explore the use of alternative fairness metrics for regularization. We used the Demographic Disparity but there exists a lot of fairness metrics that could be used instead. This would make our system even more customized and suitable for use in many contexts. Another interesting problem that we did not consider in PUFFLE is how to balance these three trustworthiness requirements when the clients involved in the training have different requirements in terms of fairness or privacy.
Our contribution represents a significant step toward developing FL models capable of ensuring high accuracy, the privacy of the clients, and fairness to underrepresented groups.</p>

<div id="A5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have addressed the problem of designing a <span id="A5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">trustworthy</span> machine learning process in a decentralized, federated learning setting. Our approach provides by design an acceptable trade-off between privacy, fairness and accuracy of the learned model.
The scope of this research is to provide technological grounds and solutions for the development of ethical, lawful and trustworthy artificial intelligence compliant with regulations related to privacy protection, such as the EU GDPR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>, and to Artificial Intelligence, such as the upcoming EU AI Act <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="A5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">AI systems based on machine learning models trained by exploiting our methodology demonstrated efficacy in avoiding the negative impact of learning biases from data. This work may therefore benefit underrepresented groups such as ethnic and gender minorities avoiding their algorithmic discrimination.</p>
</div>
<div id="A5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, our approach enables the opportunity for humans to set both desired privacy and fairness requirements. As a consequence, in case data used for training the models contain sensitive information, the potential leakage of such information is mitigated through both the distributed setting that minimizes the sharing of data and the privacy mitigation strategy which ensures the confidentiality of any shared information.</p>
</div>
<div id="A5.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">This work is the result of a collaboration of researchers with expertise ranging from privacy in big data and machine learning to responsible AI. This blending of expertise has allowed us to better understand the intricate landscape of AI ethics, considering not only the technical nuances but also the social implications. The presence of researchers with a mathematical background allowed us to apply differential privacy in our methodology in a rigorous way.</p>
