<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In cellular federated edge learning (FEEL), multiple edge devices holding local data jointly train a neural network by communicating learning updates with an access point without exchanging their data samples. With very limited communication resources, it is beneficial to schedule the most informative local learning updates. In this paper, a novel scheduling policy is proposed to exploit both diversity in multiuser channels and diversity in the “importance” of the edge devices’ learning updates. First, a new probabilistic scheduling framework is developed to yield unbiased update aggregation in FEEL. The importance of a local learning update is measured by its gradient divergence. If one edge device is scheduled in each communication round, the scheduling policy is derived in closed form to achieve the optimal trade-off between channel quality and update importance. The probabilistic scheduling framework is then extended to allow scheduling multiple edge devices in each communication round. Numerical results obtained using popular models and learning datasets demonstrate that the proposed scheduling policy can achieve faster model convergence and higher learning accuracy than conventional scheduling policies that only exploit a single type of diversity.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As driven by the phenomenal growth in global mobile data traffic, <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">artifical intelligence</span> (AI) has revolutionized almost every branch of science and technology ranging from computer vision, natural language processing, to wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. The implementation of AI in wireless networks is foreseen as an innovative breakthrough for realizing an intelligent network. To enable rapid access to the large amount of real-time data generated by massive distributed edge devices, a new paradigm of computing, called <span id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">edge learning</span> has emerged by migrating learning from central clouds towards the edge of wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Despite the proximity to data source in edge learning, it still faces with a critical challenge of privacy concern when transmitting raw data to the edge server. To overcome this deficiency, an innovative framework namely <span id="S1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">federated edge learning</span> (FEEL) has been proposed, which features distributed learning at edge devices and update aggregation at the edge server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. By periodically reporting the local learning updates to the edge server for global aggregation, FEEL is capable of leveraging the heterogeneous data to attain an accurate learning model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A major design objective in FEEL is to accelerate the training process and maintain certain learning accuracy under communication and computation resource constraints. Due to that communication suffers from impairment of wireless channels (e.g., channel fading, interference, and noise), it is often the main bottleneck for fast FEEL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. This fact calls for effective scheduling algorithms for <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">fast update acquisition</span> from highly distributed edge devices. Conventional scheduling principles focus on data rate <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> or quality-of-service <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> whereas assume that the transmitted data is equally important. However, this assumption is often inappropriate in FEEL since different local learning updates are of dissimilar significance to the model convergence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. This motivates researchers to design a new scheduling approach based on not only the channel states but also how important the local updates are for learning. Towards this end, we consider the scheduling problem in FEEL by jointly exploiting the diversity involved in both wireless channels and local learning updates.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Communication-efficient FEEL requires the joint design of learning algorithms and communication techniques. Recent years have seen much research interests from both industry and academia, covering key topics such as learning update compression <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, radio resource management <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, and over-the-air computation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. Specifically, the authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> proposed two update compression approaches based on random sparsification and probabilistic quantization to reduce the communication cost between edge server and edge devices. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, a sparse ternary compression framework was developed to adapt to the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) FEEL environment, which compresses the upstream and downstream via sparsification, ternarization, error accumulation, and Golomb encoding. Moreover, the deep gradient compression technology was employed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, where a hierarchical threshold selection policy was proposed to speed up the gradient sparsification process. On the other hand, the authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> developed an efficient control algorithm to achieve the trade-off between local update and global aggregation during the learning process with limited communication resource budget. Further, a joint user selection and resource allocation policy towards minimizing the FEEL loss function was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> by taking into account the packet error over wireless links.
In addition, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> presented an effective client scheduling and resource allocation policy for FEEL over wireless links with imperfect channel state information (CSI), and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> proposed a joint user selection and resource allocation policy to minimize the FEEL convergence time based on probabilistic scheduling.
Besides, the trade-off between learning time and energy consumption in FEEL was investigated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, where <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> developed a closed-form communication and computation resource allocation in a synchronous manner, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> designed an iterative algorithm for joint power control and resource allocation. In particular, a novel technique namely <span id="S1.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">over-the-air computation</span> is adopted for update aggregation in FEEL. Based on this, the authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> considered joint device selection and beamforming design in FEEL. Moreover, a prominent broadband analog aggregation multiple-access scheme featuring the aggregation of analog modulated gradients was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, where two communication-and-learning trade-offs were highlighted as well. To facilitate implementation,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> was further extended in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, which designed a digital broadband over-the-air aggregation scheme to evaluate the effect of wireless channel impairment on model convergence.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, the local learning updates in FEEL are not equally important for model convergence and thus are valuable to be exploited for further performance improvement <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. Some prior works incorporated the new feature of data importance for communication design in centralized edge learning systems, such as data retransmission <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> and user scheduling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. Specifically, a pioneering importance-aware automatic-repeat-request protocol was designed to balance the communication reliability and the data uncertainty <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, the authors also proposed an importance-aware user scheduling scheme to improve the communication efficiency in edge learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. Inspired by this, we consider to exploit the update importance for scheduling design in FEEL, which has not been well studied in existing works.</p>

<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a novel importance- and channel-aware scheduling policy to improve the performance of FEEL. This work is most related to the prominent FEEL works of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> in analyzing convergence behaviour using classical scheduling policies and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> in combining channel state and update norm for scheduling. However, the scheduling policy in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> is not specifically designed for FEEL while the convergence analysis is not provided in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. We go one further step than <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> in that we provide fundamental convergence analysis as well as develop an innovative scheduling for FEEL.
Our main result demonstrates that the scheduling decision should elegantly balance the diversity in wireless channels and learning updates to achieve a satisfactory learning performance.

To leverage the rich data over edge devices while preserving data privacy, all devices adopt the federated learning technique by iteratively reporting their locally computed gradient for global aggregation in lieu of raw data. Due to the gradient sparsity, the communication overhead can be significantly reduced by some gradient compression approaches. Therefore, we focus on the gradient-averaging implementation in the subsequent exposition.
Moreover, only a small subset of devices can be chosen for every global gradient aggregation because of the limitations in communication resources. To coordinate all edge devices, a scheduler is implemented at the edge server, which performs device selection and resource allocation.

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As discussed earlier, the main objective of the FEEL system is to minimize the training time for attaining a desired learning accuracy. According to the federated learning mechanism, we can observe that the training time is determined by two factors, i.e., the one-round latency and the model variation in each round. Both factors are affected by the scheduling decision, making device scheduling a key problem. Specifically, the former mainly depends on the channel fading due to that the communication latency dominates the computation latency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. The latter is primarily decided by the selected local gradients based on the update equation (<a href="#S2.E8" title="In 6th item ‣ II-D Learning Mechanism ‣ II System Model and Learning Mechanism ‣ Scheduling for Cellular Federated Edge Learning with Importance and Channel Awareness" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>). Since both factors are important, they should be balanced for joint scheduling design, leading to two types of multiuser diversity to be exploited in such a system. One is the independent fading in multiuser channels, namely <span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">multiuser channel diversity</span>, while the other is the heterogeneous importance levels across multiuser local gradients, namely <span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">multiuser update diversity</span>.
Targeting active gradient acquisition in FEEL, we should simultaneously exploit the multiuser diversity in wireless channels and local gradients, called <span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">channel-and-update diversity</span> to improve the learning performance.</p>

<p id="S3.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Thus far, the multiuser channel and update diversity have been evaluated by the one-round latency and the gradient divergence, respectively. Targeting training acceleration, it is desirable to schedule the device with the best channel state as well as the smallest gradient divergence. However, this case rarely occurs in practice, resulting in a trade-off between gradient divergence and one-round latency.

The data unbalanced indicator reflects the data size proportion of each local dataset in the global dataset. Therefore, a larger data unbalanced indicator implies that the local gradient contains more data information such that it can contribute more to the model convergence. On the other hand, it is desirable to schedule the device with a larger gradient norm as it includes more non-zero elements and can further promote the model update.
Moreover, the result suggests us to assign a small probability to the device with bad channel state. Also, scheduling a device with bad channel state will incur straggler issue, which should be avoided in the scheduling design.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">From Theorem 1, we can observe that the importance level of each local gradient is well characterized by two scalars: its gradient norm and local dataset size. Moreover, both scalars can be easily derived at local devices while transmitting them to the scheduler will not incur excessive delay. This result drives us to use the product of these two scalars as the gradient importance measurement. On the other hand, the scheduler is able to evaluate each local gradient upload latency via dynamical channel state estimation. Towards this end, both channel and update diversity can be jointly exploited for practical scheduling design.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">This standard assumption is satisfied by many popular learning models, such as the least-squared SVM and the linear regression in Table I. In Section VI, we will conduct experiments to demonstrate that our analytical results also work well for some popular loss functions which do not satisfy this assumption. Then, by applying the result of Theorem 1 into Lemma 2, we can derive the convergence upper bound of each communication round, as shown in the following theorem. The detailed proof is presented in Appendix C.</p>

For the SVM model, we choose two typical classes of “airplane” and “automobile” in the well-known dataset CIFAR-10 for classification, where each device owns 330 data samples in one class. For the CNN model, we use the popular MNIST dataset that consists of 10 categories ranging from digit “0” to “9” and a total of 60,000 labeled training data samples. We first sort all data samples by their digit labels, divide them into 60 shards of size 1,000, and then assign each device with two shards. By this means, each device obtains the data samples with only two types of digits, making the data distribution over devices a pathological non-IID manner.

It is because that the learning updates of different devices play a similar role in model convergence at the beginning of the training process, making channel state the dominant factor for learning performance improvement. Nevertheless, the proposed policy can outperform the channel-aware scheduling as the training proceeds. The underlaying reason is that the gain by exploiting channel diversity is saturated such that the improvement primarily comes from the update diversity. In particular, the channel-aware scheduling suffers from a visible performance degradation after achieving an accuracy peak. As we can imagine, part of devices with poor communication channels cannot participate in the training process when scheduling decision merely depends on the channel state. This inevitably incurs the data deficiency and will result in overfitting issue. On the other hand, the proposed policy always outperforms the importance-aware scheduling policy since it well balances the channel state and update importance in the training duration. Last, we can find that the weight coefficient <math id="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\rho" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">ρ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1">𝜌</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1c">\rho</annotation></semantics></math> has a great impact on model convergence.

Therefore, the proposed policy can save more than half time to achieve the target accuracy comparing against the importance-aware scheduling.

In contrast, the channel-aware scheduling is incapable of achieving the target accuracy due to the lack of data information from the devices with poor channel conditions. In particular, the performance gap between the channel-aware scheduling and importance- and channel-aware scheduling is more evident than that in the SVM model. It attributes to the fact that the update diversity in the multiclass classification scenario is larger than that in the binary classification scenario. These observations further demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheduling policy to deal with the non-IID data in distributed FEEL system.</p>

It can be observed from all plots that the proposed policy achieves the fastest convergence speed along with the highest learning accuracy throughout the entire training duration. This result is rather intuitive since the channel-aware scheduling overlooks the update importance whereas the importance-aware scheduling is unconscious of the channel condition. It also confirms the applicability of the proposed sequential scheduling without replacement algorithm, even though it cannot guarantee the optimal device scheduling. On the other hand, the performance improvement in this strategy is more conspicuous than that in the strategy of scheduling one device in each communication round, which substantiates the theoretical gain brought by the intelligent trade-off between quality and quantity in update aggregation.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have proposed a new importance- and channel-aware scheduling policy for update aggregation in FEEL. We have developed a probabilistic scheduling framework to guarantee the unbiasedness of the aggregated global gradient as well as to speed up convergence. An optimal scheduling policy has been designed to incorporate the channel state and update importance for decision making. We have also provided the concrete convergence analysis. Moreover, the probabilistic scheduling framework has been extended to the strategy of scheduling multiple devices in each communication round and some practical implementation issues have been highlighted as well. Comprehensive experiments using real datasets substantiate the performance gain of the proposed scheduling policy as compared with the benchmark policies.</p>
