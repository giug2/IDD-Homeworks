<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Buildings account for 40 % of global energy consumption. A considerable portion of building energy consumption stems from heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), and thus implementing smart, energy-efficient HVAC systems has the potential to significantly impact the course of climate change. In recent years, model-free reinforcement learning algorithms have been increasingly assessed for this purpose due to their ability to learn and adapt purely from experience. They have been shown to outperform classical controllers in terms of energy cost and consumption, as well as thermal comfort. However, their weakness lies in their relatively poor data efficiency, requiring long periods of training to reach acceptable policies, making them inapplicable to real-world controllers directly. Hence, common research goals are to improve the learning speed, as well as to improve their ability to generalize, in order to facilitate transfer learning to unseen building environments.</p>
<p id="id2.id2" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we take a federated learning approach to training the reinforcement learning controller of an HVAC system. A global control policy is learned by aggregating local policies trained on multiple data centers located in different climate zones. The goal of the policy is to simultaneously minimize energy consumption and maximize thermal comfort. The federated optimization strategy indirectly increases both the rate at which experience data is collected and the variation in the data. We demonstrate through experimental evaluation that these effects lead to a faster learning speed, as well as greater generalization capabilities in the federated policy compared to any individually trained policy. Furthermore, the learning stability is significantly improved, with the learning process and performance of the federated policy being less sensitive to the choice of parameters and the inherent randomness of reinforcement learning. We perform a thorough set of experiments, evaluating three different optimizers for local policy training, as well as three different federated learning algorithms.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One of the greater challenges of modern society is that of climate change. Efforts to mitigate climate change must focus not only on the supply side of energy, e.g., renewable and nuclear energy, but also on the demand side, considering factors such as energy consumption and efficiency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Fawzy et al., <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. Of the global energy consumption, buildings alone are responsible for roughly 40 % of the total consumption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Biemann et al., <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. Heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) are major factors in building energy consumption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Fawzy et al., <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, and hence, developing smart and energy-efficient HVAC control systems can play an important role in mitigating climate change.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Most of the current HVAC systems in residential buildings are managed by classical algorithms, such as rule-based controllers and proportional, integral and derivative controllers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Biemann et al., <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. These controllers not only lack knowledge of the thermal dynamics of the building environment but are also unable to take weather predictions into account. Hence, they are unable to react and adapt to changes in the environment, leading to sub-optimal energy performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wang and Hong, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. To utilize predictive data and knowledge of the building environment for improved building control performance, one can rely on Model Predictive Control (MPC) techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wang and Hong, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. MPC can anticipate when to, e.g., preheat a building based on weather and occupant forecasts, in order to improve energy efficiency. MPC has been shown to be effective at reducing energy consumption on both simulated and real building environments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wang and Hong, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. However, a serious drawback to MPC is that it requires accurate models of the environment in which the controller operates. On the other hand, every building is unique and, as such, developing a general MPC-based energy management system that can be deployed to various buildings is extremely difficult, and MPC is yet to be adopted by the building industry on a wider scale <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wang and Hong, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, through the emergence and rapid development of deep learning, it has become increasingly popular to apply machine learning techniques in multiple different research fields <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Perera and Kamalaruban, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. Reinforcement learning, a sub-field of machine learning concerned with control problems, has also started to gain considerable interest in research on energy system applications, including HVAC control systems. In particular, model-free reinforcement learning algorithms provide a promising direction for building control. As the name suggests, these algorithms do not require any model of the building environment or of its dynamics within. Instead, they learn purely from data collected while interacting with the environment. This eliminates the need for expert domain knowledge to develop models of the environment and allows the algorithms to be applied to any building in general, which are the main challenges of developing and deploying MPC-based controllers. Reinforcement learning algorithms also have greater adaptability to changes in the environment, as they can learn from the environment indefinitely, and as such, they can take into account long-term changes, such as changes in climate and occupant behaviour.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Reinforcement learning has been successfully applied for building-related control tasks, though mostly in simulated environments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wang and Hong, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. A major hurdle for the deployment of reinforcement learning algorithms to real buildings is their poor data efficiency. They need to collect large amounts of experience data to learn decision policies that take reasonable actions, and thus, it takes a long time to train them. For example, soft actor-critic, a state-of-the-art algorithm with best-performant data efficiency and learning speed requires more than a year of training to produce an acceptable policy in terms of thermal comfort <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Biemann et al., <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. Currently, this data inefficiency makes it infeasible to train reinforcement learning algorithms directly in physical building environments. A promising approach to overcome this data efficiency is to use transfer learning, i.e., to pre-train a controller on a simulated environment and then move it to a real environment for fine tuning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wang and Hong, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. Still, it is not known how to generalize a controller trained on a small set of buildings for use in another building not seen during training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wang and Hong, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In an effort to address both the issues of data efficiency and generalization, we explore the employment of federated learning as a learning scheme for a smart HVAC system. Federated learning is a paradigm for decentralized distributed machine learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al., <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>. A shared global model is trained on data distributed locally over a network of participating nodes by sending copies of the global model to the nodes, training the copies on the local data, and sending the local updates back to a central server for model aggregation. The local data of each node is never explicitly shared with other nodes, nor with the central server. This reduces the communication costs associated with transmitting data and eliminates the need for large storage capacity at the coordinating central server, while simultaneously ensuring a higher degree of data privacy at the nodes. Federated learning also makes no assumptions about the distribution of the data, and thus it can be applied to systems with heterogeneous components. These features make federated learning an ideal distributed learning scheme for smart HVAC system controllers, since every building will have its own unique data distribution, and sensitive information, e.g., occupancy behaviour, will be kept private. By training a controller on multiple buildings simultaneously, we effectively collect the total experience data at a higher rate than any single building, which counteracts the low data efficiency of reinforcement learning algorithms. Also, since the data distribution is heterogeneous, the collected experience data varies from building to building, leading the total experience to be more diverse, thereby facilitating greater generalization capabilities in the shared controller.</p>

<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of federated learning for training reinforcement learning-based HVAC controllers.

The objective of the controller is to minimize energy consumption while maintaining thermal comfort, i.e., keeping the temperature within a user-specified (deemed acceptable) range of values. We evaluate and compare the performance of three different optimizers on the local nodes: <span id="S1.p6.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">stochastic gradient descent</span>, <span id="S1.p6.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">stochastic gradient descent with momentum</span>, and <span id="S1.p6.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Adam</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kingma and Ba, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite>. The performance of the federated controller with the best local optimizer is then compared to that of individual controllers trained exclusively on each respective data center. Furthermore, we evaluate two additional federated learning algorithms: <span id="S1.p6.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Federated Averaging with server momentum</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Hsu et al., <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> and <span id="S1.p6.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedAdam</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Reddi et al., <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>.

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Some of the first applications of reinforcement learning to the control of HVAC systems were made around the turn of the millennium. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Anderson et al. (<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1997</a>)</cite> combined a proportional plus integral (PI) controller with a reinforcement learning component to control a heating coil. They evaluated it in a simulated environment, showing improved performance compared to the PI controller alone. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Mozer (<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">1998</a>)</cite> utilized reinforcement learning in the control of the HVAC, Domestic Hot Water (DHW) and lighting systems of a real house, with the objective of minimizing both electricity cost and occupant discomfort. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Henze and Schoenmann (<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2003</a>)</cite>, the authors investigated a reinforcement learning solution for the operation of a simulated thermal storage system to reduce energy costs, showing favorable results when compared to conventional controllers. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Liu and Henze (<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2005</a>)</cite> used Q-learning to train both passive and active thermal storage controllers for reduced energy costs. They found the performance to be sensitive to the learning parameters and the sizes of the state and action spaces. The training time was also observed to be unacceptably long for real-world applications. They followed up their research with a hybrid learning approach in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Liu and Henze (<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2006a</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">b</a>)</cite>, where the agent is first pre-trained in a simulation of the environment, after which it is applied to and further trained on the true environment, making it an early example of transfer learning. They found the approach to significantly reduce the training time needed in the true environment. However, this approach requires an accurate model of the environment for the simulation phase, therefore having the same drawback as MPC.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The last decade has seen an increase in research on reinforcement learning in the energy domain, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Vázquez-Canteli and Nagy, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Perera and Kamalaruban, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Sun et al. (<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>)</cite> minimized the day-ahead energy costs using an event-based approach, where the reinforcement learning agent takes actions only “as needed”, instead of in regular time intervals. This reduces computational requirements while maintaining similar performance in cost savings and human comfort compared to time-based approaches. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Barrett and Linder (<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite> reduced the cost of energy while meeting the temperature set-point specified by the user during periods of occupancy. They employ a Bayesian learning approach to predict occupancy and a Q-learning agent to control the thermostat unit. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Li and Xia (<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite> trained a Q-learning agent to simultaneously minimize energy consumption and maximize thermal comfort. They improve upon the learning speed of standard Q-learning by utilizing a multi-grid approach, where the discretization of the state and action spaces are highly coarse at the beginning for early convergence, after which both spaces are iteratively refined during training for more fine control of the HVAC system. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Ruelens et al. (<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite> minimized the energy costs of thermostatically controlled loads in both a dynamic pricing and day-ahead scheduling scenario using a Fitted Q-iteration controller equipped with a backup controller to ensure comfort. The controller converges much faster than standard Q-learning, and yields significant cost savings compared to the default controller, though increasing the energy consumption. A similar approach was taken by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Costanzo et al. (<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Wei et al. (<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> minimized the energy costs and thermal comfort violations of a multi-zone building using a Deep Q-network (DQN), which achieves comparable levels of comfort violations while yielding greater cost savings than standard Q-learning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The papers reviewed thus far focus on value-based reinforcement learning, in most cases Q-learning. Their limitations lie in that they must discretize the state and actions spaces, and scale poorly in terms of computation and memory to both the increase in dimension of the space and the granularity of the features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wiering and Van Otterlo, <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>; Kochenderfer et al., <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. Hence, in practice, the discretization is often coarse. HVAC control tasks are often naturally formulated as continuous control problems. Modeling the control task with value-based methods can therefore lead to oversimplification, since the rough discretization of state and action spaces sacrifices finer control. In contrast, policy gradient and actor-critic algorithms learn continuous policy functions and, as such, can provide more suitable alternatives.</p>

DDPG is shown to outperform the value-based Q-learning, SARSA and DQN algorithms in terms of energy consumption and thermal comfort. A similar comparison and conclusion was made between DDPG and DQN in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Du et al.

In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Chen et al. (<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, PPO was used to reduce energy consumption while maintaining thermal comfort. The control policy was pre-trained on historical data of the existing controller using imitation learning. Thus, the policy learns to emulate the existing controller, performing reasonably well already at deployment, and quickly improving through fine-tuning with the PPO algorithm. The performance was evaluated in both simulated environments and a real conference room. The pre-trained PPO controller managed to reduce the cooling demand in the real environment, making the approach reasonable for real-world deployment, assuming the existence of historical controller data.</p>

<div id="S2.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Model-based reinforcement learning approaches have also been explored, albeit the role the model plays varies. For example, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Gao and Wang (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>, a model of the environment was learned through function approximation. The learned model is used to generate additional simulated experience in conjunction with the real experience, leading to faster convergence of the reinforcement learning algorithm. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Nagy et al. (<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> also learned a model of the environment, but instead used the model to plan the actions multiple steps ahead. While model-based approaches demonstrate greater sample efficiency than model-free algorithms, leading them to learn significantly faster, their success depends on how accurate the model is. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Nagy et al. (<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>, their model-based algorithm converges in only about 20 days, while simultaneously outperforming the model-free approach in terms of both consumption and comfort. However, they showed that if the learned model is incorrect or if the dynamics of the environment change, the algorithm fails to adapt and is in turn outperformed by the model-free algorithm. As with MPC-based approaches, the main drawback of model-based approaches is that they require accurate models to achieve successful performance. As the dynamics of different buildings vary greatly and are difficult to model, developing model-based control systems that can be deployed generally is a challenging task.</p>

They evaluate two different scenarios. In their power-saving scenario, the temperature setting of the AC is fixed, and the task of the agent is to turn the AC on when people are present in a room and off when the room is empty. In the second, normal operation scenario, the agent also aims to control the charging and discharging of a storage battery, with the goal of maintaining the temperature below a threshold. The agent is able to perform in the power-saving scenario, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Fujita et al.

<p id="S2.SS5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our survey suggests that, while there has been effort dedicated to the employment of reinforcement learning for controlling HVAC systems with a degree of success, there is a lack of focus on investigating whether federated learning can be used to address some of the challenges faced by these studies, such as data efficiency and generalization. This is precisely where our contribution lies. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to thoroughly evaluate the effects federated optimization has on the learning and performance of reinforcement learning agents for direct control of HVAC systems.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is a framework for learning a shared global model on decentralized data across multiple nodes, without the nodes sharing their private data. Unlike typical distributed learning, federated learning makes no assumptions about the data distribution across nodes being <span id="S3.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">independent and identically distributed</span> (IID), and so it can be applied to non-IID settings as well. Furthermore, federated learning can also handle unbalanced data, i.e., some nodes having significantly larger local data sets than others. These characteristics allow federated learning to take advantage of massive amounts of data spread out over a large, heterogeneous network, e.g., pictures taken and stored on mobile phones, to learn a global model that generalizes well, while never communicating the local data itself. This maintains a higher degree of privacy across nodes while simultaneously eliminating the need for a central data center capable of storing the entire global data set.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is well-suited for smart HVAC system controllers due to its ability to accommodate the unique data distribution of each building and maintain the privacy of potentially sensitive information such as occupancy behavior. By training a controller across multiple buildings at once, we indirectly gather experience data more efficiently compared to training on a single building, which helps overcome the data efficiency limitations of reinforcement learning algorithms. Additionally, the heterogeneous data distribution results in more diverse experience data from different buildings, enhancing the generalization capabilities of the controller agent.</p>

The idea of gradient masking is to apply a soft mask to the server update, which assigns higher importance to the components of the pseudo-gradients which are in agreement with the dominant direction, thereby better capturing the invariances across clients. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Hagström (<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> gradient masking was found to improve the stability of the learning process by reducing the randomness across different seeds.

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Sinergym provides 12 different weather profiles from significantly different climates. Each profile is fixed and provides hourly weather observations over a one-year period. The training of our agents spans multiple years, and so we do not wish to use the same weather profile for every year of training since we cannot know if the agent learns a useful policy for variable weather or if it simply overfits the weather profile. Thankfully, Sinergym allows us to add stochasticity to the weather from year to year. In <a href="#A3" title="Appendix C Weather Profiles ‣ Employing Federated Learning for Training Autonomous HVAC Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">C</span></a> we provide further details and the full list of the weather profiles considered in table <a href="#A3.T5" title="Table 5 ‣ Appendix C Weather Profiles ‣ Employing Federated Learning for Training Autonomous HVAC Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We perform two main sets of experiments. In the first set, we train a federated HVAC control agent using FedAvg as the server optimizer. We evaluate the performance of three different client optimizers: SGD, SGD with momentum (SGDM), and Adam. We have 12 available weather profiles, and so we train on 11 client data centers, each with its own unique weather conditions. The Helsinki weather profile is reserved for evaluating the performance of the global agent in unseen environments. We also train individual agents for each client and include their performance as a baseline. In the second set of experiments, we evaluate two alternative federated algorithms, FedAvgM and FedAdam, using the best-performing client-side configuration from the first set.</p>

The training runs over a period of 15 years. The simulator takes a step in the environment, i.e., sends observations to the agent and executes the actions chosen by the agent, every 15 minutes, and so a full training run consists of a total of 525 600 environment interactions.

In figure <a href="#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 4.3.1 Evaluation results ‣ 4.3 Results ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Employing Federated Learning for Training Autonomous HVAC Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, we show the progression of the energy consumption and comfort violation of the FedAvg agents on the evaluation environment for all client optimizers. The agents are evaluated for three episodes at the end of each episode of training. We plot the mean values over the three episodes over all random seeds with their bootstrapped 95 % confidence intervals. Based on the progression plots, we notice that FedAvg with Adam does not only offer improved generalisation compared to the others. It also displays faster learning speeds, with the energy consumption converging after about five episodes and the comfort violations converging after just three episodes, while SGD converges in roughly eight episodes, and SGDM has not converged yet at the end of training. FedAvg with Adam has better learning stability as well. The tighter confidence intervals with regards to both energy consumption and comfort violation indicate that the learning is more robust to randomness in the model initialization and training process, and thus its performance is more reliable.</p>

We also notice a high variance in the energy consumption, both across different clients as well as across different runs for each client, with a significant outlier in the agent trained in the Antananarivo environment. Remarkably, the variance for the federated agent is significantly lower.

<p id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">These observations support our conclusion that using federated optimization to train an HVAC control agent can significantly improve generalization, with a better performance in an unseen environment than any independently trained agent. Federated training can also improve the learning speed, generally converging faster, as well as learning stability, displaying a significant reduction in the variance in performance over different random seeds. In any real-world application, this consistency is a highly desirable trait, since we are not able to train the agent multiple times and therefore need a model that can reliably learn a good policy despite the inherent randomness of the real environment and training.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We have seen that applying federated optimization can improve the performance of a reinforcement learning HVAC control agent in an unseen environment. Thankfully, this does not come at the expense of poorer performance in the training environments. In figure <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 4.3.2 Training results ‣ 4.3 Results ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Employing Federated Learning for Training Autonomous HVAC Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, we present the evolution of energy consumption and comfort violation of the federated agent and independent agents in the training environments. We only plot a subset of the environments for the sake of legibility. The behaviour of the omitted environments is consistent with the ones shown and analysed in this section. For additional figures of the remaining environments, please refer to <a href="#A6" title="Appendix F Additional plots ‣ Employing Federated Learning for Training Autonomous HVAC Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">F</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The energy consumption in figure <a href="#S4.F4.sf1" title="In Figure 4 ‣ 4.3.2 Training results ‣ 4.3 Results ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Employing Federated Learning for Training Autonomous HVAC Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4(a)</span></a> displays similar improvements from using FedAvg in the evaluation environment. FedAvg generally converges faster and manages to reach a lower level of energy consumption. We also see improved learning stability, with slightly less variance across training runs. These improvements are even more pronounced when analysing the progression of comfort violation in figure <a href="#S4.F4.sf2" title="In Figure 4 ‣ 4.3.2 Training results ‣ 4.3 Results ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Employing Federated Learning for Training Autonomous HVAC Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4(b)</span></a>. While the federated agent converges to near-zero comfort violations after two or three episodes, the independent agents never achieve near-zero violations. They also exhibit significantly more variance across both agents and different training runs. This shows that the model does not only benefit from the improved generalization, learning speed and learning stability of federated learning when applied to an unseen environment but also during training itself.</p>

FedAvg has significantly worse comfort violations than FedAvgM and FedAdam in the first episode, but performs better in the second. The opposite is true for the energy consumption. We also notice that FedAvg has tighter confidence intervals, and so offers better learning stability than FedAvgM and FedAdam.</p>

In a real-world scenario, we cannot evaluate multiple different hyperparameters and, as such, it is desirable to use an algorithm with as few adjustable parameters as possible, with minimal sensitivity to said hyperparameters.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have experimentally evaluated the effects of training reinforcement learning HVAC control agents via federated optimization. We have trained Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) agents using Federated Averaging (FedAvg) with gradient masking, evaluating and comparing the performance of three different client optimizers: stochastic gradient descent (SGD), stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDM), and Adam. We have also compared the performance of federated agents to that of individual agents, trained on each respective client environment used in the federated learning scenario, both in terms of their performance in an unseen test environment and their performance in the training environments themselves. Furthermore, two alternative server optimizers, Federated Averaging with server momentum (FedAvgM) and FedAdam, were compared to the FedAvg algorithm.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Through our experiments, we have identified three key improvements from applying federated optimization to training reinforcement learning HVAC controllers. Firstly, by learning from experience collected from multiple heterogeneous environments, the agent gains access, albeit indirectly, to a larger amount of training data, which generally encompasses more variability than that available to any independent agent. In other words, there is an increase in exploration, which leads to a more informed global agent that is able to <span id="S5.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">generalize better</span> to different environments. Secondly, the amount of total experience increases at a faster rate, which leads to an <span id="S5.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">increase in learning speed</span>. Finally, when aggregating over the local agents, the dominant direction in the pseudo-gradient will have the most impact on the global update. This seems to have a regularizing effect, making it more difficult for the agent to branch off into sub-optimal regions of the policy space, <span id="S5.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">increasing the learning stability</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The choice of client optimizer can have a significant impact on the performance. The federated model can benefit from adaptivity on the local optimizer, as we found Adam to perform considerably better than both SGD and SGDM in terms of generalization, learning speed and learning stability. Meanwhile, the choice of server optimizer seems less critical. Both FedAvgM and FedAdam display comparable performance to FedAvg, although FedAvg slightly outperforms them. Moreover, FedAvg also has the advantage of having fewer hyperparameters to be tuned. In a real-world application we cannot run multiple experiments to determine the best choice of parameters, so having fewer moving components is a desirable trait. Since neither FedAvgM nor FedAdam offers any substantial improvements in return for the increased sensitivity to hyperparameter choices, we believe FedAvg to provide a more reliable choice in terms of further deployment efforts in real-world settings.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The training of the federated agent is considerably sensitive to the clients’ learning rate. With lower learning rates, federated optimization offers stable and fast learning, but it is not suitable as-is for a real-world building environment due to the high degree of comfort violations at the beginning of training. By increasing the learning rate, it is possible to significantly reduce the comfort violations early on, but this comes at a trade-off for significantly worse final performance. Future research could be dedicated to bridging this trade-off through, e.g., the use of learning rate schedules, starting with a high learning rate and gradually decreasing it as training progresses. The great generalization of the federated agent provides another promising direction for future research on transfer learning from simulated to real environments, where a pre-trained agent is deployed and tuned on real buildings. Alternatively, the federated agent could also be pre-trained on historical data.</p>

These forecasted values are retrieved from the base weather profile. Since the weather over each year is stochastically modified from the base weather profile, the base weather profile provides us with values that are close to the “true” observed values, much like a typical weather forecast. Hence the base profile gives us a good proxy for a real weather forecast.</p>

<div id="A4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We use the implementation of the SAC algorithm provided by the Stable Baselines3 framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Raffin et al., <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, which offers reliable implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms in PyTorch <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Paszke et al., <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>. The Q-value functions and policy are approximated using simple feed-forward neural networks with an input layer, two hidden layers, and an output layer. As argued by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Biemann et al. (<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, in a real-world application, tuning all the hyperparameters of the algorithms becomes infeasible, hence the algorithms should perform well out-of-the-box. We therefore use the default hyperparameters of the Stable Baselines3 implementation. An exception is the rate at which the policy and Q-networks are updated. We set the training frequency to once every hour, i.e., after every 4 environment steps. At every update, the model takes a number of gradient steps equal to the number of environment steps taken between updates. See table <a href="#A4.T6" title="Table 6 ‣ Appendix D Implementation details ‣ Employing Federated Learning for Training Autonomous HVAC Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> for a list of the exact hyperparameter values used for SAC.</p>

<div id="A4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In deep reinforcement learning and when training neural networks in general, it is often useful to ensure that all the features of the input vectors are on the same scale. This prevents very large features from dominating the calculated gradient, as well as maintains a more consistent range of values for the gradient, which often leads to more stable and faster learning. Hence we normalize the observations. The reward also affects the scale of the gradient, and as such, normalizing the rewards can also have a stabilizing effect. We therefore normalize the rewards as well. We use the VecNormalize wrapper in Stable Baselines3 with default values to normalize using a moving average.</p>

<p id="A4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">SAC learns a stochastic policy. However, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Haarnoja et al. (<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018b</a>)</cite> find that making the final policy deterministic often results in better performance than choosing actions stochastically, and so we set the SAC policy to be deterministic as well during evaluation.
