<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">The rapid growth in Internet of Things (IoT) technology has become an integral part of today’s industries forming the Industrial IoT (IIoT) initiative, where industries are leveraging IoT to improve communication and connectivity via emerging solutions like data analytics and cloud computing. Unfortunately, the rapid use of IoT has made it an attractive target for cybercriminals. Therefore, protecting these systems is of utmost importance. In this paper, we propose a federated transfer learning (FTL) approach to perform IIoT network intrusion detection. As part of the research, we also propose a combinational neural network as the centerpiece for performing FTL. The proposed technique splits IoT data between the client and server devices to generate corresponding models, and the weights of the client models are combined to update the server model. Results showcase high performance for the FTL setup between iterations on both the IIoT clients and the server. Additionally, the proposed FTL setup achieves better overall performance than contemporary machine learning algorithms at performing network intrusion detection.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The Internet of Things (IoT) has become an integral part of our lives as it connects people, things, and processes flawlessly. At a very low cost and with minimal human intervention, the physical world can meet the digital world. Certain instances can include smart watches that use sensors to keep track of your heartbeat rate and footstep count, motion sensor lights that toggle on when you enter or exit a room, or even smart transit systems that can provide passengers with predicted wait times for public transportation. IoT can be an energy-saving resource that promotes automation to help the public. Cisco stated that by the end of 2023, there will be more than three devices connected to the internet for every human on the planet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Industrial IoT (IIoT) is the intersection of information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT). IT utilizes computing devices to process electronic data while OT uses programmable devices that gather environmental information through repeated interactions. IIoT forms an integral part of today’s industrial applications as the physical infrastructures of various industries like agriculture, healthcare, and power, can be monitored using this technology. An illustration of IIoT is provided in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Give and Take: Federated Transfer Learning for Industrial IoT Network Intrusion Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A major challenge to the adoption of IIoT is data security. IIoT consists of a network of interconnected devices. Hence, if a device in the network is compromised, all other devices in the network could be put in jeopardy. Therefore, it is essential to secure the sensitive data of all IIoT devices through measures such as secured data ports, transmission channels, and the network. Kaspersky reported that within the first six months of 2021, 1.5 billion IoT devices had been attacked, an increase of 639 million from the previous year <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. A major hindrance to protecting these networks is the progressively increasing number of users, resulting in the generation of sizable and substantial data. Most of this generated data is private and sensitive, requiring it to be protected from cybercriminals. Unlike traditional IT, where there are considerable cybersecurity tools to protect the data, IIoT data is not protected from cyber attacks by simply using traditional cybersecurity methods.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">With the rise of computational capabilities and faster processing power, the usage of machine learning (ML) for performing IoT network intrusion detection can be a valuable option for protecting IIoT data from being attacked. However, certain limitations are currently present with existing ML-based network intrusion detection systems (NIDS). The first limitation lies in the scarcity of IIoT data. ML algorithms require high performance to be effective as a network security mechanism, which requires tremendous amounts of highly-dimensional data. Unfortunately, many laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) do not allow the collection of data without the consent of data subjects. Collection of IoT device data can be challenging as this data can contain sensitive and private user data. For instance, a personal voice assistant might contain overheard personal information from a user’s conversation. Additionally, another limitation is the willingness to share the data with relevant individuals and organizations. To maintain confidentiality, organizations prohibit the sharing of their data with the outside world. In some organizations, data sharing is restricted to a subset of individuals who work directly with the data and is kept hidden from other employees. To ensure security, certain practices restrict data sharing across international borders. Therefore, finding a data source collected from IIoT devices is a non-trivial task due to the restrictions placed on data-sharing practices by organizations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The second limitation lies with the traditional ML algorithms that have been investigated to create ML-based NIDS for IIoT. Due to the high-dimensional nature of IoT data, existing ML algorithms tend to lose their efficiency. Also, most IoT data is collected from heterogenous sources like water sensors and soil moisture sensors. This can make it difficult to create a comprehensive ML algorithm capable of analyzing the different robust statistics and variances of the data sources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Additionally, developing ML or deep learning (DL) techniques to perform IIoT intrusion detection is challenging as new attack types and vectors are getting discovered frequently. These new attack types are not being effectively detected by existing ML and DL methods and can also require more computation power to operate <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To address the issue of data availability, federated learning (FL) has been seen as an effective mechanism. FL helps to build personalized models for IIoT devices that do not violate user and organizational privacy through novel training methods. In addition, FL provides a privacy protection scheme that utilizes the computing resources of the IIoT device to train the models, thereby preventing information leakage during transmissions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Similarly, to address the limitation of heterogeneous IIoT data sources, transfer learning (TL) can be an effective solution. TL focuses on transferring knowledge on previously learned IIoT data to another domain to reduce computational complexity and redundant training of ML models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Through the usage of FL and TL, ML-NIDS can be generated that protect IoT user privacy and also can accommodate ML algorithms that can account for heterogeneous data sources.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The development of network intrusion detection approaches has been a critical component in protecting today’s networking infrastructures. With the emergence of IoT, these infrastructures need security contingencies now more than ever. Contemporary IoT NIDS surrounded the usage of signature-based mechanisms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed a signature-based NIDS that involved the usage of both centralized and distributed intrusion detection models. The work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> developed CBSigIDS, a generic framework of collaborative blockchain signature-based intrusion detection systems, which can incrementally build and update a trusted signature database in a collaborative IoT environment. Researchers in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> demonstrated the use of an optimized pattern recognition algorithm to detect such attacks within IoT. The limitation of signature-based methods is that they are static in operational capability and can be circumvented if attackers introduce a level of variability in their malware.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">With the rise of ML, ML-based NIDS has also become a trending technology to protect IoT systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> used a deep neural network to model various NIDS datasets to assess their performance at detecting attacks. This work did not take into account the impact of class imbalance on classifier performance. The work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> proposed a bi-directional long short-term memory neural network on a NIDS dataset to decipher between normal and attack conditions. The limitation of this work lay in the small size of the dataset that was used to create the model. Additionally, the trade-off between the decision parameters was not considered. Researchers in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> applied ML to various open-sourced NIDS datasets. This work did not consider any fog or edge computing devices, which is not representative of real-life practices. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, the researchers observed multiple ML models on an IoT dataset. Though this work formed the basis of contemporary research for NIDS for IoT environments, they did not perform any model hyperparameter optimization that impacts performance. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, authors evaluated six ML models for detecting MQTT-based IoT attacks. The knock on this work is that it only observed performance after training only on an MQTT protocol-based dataset.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Additionally, to preserve privacy efforts in IoT, the usage of FL on IoT has seen some attention from researchers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, the authors performed centralized FL on an IIoT dataset. The work done in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> proposed an FL-based NIDS that trained on multiple views of IoT network data in a decentralized format to detect, classify, and defend against attacks. Lastly, the researchers in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> proposed an FL-based intrusion detection system for securing agricultural-IoT infrastructures using local learning.

After the aggregation of the dataset, the first step is to perform data pre-processing where redundant and/or incomplete information from the datasets can be eliminated to not hamper the performance of any trained ML model. Additionally, we also perform encoding in this step to ensure that no categorical features are being fed into the ML model. Once pre-processed, feature selection is performed to select the features that optimally affect the performance of the trained ML model. Following this, we split the pre-processed and feature-selected dataset into train and test samples. Finally, we parse the trained models into our FTL module.</p>

Any features that seem to have redundancy or do not actively help in the classification task are removed. Examples of such features include data features where all values are the same in magnitude regardless of the labels associated with that data sample. Additionally, we also evaluate the dataset features and eliminate columns that consistently have “infinity” or “NaN” type values. These inputs will not be accepted by an ML classifier and can hamper system performance if used. Additionally, we also perform feature encoding in this stage, where categorical features are encoded to have numerical values to ensure that these inputs are accepted by ML classifiers.

The aim here is to identify dataset features that can be essential to the classification task and prioritize them, along with scaling them to fit within an operational range. To begin, we employ a correlation matrix. This is an algebraic and statistical tool that can be utilized to observe the relationship between two variables in a dataset. A correlation score is given for each pair of features which helps us to determine features that are not important. If it is positive, the features are directly correlated. If it is negative, the features are inversely correlated. The higher the magnitude of the score, the higher the correlation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.

After analysis of the resultant matrix, the features with the lowest correlation scores get dropped. The threshold for dropping features is dependent on the variance of the correlation scores for the data features.
These features get dropped as they result in higher cardinality for the dataset, while not providing any valuable insights into the data. Finally, we scale the resultant features to ensure that all feature magnitudes fit within a prescribed range. This makes sure that any trained model is not biased towards features that have higher magnitudes. This tactic is essential in datasets that have imbalanced magnitudes.

Once trained, the server models get deployed to all the IIoT clients. Within each client, the trained Combo-NN model gets retrained with the local client data. Once all the models are trained, clients send the models back to the server. The server performs federated averaging on these models and deploys the resultant model back to all the clients, and the procedure continues periodically till convergence.

<p id="S3.SS5.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The proposed Combo-NN architecture consists of a CNN and a DNN. In our methodology, we are using Resnet-50 as our CNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. We are utilizing Resnet-50 as it is an effective tool for generalizing nonlinear data in literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. However, other CNN architectures can also be utilized, depending on the proposed application of the FTL. CNNs can be beneficial for performing network intrusion detection as they tend to train fast due to their underlying architecture. Also, CNNs have the capability of training multi-layer networks with gradient descent that is competent to learn complex, high-dimensional, and nonlinear data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. Additionally, we are augmenting multiple hidden layers of a DNN to Resnet-50 for the proposed FTL approach. A DNN is chosen as it provides benefits to performing network intrusion detection as the layers of depth in the network are effective at modeling nonlinear interactions between the various observable features in the network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.

From the observed results, we notice that the GNB classifier achieves the least performance in being able to detect network intrusions with an <span id="S4.SS2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">A</span> score of 75%, an MAP, MAR, and MAF scores of 72%, 80%, and 69%, respectively. We also note that contemporary ML algorithms achieve better performance than the GNB classifier, but these achieved performances are not the optimal solutions. The performance achieved by the proposed Combo-NN-based FTL approach provides the best overall performance compared to the other contemporary ML algorithms. It achieves a 90% accuracy score, and MAP, MAR, and MAF scores of 89%, 90%, and 88% scores, respectively. This is because the FTL technique achieves optimal performance iteratively, making it more suitable for performing network intrusion detection over a wide set of network data. Additionally, the usage of a neural network-based architecture ensures that any deeply correlated network metrics that are not easily visible are identified by the neural network. This showcases that the proposed FTL techniques can effectively model the intrusion types in the dataset and better differentiate between the various labels. Therefore, using the proposed FTL approach can be a more effective mechanism to detect network intrusions in an IIoT setup versus other contemporary ML algorithms.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a new type of intrusion detection mechanism for Industrial IoT devices using the concept of Federated Transfer Learning. As part of this proposed work, we have introduced a novel neural network-based architecture called Combo-NN which conducts network intrusion detection utilizing a combination of a CNN and DNN. To evaluate the efficacy of our proposed approach, we analyze its performance on an open-source IIoT network intrusion detection dataset. Results showcase high performance for the FTL setup between iterations on both the IIoT clients and the server. Additionally, we observe that the proposed FTL setup can achieve better overall performance than contemporary ML algorithms that have previously been used to perform network intrusion detection in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time FTL is being used to perform network intrusion detection for IIoT. Future work will focus on analyzing the performance of the proposed technique to other network intrusion detection datasets, along with developing potential security features to protect the approach from adversarial attacks.</p>
