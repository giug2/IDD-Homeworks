<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The proliferation of the Internet of Things, mobile devices and edge computing enables the collection of a huge amount of data, usually personal data at a large scale<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Learning representation and generalization of this distributed data has been a grand challenge for both academia and industry. Federated learning has been developed to address the above challenge and becomes an effective method enabling the training of a global model on datasets stored across a number of storage sites <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Without moving data out of premises (which is not allowed by regulations in some scenarios <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>) to a centralized server (e.g., cloud), federated learning also addresses the problem of data privacy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A federated learning system is composed of a server and a number of distributed training workers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. The workers perform model training on their local (private) data. The server aggregates the models received from the workers and updates the global model before sending it back to the workers for the next training iteration. Many works in the literature have focused on two challenging issues of federated learning: (i) optimizing the performance of the global model trained in federated learning (e.g., accuracy) to that of the model trained in a centralized manner <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>; and (ii) reducing the communication costs between the workers and server due to the transmission of the global and local models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. For the former, these works propose various approaches for the server to aggregate the local models and update the global model. For the latter, model pruning or model compression has been proposed to reduce the size of the models exchanged between the server and workers. The above works make an assumption that whenever there is a training request from the server, all the workers are ready and have sufficient computational resources for model training. The server will wait for the responses from all the requested workers before doing model aggregation and updating the global model. We refer this to as <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">synchronous federated learning</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">With the emergence of machine learning marketplace <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> implementing federated learning, many data providers (maybe with limited computational resources) can contribute their data to train models of the market customers without worrying about data privacy. Many training requests could be sent to the same data provider or the computational resources of data providers are heterogeneous, making the above assumption no longer valid. Synchronous federated learning becomes harder to achieve as the server has to unnecessarily wait for a longer time for all the workers to complete their training. Thus, there is a need for a novel approach that allows the server to asynchronously update the global model once a training worker has completed its training epoch, referred to as <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">asynchronous federated learning</span>. While there are a few works that consider this challenge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, they mainly focus on developing an aggregation method for the server to aggregate multiple local models into the global model with an aim to approximate the performance of the global model to its counterpart trained in a centralized manner. The training workers need to finish a training epoch (iteration) before receiving the new global model from the server. Due to the heterogeneity of training workers, the global model could have been updated several times from the local models obtained from other workers, and the local model of a slow worker becomes obsolete, thus wasting time and computational resources.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Yet, less research looks into the practical implementation of a federated learning framework considering the security policies of data providers. With the increasing security threats, most networks close all ports by default (even common ports such as port <math id="S1.p4.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="22" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p4.1.m1.1a"><mn id="S1.p4.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml">22</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p4.1.m1.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S1.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p4.1.m1.1.1">22</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p4.1.m1.1c">22</annotation></semantics></math>, which is used for remote access). This forces the implementation of federated learning frameworks (or marketplaces) to use registered (and well-known) services for the communications between the server and workers whether it is control messages or data. This is to say that conventional socket programming using ephemeral ports may not be suitable.</p>

We develop two novel aggregation algorithms used for the server and training workers, respectively. On the server side, the aggregation algorithm allows the server to asynchronously aggregate multiple local models into the global model without waiting for all the training workers to submit their local model. On the worker side, the aggregation algorithm allows the workers to aggregate the new version of the global model into the local model, which is being trained even in the middle of a training epoch, thus reducing the impact of the obsolete information issue. The aggregation algorithms take into account the level of obsolete information, the quality of training data, and the performance of local models, represented by the loss value.</p>

We use cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3) for storing models and retrieving requests. As these technologies are common, the network traffic will not be blocked by the network firewall of the data provider’s infrastructure. We address several practical challenges such as optimizing the communication costs and synchronizing the learning rate among training workers. We implement a training quality monitoring service that allows end-users to closely monitor the performance of the local models obtained from the workers as well as the global model after aggregation by the server. This monitoring service could be very useful to optimize resource utilization and costs: training can be stopped if the model no longer improves its performance. We perform extensive experiments with various datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and the developed framework (<span id="S1.p6.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">Asyn2F</span>).</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Asynchronous training has been widely used in traditional distributed Stochastic Gradient Descent <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> for the heterogeneous environment to avoid the blocking time (or delay) of the training process caused by the low performance of computing resources/devices, sometimes called stragglers. The latency of the network bandwidth in a heterogeneous environment also makes the synchronous training process less efficient. Recently, several asynchronous algorithms have been proposed to solve the limitation of synchronous federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> by removing the delay of stragglers due to both computing performance and network bandwidth. Xie <span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> defined an algorithm that allows the server to update the global model by weighted average immediately whenever receiving a local model from a worker. The server then pushes the newly-updated global model back to the worker for the next training round without waiting for other workers. However, this approach leads to the problem of obsolete information discussed above. Considering a peer-to-peer training platform where there is no central coordinator, the workers communicate with each other like a graph topology, Assran <span id="S2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> and Even <span id="S2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> proposed to use the asynchronous gossip algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> to optimize the models. In these works, each worker has one sending buffer and one receiving buffer; the method repeats two steps until reaching the stop condition. In the first step, each worker locally optimizes the model by epochs (or training rounds). In the second step, the worker sends its model to the neighboring workers after completing a training round/epoch. At the same time, it updates its local model using all the models in the receiving buffer before starting a new training round.</p>

In this mechanism, workers can start training and uploading their local models based on their own decisions, e.g., after a predefined number of training epochs. To reduce the communication cost, the workers divide the model into two parts: i) shallow layers (i.e., feature extraction such as convolutional layers), and ii) deep layers (i.e., classification/regression such as fully connected layers). Each part has a different uploading decision. The server also defines its own aggregation condition, e.g., after receiving a predefined number of local models from workers. When the aggregation condition is satisfied, the server combines the time of transmission delay, data size, and difference in weights between the global model and local models to create a new global model, and then broadcast again to the workers for a new training round.

The authors proposed two levels of asynchronous model aggregation, i.e., at the gateway and cloud server, to reduce the delay of both network and computing devices on the global model since the number of workers is large.</p>

The worker computes the difference between the downloaded global model and the local model after its training iteration and sends the difference to the server. The server then uses the Euclidean distance to compute the adaptive learning rate to update the global model based on the information received from the worker. Recently, Zhang <span id="S2.p3.6.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> developed FedMDS, a framework for semi-asynchronous federated learning. Unlike FedAvg, FedMDS classifies workers into different groups. In each group, the workers synchronously send their local model to the server for aggregation, but the aggregated model of each group is asynchronously updated by the server. Miao <span id="S2.p3.6.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> recently proposed an asynchronous federated learning algorithm using time-weighted and stale model aggregation. The algorithm sets a duration threshold to classify the workers into online workers or stragglers, then uses the delay to compute the contribution weightage of local models into the global model.</p>

The server side consists of two main components. The <span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Aggregation Strategy</span> component includes various model aggregation algorithms. We aim to design our framework as generic as possible so that it can integrate not only our aggregation algorithm but also other algorithms such as the existing ones. The <span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Worker Manager</span> component manages all the workers of the framework. The <span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Worker Proxy</span> helps the server communicate with the workers via advanced message queuing protocols for exchanging control messages, e.g., notification of a new global model or local model submissions. The <span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Storage Service</span> is a third-party component (i.e., a cloud service) used for storing the local models obtained from the workers and the global model aggregated by the server. On the worker side, we design a <span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Model</span> interface that allows users to implement the model using their preferred libraries. The interface also includes functions for the workers to aggregate a new global model into the local model during the training process. Given a defined model, the training pipeline includes functions to retrieve training data and invoke the model training on computing resources. The training pipeline also includes a monitoring module that reports the performance of the local models as well as the training status to a monitoring dashboard for real-time visualization. Via real-time monitoring, users can control the training process such as stopping the training process at a specific worker or the entire training process at the server when achieving a desired performance.</p>

Conventionally, the training is terminated when it reaches a pre-defined number of training epochs. In practice, users may consider the trade-off between the model performance and the training cost (e.g., time or computing resources of the workers). Thus, we incorporate two other different stopping conditions including: (i) maximum training duration, and (ii) desired performance of the model.</p>

The five workers receive the (initialized) global model (illustrated by light green squares) and start the training process at different time instants. Combined with the heterogeneity in computing resources and the size of training datasets, the workers complete their training epoch and send the local model (represented by pink squares) to the server at different time instants. For instance, Worker 2 finishes its training epoch very early compared to Worker 1 and Worker 3 while Worker 4 spends a longer time to finish its training epoch. Without waiting for the new global model, those workers completing their training epoch early will immediately start a new training epoch with their current local model (e.g., Worker 2 and Worker 3). This significantly reduces the idle time of workers and improves resource utilization.

The server will then notify all the workers to download the updated global model.

Worker 2 and Worker 3 started the subsequent training epoch earlier, thus requiring a local model aggregation to accommodate the updated global model to the local model that is currently being trained. The local model aggregation process is denoted as yellow circles. The local models obtained from the local model aggregation process (denoted as purple circles in Fig. <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 3.2.1 Algorithm Overview and Illustration ‣ 3.2 Asynchronous Federated Learning Algorithms ‣ 3 Framework Design and Model Aggregation Algorithms ‣ Asyn2F: An Asynchronous Federated Learning Framework with Bidirectional Model Aggregation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>) at the workers will also be sent to the server for the next global aggregation. In this way, our framework avoids the problem of obsolete information at the worker that takes a longer time for a training epoch while the global model has been updated many times by the local models obtained from other workers that complete the training faster.</p>

It is to be noted that there exist many tools for determining the quality of data and the server can rely on them to request the report of data quality from the workers. Furthermore, metrics for the quality of data are different for different applications. There are many metrics that have been discussed extensively in the literature, such as class overlap, feature relevance, timeliness, completeness, and duplicates explained in detail in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, which can be used to estimate the quality of data.

Due to asynchronous communications between the server and workers, as well as the different sizes of datasets, a training epoch may take a longer time for a particular worker than the other, this monitoring dashboard should also report to end-users the current status of the workers and the server about training time and joined in/out timestamp. This helps end-users to stop training when the trained model attains a desired performance or stop a worker if the contribution of the local model is no longer needed. This feature is useful especially when model training incurs a cost, e.g., the cost of computing and storage resources, communication cost, and the cost of training data.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The communication cost (either time or monetary cost) is a critical problem of federated learning if models are sent back and forth between the server and the workers frequently. To reduce the impact of this problem, the federated learning framework should allow the workers to train the local model independently using their data until reaching a desired performance or a required number of iterations (i.e., epochs), pre-defined as a training parameter. If the local model of a worker attains this threshold, the worker can start exchanging its local model with the server for global aggregation. This is particularly practical, especially for the models that are trained from scratch and normally have low performance in the first few epochs.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the heterogeneity of computing resources and the size of the training dataset of each worker, the training time for an epoch is different among workers. Since the learning rate is decayed depending on the number of epochs performed, the above issue leads to the fact that the local models are trained at the workers with different learning rates. Those local models when aggregated in the global model affect the stability and convergence speed of the global model. To address this issue, the decay function of each worker must be updated according to the number of training epochs of the global model.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we present extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed federated learning approach along with the developed training framework. We use 2 datasets for our experiments: CIFAR10 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> and EMBER <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. While CIFAR10 is a benchmarking dataset used by many works in the literature, EMBER is a malware dataset used in malware detection applications. It contains the feature vector of 1 million samples including both malware samples and benign samples. Benign samples are actually goodware and sometimes contain sensitive information (e.g., email attachments), thus rarely being shared. For both datasets, we assume that the quality of data is the same when splitting into multiple subsets. Thus, global model aggregation and local model aggregation are mostly based on the loss values. We perform various experimental scenarios, each being described in the below sections with the details of experimental infrastructure, dataset distribution, model architecture, and analysis of results.</p>

The experimental results show that <span id="S5.SS1.SSS1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">Asyn2F</span> achieves the best performance compared to the other two existing techniques. The improvement is more significant (up to 2.90%) in the case of non-overlapping and non-iid sub-datasets, which is usually a practical situation where data providers have different (diverse) datasets.
Comparing three methods of learning rate setting, we observe that synchronizing the learning rate among workers achieves the best performance. This reflects the requirement (<span id="S5.SS1.SSS1.p5.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">R4</span>) of the training framework discussed in Section <a href="#S4.SS1" title="4.1 Framework Functional Requirements ‣ 4 Framework Implementation ‣ Asyn2F: An Asynchronous Federated Learning Framework with Bidirectional Model Aggregation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.1</span></a>. It is worth mentioning that the existing works (FedAvg and M-Step KAFL) do not address this issue in their work. When integrating their training techniques into our framework, we additionally implement their techniques with the three learning rate setting strategies, thus providing insightful performance comparison.</p>

Obviously, compared to the case with fewer workers, there is a performance drop due to the scarce distribution of the same number of training data samples to a larger number of workers. In Fig. <a href="#S5.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ 5.1.2 Experiments with larger infrastructures ‣ 5.1 Peformance with CIFAR10 ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Asyn2F: An Asynchronous Federated Learning Framework with Bidirectional Model Aggregation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a> (captured from the monitoring dashboard of the framework), we present the performance evolution of the local models trained by the workers despite small training datasets. All the local models converge to a stabilized performance thanks to the knowledge obtained from the global model, which is in turn aggregated from other local models. The curve represented by the tester is the performance of the global model that stabilizes after a few hours of training. We also observe an interesting behavior of the framework in this experiment. Due to a large number of training workers and small local training datasets, the workers complete their training epoch very fast, especially the workers with GPU resources. These workers quickly submit their local models to the server for aggregation and continue the next training epoch with the new version of the global model aggregated by the server. The issue of obsolete information does not incur with these workers. Nevertheless, the larger the training framework, the more heterogeneous the workers. Those workers with less powerful computing resources will suffer the consequence of the obsolete information issue, thus significantly benefiting when joining our framework.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">EMBER <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> is a malware dataset including 1 million samples, each being represented by a vector of 2381 feature values. There are 300000 benign samples (labeled as 0), 300000 malicious samples (labeled as 1) and the remaining 400000 samples are undefined. We remove the 400000 undefined samples and use 600000 labeled samples for our experiments. We split the data into 7 sub-datasets using the non-overlapping and non-iid splitting methods. We adopt MalConv model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, whose detailed parameters are presented in Table <a href="#S5.T5" title="TABLE V ‣ 5.2.1 Experimental settings ‣ 5.2 Experiments with EMBER Dataset ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Asyn2F: An Asynchronous Federated Learning Framework with Bidirectional Model Aggregation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">V</span></a> and train it on the training framework with 7 training workers and a tester as shown in Table <a href="#S5.T6" title="TABLE VI ‣ 5.2.1 Experimental settings ‣ 5.2 Experiments with EMBER Dataset ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Asyn2F: An Asynchronous Federated Learning Framework with Bidirectional Model Aggregation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VI</span></a>. We note that with only 2381 features representing a sample, the length of the feature vector of the EMBER dataset is much smaller compared to CIFAR10. Even with a deep learning model described in Table <a href="#S5.T5" title="TABLE V ‣ 5.2.1 Experimental settings ‣ 5.2 Experiments with EMBER Dataset ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Asyn2F: An Asynchronous Federated Learning Framework with Bidirectional Model Aggregation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">V</span></a> (which is also much smaller than ResNet18 used for CIFAR10), the workers with GPU resources complete a training epoch very fast. This explains why we split the original dataset into only 7 sub-datasets so that the training time of one epoch on a worker will be long enough to demonstrate the heterogeneity of the framework.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we designed and developed <span id="S6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">Asyn2F</span> an asynchronous federated learning framework with bidirectional aggregation. The framework addresses the intrinsic characteristics of a distributed computing environment where computing and network resources are heterogeneous combined with diversity in training datasets of data providers. We developed two aggregation algorithms used for the server and the workers, respectively. The global model aggregation algorithm allows the server to aggregate multiple local models to create a new version of the global model. The local model aggregation allows training workers to merge the global model into the local model which is being trained as soon as a new version of the global model is available. This addresses the obsolete information issue and enables a fast convergence of the models. We carried out extensive experiments on a benchmarking dataset (CIFAR10) and a more practical dataset (EMBER) to validate the performance of <span id="S6.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">Asyn2F</span>. The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed framework over the recently developed ones. The framework demonstrates its practicality with the use of cloud services for its implementation, thus overcoming the security restrictions of enterprises or organizations to protect the privacy of their data.</p>
