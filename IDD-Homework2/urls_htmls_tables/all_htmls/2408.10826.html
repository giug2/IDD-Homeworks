<p id="id1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a new learning paradigm that enables multiple devices to collaboratively train a shared model while preserving data privacy. However, intensive memory footprint during the training process severely bottlenecks the deployment of FL on resource-constrained devices in real-world cases. In this paper, we propose <span id="id1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">NeuLite</span>, a framework that breaks the memory wall through elastic progressive training. Unlike traditional FL, which updates the full model during the whole training procedure, NeuLite divides the model into blocks and conducts the training process in a progressive manner. Except for the progressive training paradigm, NeuLite further features the following two key components to guide the training process: 1) curriculum mentor and 2) training harmonizer. Specifically, the Curriculum Mentor devises curriculum-aware training losses for each block, assisting them in learning the expected feature representation and mitigating the loss of valuable information.
Additionally, the Training Harmonizer develops a parameter co-adaptation training paradigm to break the information isolation across blocks from both forward and backward propagation. Furthermore, it constructs output modules for each block to strengthen model parameter co-adaptation. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of NeuLite across both simulation and hardware testbeds. The results demonstrate that NeuLite effectively reduces peak memory usage by up to 50.4%. It also enhances model performance by up to 84.2% and accelerates the training process by up to 1.9<math id="id1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\times" display="inline"><semantics id="id1.1.m1.1a"><mo id="id1.1.m1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">×</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id1.1.m1.1b"><times id="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1"></times></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id1.1.m1.1c">\times</annotation></semantics></math>.</p>

<div id="Sx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al. <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> enables multiple devices to collaboratively train a shared model while preserving data privacy.
Instead of gathering the raw data and conducting centralized training on the cloud, FL directly conducts local training on the participating devices and then aggregates the local updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Tian et al. <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Wang et al. <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>; Li et al. <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Fu et al. <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. One fundamental and prevailing challenge that hinders the deployment of FL in real-world cases is the memory wall. During the training process, all the intermediate activations, model weights, and optimizer status are mandated to be retained in the memory, which causes an intensive memory footprint.
For instance, training a MobileNet_v2 on ImageNet with a batch size of 128 consumes 13.5 GB of memory. However, the available RAM for off-the-shelf mobile devices only ranges from 4 to 16 GB <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wu et al. <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2024</a>)</cite>. Moreover, to retrieve high analysis capability, the model architectures are becoming deeper and wider, further increasing the memory footprint.
This means that, due to memory limitations, many low-end devices cannot even afford to support the local training process, and the private data on them cannot benefit the convergence of the global model well.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, several approaches have been proposed
to resolve the resource limitation for FL, which can be mainly divided into the following two categories: 1) model-heterogeneous training  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Cho et al. <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Zhang, Wu, and Yuan <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> and 2) partial training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wang et al. <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2024</a>; Yang et al. <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. Model-heterogeneous training customizes local models according to
the memory budget of each participating device and aggregates different local models through knowledge distillation. However, the distillation process requires a high-quality public dataset, which is usually impractical for FL due to privacy concerns. Partial training tailors the global model through width scaling or depth scaling based on the resource constraints of the participating devices and then allocates the sub-models accordingly. Specifically, width scaling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Diao, Ding, and Tarokh <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> yields sub-models of varying complexity by adjusting the number of channels in the convolutional layers. However, this strategy can compromise the model architecture, leading to performance degradation. While depth scaling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kim et al. <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> customizes sub-models with varying depths to address memory constraints. Meanwhile, this mechanism limits the complexity of the global model that can be trained.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To this end, we propose NeuLite, a novel framework that effectively breaks the memory wall for FL via elastic progressive training. The design of NeuLite is guided by the observation that different layers of the global model exhibit varying convergence rates. The initial layers stabilize quickly as they are responsible for extracting generic features, while the deep layers take more training rounds to retrieve task-specific features. Thus, updating the full model throughout training leads to unnecessarily high memory usage.
Based on this observation, NeuLite first divides the global model into multiple blocks corresponding to different training stages, with each block containing a specified number of layers.
It first trains the first block, safely freezes it after convergence, and then triggers the training of the next one. This process iterates until the full model is effectively trained. In this way, the memory space required for storing intermediate activations and gradients of the frozen layers can be well released. Thus, more devices can meet the memory requirement and contribute to the global model with their private data. However, designing such a progressive training paradigm faces the following two critical challenges guiding the design of the corresponding core approaches.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">•<span id="Sx1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_italic">Challenge 1: Information Loss in Each Stage.</span> Training each block individually, freezing them after convergence, and then triggering the training of the next one can deteriorate model performance.
This is because each block, due to its limited fitting capacity and shortsightedness, tends to learn the features most beneficial to its current stage, leading to the loss of valuable information. This issue is especially concerning in the earlier blocks, which typically have the lowest complexity and are thus less capable of maintaining critical information. As a result, the subsequent blocks experience accuracy stagnation due to the incomplete information provided by these earlier blocks. This cumulative information loss hampers the overall model performance. To address this challenge, we introduce the Curriculum Mentor, which designs curriculum-aware training losses for each block based on the information bottleneck theory, mitigating the valuable information loss during each training stage.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">•<span id="Sx1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_italic">Challenge 2: Information Isolation Across Blocks.</span> Despite the effectiveness of the Curriculum Mentor in mitigating information loss, this training paradigm still faces the challenge of information isolation across blocks. This issue arises because, on the one hand, later blocks initiate training only after the preceding blocks are frozen, preventing them from
adjusting to the evolving features and updates of earlier blocks. On the other hand, since each block is updated independently, there is a lack of gradient information flow between blocks, leading to fragmented learning and misaligned gradients.
To address this, we introduce the Training Harmonizer, which establishes a parameter co-adaptation training paradigm for each block to break information isolation. Specifically, it involves performing model growth in each round to empower later blocks to capture the update trajectories of preceding blocks, enhancing forward propagation interaction. Additionally, it concurrently trains each block alongside the last few layers of the preceding block to break gradient isolation, thereby improving backward propagation interaction. Furthermore, corresponding output modules are designed for each block to strengthen overall information interaction and parameter co-adaptation.</p>

Many approaches have been developed to address the memory constraints in FL, primarily categorized into model-heterogeneous training and partial training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wu et al. <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2024</a>; Yebo et al. <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2024</a>)</cite>. Model-heterogeneous training involves deploying different models on the central server and participating devices, using knowledge distillation for model aggregation. For example, FedMD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li and Wang <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> enables clients to share logits on a public dataset to facilitate information transfer. However, this strategy typically requires a high-quality public dataset, which is not feasible for FL due to privacy concerns.
Partial training involves applying width or depth scaling on the global model to generate models of varying complexity.
For width scaling, methods like Federated Dropout <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Caldas et al. <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018b</a>)</cite> scale the number of channels in the convolutional layers to match device memory capacities. However, this approach compromises the model architecture, leading to performance degradation. For depth scaling, such as in DepthFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kim et al. <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>, local models of different depths are tailored according to device memory capacities. However, the complexity of the global model that can be trained is constrained by the device with the maximum memory capacity. In contrast, NeuLite trains the global model in a progressive manner, effectively reducing peak memory usage.</p>

ProgFed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wang et al. <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> is the most closely related work to ours. It divides the model into blocks and then trains the first block. After a fixed interval, the second block is concatenated and trained together with the first. This process iterates until the full model size is reached.
However, several key differences distinguish our work from ProgFed: 1) <span id="Sx2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Training Paradigm:</span> Unlike ProgFed, which does not employ block freezing and uses fixed intervals for model growth, NeuLite reduces peak memory usage by intelligently freezing blocks and enhances block interaction by growing the model with each round.
2) <span id="Sx2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Training Loss:</span> NeuLite tailors curriculum-aware training losses for each block to mitigate the loss of valuable information, while ProgFed relies solely on cross-entropy.
3) <span id="Sx2.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Training Objective:</span> ProgFed targets reducing communication and computation overhead, while NeuLite is specifically crafted to overcome memory constraints in FL.</p>

<p id="Sx3.SSx2.p2.11" class="ltx_p">As indicated by Eq. (<a href="#Sx3.E3" title="In Curriculum-Aware Training Loss ‣ Method: NeuLite ‣ NeuLite: Memory-Efficient Federated Learning via Elastic Progressive Training" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>), with each layer’s data processing, there is a gradual loss of task-relevant information from the input. Therefore, we can incorporate mutual information into the training objective to minimize task-relevant information loss. However, due to the high dimensionality of the activations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Sakamoto and Sato <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2024</a>)</cite>, directly computing mutual information faces the challenge of high computation complexity. Therefore, we employ the
Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) bottleneck <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ma, Lewis, and Kleijn <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> to estimate it. The HSIC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wang, Dai, and Liu <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> is a statistical measure that quantifies the dependence between variables. In this context, the HSIC bottleneck estimates feature relevance by maximizing the dependence between the input and learned representations while minimizing the influence of irrelevant factors.

<div id="Sx3.SSx3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx3.SSx3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For challenge 2, NeuLite designs the Training Harmonizer, which develops a parameter co-adaptation training paradigm to break information isolation across blocks in both forward and backward propagation. Additionally, it customizes output modules for each block to enhance the co-adaptation of model parameters.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx3.SSx3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx3.SSx3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this training paradigm, subsequent blocks commence training only after the earlier blocks have fully converged and been frozen. This sequential training paradigm introduces a delay that hinders later blocks from promptly adjusting to the evolving features and updates of earlier blocks, interrupting the effective flow of information during forward propagation. The delayed interaction leads to sub-optimal feature learning and performance degradation. To address this issue, the Training Harmonizer employs a dynamic strategy, performing model growth after each training round rather than waiting for convergence. It retrains the first block after completing the final block’s training, allowing subsequent blocks to align with the update trajectories of preceding blocks in real time. This strategy fosters cohesive forward propagation and enhances the model’s adaptability, leading to improved performance and robustness.</p>

<div id="Sx3.SSx3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx3.SSx3.p3.3" class="ltx_p">Moreover, since gradients are confined within each block during updates, this also hinders information interaction during backward propagation, resulting in gradient isolation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Guo et al. <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>. This isolation disrupts the model’s ability to capture dependencies between blocks, leading to fragmented learning and misaligned gradients, which increases the risk of converging to sub-optimal solutions and weakens the model’s overall coherence. To address this issue, the Training Harmonizer concurrently trains the subsequent layers of the previous block alongside the current block to break gradient isolation, as shown in Fig. <a href="#Sx3.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ Parameter Co-Adaptation Training Paradigm ‣ Method: NeuLite ‣ NeuLite: Memory-Efficient Federated Learning via Elastic Progressive Training" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>.

<p id="Sx3.SSx3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Although these two aspects achieve some effectiveness, their gains come from later blocks continuously correcting the training bias of preceding blocks. Specifically, the earlier blocks update based on their perspective, ignoring the existence of later blocks. This short-sighted behavior leads to biased update directions. The later blocks then correct this bias, akin to “better late than never”.
Based on this observation, we address the issue by constructing output modules for each block. To minimize the additional overhead, we replace each subsequent block with a basic layer, such as a convolutional layer, to form the output module. These output modules enable earlier blocks to recognize the existence of subsequent blocks, akin to “having an anchor to windward.”

During the local training process, SGD is employed as the optimizer with a weight decay of 5e-4, and the local epoch is set to 5.

<p id="Sx4.SSx2.SSSx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Table <a href="#Sx4.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ Experiment Setup ‣ Evaluation ‣ NeuLite: Memory-Efficient Federated Learning via Elastic Progressive Training" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> presents benchmark evaluation results of NeuLite across three end-to-end training models on different datasets under Non-IID settings, demonstrating NeuLite’s superior performance across diverse experimental setups. For the CIFAR10 dataset, NeuLite exhibits accuracy enhancements of 10.9%, 12.5%, and 8.4% across the three models compared to AllSmall. This disparity arises because the global model of AllSmall is determined by the device with minimal memory capacity, resulting in limited feature extraction capability.
In comparison to ExclusiveFL, which restricts participation to high-memory devices, resulting in a participation rate of only 11% to 22%, NeuLite demonstrates improvements of 3.6%, 8.3%, and 17.4%, respectively, by effectively leveraging data from low-memory devices. NeuLite outperforms DepthFL with improvements of 15.3%, 12.6%, and 8.3% on the three models. This outcome arises partly because of DepthFL’s ineffective utilization of data from low-memory devices, evidenced by participation rates of 43%, 43%, and 39% across three models, and the imbalance in parameter training caused by only a subset of devices training the later blocks of the global model. While width scaling methods, such as HeteroFL and FedRolex, achieve a 100% participation rate, they compromise the model architecture, especially for models like SqueezeNet with fewer channels. Thus, compared to these methods, NeuLite achieves performance gains ranging from 3.7% to 41.2%. Moreover, both TiFL and Oort, with participation rates of only 11% to 22%, experience accuracy reductions ranging from 4.5% to 16.2%.</p>

<p id="Sx4.SSx2.SSSx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">NeuLite consistently outperforms its counterparts when examining the CINIC10 dataset, with performance improvements ranging from 3.1% to 41.1%. It also excels on the more challenging CIFAR100 dataset, enhancing accuracy by 7.7% to 33.8%. These significant performance gains can be attributed to two critical factors: 1) NeuLite is an inclusive framework that effectively leverages data from all devices. 2) NeuLite incorporates two core components, enabling the effective execution of the progressive training paradigm.</p>

<p id="Sx4.SSx2.SSSx2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We employ the ResNet series models to assess the robustness of NeuLite across training tasks of different complexities. Table <a href="#Sx4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ Experiment Setup ‣ Evaluation ‣ NeuLite: Memory-Efficient Federated Learning via Elastic Progressive Training" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> compares the performance of these strategies on ResNet18 and ResNet34 training tasks. NeuLite demonstrates outstanding performance across both tasks. As the complexity of the training task increases, training ResNet34 results in a high memory footprint. The memory wall leads to methods like ExclusiveFL, TiFL, and Oort being unable to function in such scenarios because of no device with enough memory to train the full model. In contrast, NeuLite effectively mitigates peak memory usage by strategically partitioning the model into different blocks and training them progressively, improving accuracy by up to 84.2% and reducing peak memory usage by up to 47%.</p>

<div id="Sx5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper introduces NeuLite, a framework that addresses the memory constraints in FL through elastic progressive training. NeuLite first divides the global model into blocks and trains each block in a progressive manner. Furthermore,
NeuLite incorporates two core components to guide the training process: Curriculum Mentor and Training Harmonizer. Specifically, the Curriculum Mentor devises curriculum-aware training losses for each block, mitigating the loss of valuable information. The Training Harmonizer develops a parameter co-adaptation training paradigm to break the information isolation across blocks and constructs output modules for each block to strengthen model parameter co-adaptation. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate NeuLite’s superiority in addressing memory constraints in FL.</p>
