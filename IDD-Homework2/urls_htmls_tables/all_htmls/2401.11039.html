<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Radio signal classification and modulation recognition is a broadly studied wireless application that aims to classify radio signals and detect the employed modulation methods in an autonomous way. It can be used for radio fault detection, spectrum interference monitoring, and other signal regulatory applications. The main difficulty in radio signal classification problems lies in the high dimensional input data that are usually used. In recent years, the deep neural network (DNN) has been widely applied in this area with promising results, given its ability to capture features and extract manageable reduced-dimension representation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. However, most of the existing DNN-based signal classification works adopt a centralized training approach, in which all the training samples are collected from local servers and gathered at a global server to train a centralized model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is an emerging machine learning (ML) technique that allows distributed participants to train ML models in a decentralized manner. With the extensive applications of FL, it has become an efficient way to train radio signal classification models with multiple receivers due to its benefits in terms of privacy and scalability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. In FL-based radio signal classification, training data will be kept locally, and models will be trained at each receiver. Only local model weights will be sent to the global server for global model aggregation. In this way, FL can leverage the computing resources of distributed servers and reduce the risk of data leakage.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, there are still some limitations of the existing commonly used FL algorithms while applying them to real applications. On the one hand, FL methods always suffer from slow and unstable convergence, which may lead to poor performance. It shows particularly poor performance under non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data distribution and while using realistic, imperfect wireless network data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. This can be explained by the fact that heterogeneity of the training data held by the participants and the noise in the dataset can lead to weight divergence, which in turn affects the training process.
On the other hand, FL algorithms are usually vulnerable to poisoning attacks from malicious participants. Due to the inherently distributed structure and privacy protection strategies, participants in FL are more difficult to regulate and easier to attack and manipulate. By poisoning the local dataset of one or more participants, the attackers can send malicious updates to the global model, which may lead to performance degradation in both the global model and all the other local models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To address the above-mentioned limitations of FL, we propose a more efficient and robust FL algorithm by integrating the attention mechanisms into the global model aggregation. Attention mechanisms are deep learning techniques that can be used to provide an additional focus on a specific component by mimicking cognitive attention<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. By applying the attention model to FL, the global model can focus on some particular participants by putting more importance and ignore other participants by putting less importance. In this way, the performance of FL can be improved both in secure environments and under attacks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Inspired by these thoughts, in this work, we propose a dual-attention model weighted FL-based radio signal classification framework. To be more specific, two attention models are combined to calculate the amount of attention that is cast on each participant, it will then be used to determine the weights of local models during the global aggregation. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified on a real-world dataset. It shows great versatility and outperforms existing algorithms, both in secure systems and in systems under attack. In the secure system, it reduces the classification loss by 7.4% compared to the commonly used FL algorithm. In the system under attack, it improves the classification accuracy by 11.5% compared to the baseline defense method. The proposed FL framework can not only be used for modulation classification but also for other wireless network applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that exploits the possibility of defending against poisoning attacks in FL by attention-weighted global model aggregation.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There have been many existing studies that apply DNN to radio signal classification. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, an in-depth study is conducted to investigate the performance of deep learning-based radio signal classification under different settings. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, data augmentation is performed to classify the modulation categories of received radio signals with limited training data. Most of these works train DNN models in a centralized manner, which may cause privacy and scalability concerns. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, a FL-based modulation type classification is proposed under the condition of imbalanced data and varying noise. However, the majority of such techniques may run the risk of slow convergence and vulnerability to attacks in practical applications. In our work, we consider <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> as a baseline and compare it with our proposed algorithm. In addition, other works have studied the attacks and defense methods in the radio signal classification application. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> proposes an adversarial attack against deep learning-based wireless signal classifiers by crafting a common adversarial perturbation. Different from this work, we focus on a more stealthy attack technique that involves data poisoning on FL through malicious participants.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Besides the above, several works have applied attention models to FL. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, an attention-weighted federated deep reinforcement learning model is proposed for device-to-device assisted heterogeneous collaborative edge caching. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, attention-weighted federated learning is leveraged to train traffic steering models across distributed user equipment. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, a dual attention-based federated learning framework is proposed for traffic prediction. Although these works integrate attention schemes with FL in an effective way, they are more applicable to secure systems and do not apply to systems under attack. Even worse, the introduction of attention schemes may make the system more vulnerable to attacks from malicious participants since they may use tactics to grab more attention during global training. Aside from this, these algorithms may have specific requirements for the application scenario, for example, requiring a large number of participants or only applicable to specific applications. In contrast, our proposed algorithm is versatile in both secure systems and systems under attack and shows good performance in both scenarios.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Other than that, there are also some existing works about potential threats and countermeasures in FL frameworks. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, a label-flipping data poisoning attack is proposed as a common type of attack caused by malicious participants in FL. In this work, we use a label-flipping attack as our threat model in the system under attack. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> proposes multi-Krum as an effective defense mechanism against data poisoning attacks in FL through Byzantine-robust global model aggregation, which we use as a baseline in the attacked system. Despite being able to achieve a defensive effect in some application scenarios, the multi-Krum defense requires prior knowledge about the exact number or upper limit of attackers. In contrast, our proposed algorithm does not require any prior knowledge of attacks, and it performs better than the baseline defense.</p>

For each receiver, we assume that there is a dominant modulation type accounting for roughly half of the training samples, while all other modulation types account for the other half of the training data combined. For malicious participants with label-flipping data poisoning attacks, all training samples in the local training dataset that have a dominant class label will change their labels to another different class label. Consequently, during local updates, the malicious participants will learn incorrect updates from poisoned data and spread the incorrect updates to the global model through global aggregation. With these settings, the superiority of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated both in a secure environment and under attack.</p>

In this structure, two attention models are set up to evaluate the importance of each local model during the global aggregation. The first attention model is to perform self-attention among all the local models, and the second attention model is to perform temporal attention evaluation between the local models in the current iteration and the global model in the previous iteration. These attention models help to promote FL training by giving different attention weights to different local models. We further illustrate the scheme with a scenario of a system under attack. As it can be observed from Fig. <a href="#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ IV-A Attention model ‣ IV Dual attention model-weighted FL for radio signal classification ‣ Federated Learning with Dual Attention for Robust Modulation Classification under Attacks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, the second participant is assumed to be attacked, and the attack will be reflected in the local model parameters. As a result, the dual-attention scheme will cast less attention on the second local model and give it lower weight. In this way, the incorrect updates from the malicious participants are prevented from affecting the global model. The details of the two attention models are explained as follows.</p>

In contrast, our proposed algorithm is still able to converge stably and fast and demonstrates almost the same level of accuracy as under a secure system. After the training, the classification loss of our proposed algorithm is 11.5% lower than the multi-Krum algorithm. These results further validate the defensive effect of the proposed algorithm.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we proposed an efficient and robust attention-weighted FL algorithm and applied it to a radio signal classification scenario. We decide on the attention weight for each participant in FL through two attention models. The first attention model performs a self-attention evaluation between all the participants to find the connections between local models. The second attention model decides the temporal attention between the global model in the last iteration and the local models in the current iteration, and it helps to align the training level of participants. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified on a real-world dataset. It shows great versatility and outperforms existing algorithms, both in secure systems and in systems under attack. It reduces the classification loss by 7.4% in the secure system and improves the classification accuracy by 11.5% under attacks.</p>
