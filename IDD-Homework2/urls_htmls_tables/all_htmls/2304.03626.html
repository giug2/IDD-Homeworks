<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">The standard class-incremental continual learning setting assumes a set of tasks seen one after the other in a fixed and pre-defined order. This is not very realistic in federated learning environments where each client works independently in an asynchronous manner getting data for the different tasks in time-frames and orders totally uncorrelated with the other ones.
We introduce a novel federated learning setting (AFCL) where the continual learning of multiple tasks happens at each client with different orderings and in asynchronous time slots.
We tackle this novel task using prototype-based learning, a representation loss, fractal pre-training, and a modified aggregation policy.
Our approach, called FedSpace, effectively tackles this task as shown by the results on the CIFAR-100 dataset using 3 different federated splits with 50, 100, and 500 clients, respectively.
The code and federated splits are available at

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) involves distributed learning across multiple heterogeneous devices, coordinated by a central server, without sharing private data.
In its standard fashion, FL implies a static configuration, where clients have access to the same local data and do not change their tasks for the entire training process. Furthermore, the training procedure is typically divided into rounds perfectly aligned across the different clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">This setting, even if reasonable for research purposes, does not represent a realistic real-world learning setting where the clients (e.g., smartphones, autonomous cars, etc..) typically acquire data from onboard cameras or other devices while the training goes on and can be required to learn new tasks during time. Furthermore, each client asynchronously works independently from the others and can get new data at any time typically misaligned with the others.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Recently the continual learning (CL) paradigm has emerged as a more practical setting to mimic a real-world learning process, where new data and tasks are likely to be encountered over time.
We, therefore introduce a new setting combining continual and federated learning. We allow each client to follow its own continual learning path in an asynchronous way with respect to the other clients, while the server orchestrates the distributed training in order to safely aggregate the different learned models coming from the streams of information locally acquired at the clients.</p>

Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> as an alternative way to train a global model
from a federation of devices keeping their data local,
and communicating to the server only the model parameters.
The iterative FedAvg algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> represents the standard approach to address FL. First, the server randomly selects a subset of clients, which will perform training on their local data and send back to the server their updated models. Then, the server computes the global model as the weighted mean of the received models and repeats the previous step for many rounds. Despite its simplicity, FedAvg empirically demonstrates remarkable results.
In the context of systems heterogeneity, FedAvg does not allow participating devices to perform variable amounts of local work
based on the constraints of their underlying system.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">This issue is addressed by FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, which can be seen as a generalization and re-parametrization of FedAvg, providing a theoretical convergence guarantee when learning over data from non-identical distributions.</p>

improved version of the distributed optimization algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> where a fixed number of
(stochastic) gradient steps are used in place of a proximal point update. It deals with the problem of client drift by introducing control variates. In particular, the difference between the local control variate and the global control variate is used to correct the gradients in local training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">However, both FedProx and SCAFFOLD, do not provide advantages over FedAvg
when training deep learning models on image datasets. This motivates MOON <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> to propose a new approach for handling non-IID image datasets. It proposes to enforce similarity between model representations to correct the local training of individual parties,
conducting contrastive learning at model-level.</p>

This setup differs from our setting since in our case the asynchronously is not in the time slot but in the task progression and update while we perform the aggregation with multiple clients at a time as in the standard setting.</p>

Deep neural networks experience catastrophic forgetting when trained on new data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
The objective of continual learning, therefore,
is to enable a model to learn from a never-ending stream of data without the need to retrain the model from scratch every time new data become available.</p>

A first direction to mitigate catastrophic forgetting is to store and replay samples of old classes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
Another direction is to build a separate generative model able to reproduce old samples, and reuse them while training the model on new classes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.</p>

Very recently, some works started to address federated learning in settings, where the learned tasks change over time <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>,

Focusing on settings where the task changes over time, i.e., on continual learning, some recent interesting works can be pointed out.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p10" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p10.1" class="ltx_p">A preliminary work
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> exploits the storage of training samples at the server side, compromising the privacy of the clients’ data. In FedWEIT<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> the network weights are decomposed into global federated parameters and sparse task-specific parameters. Each client receives selective knowledge from other clients by taking a weighted combination of their
task-specific parameters. However, they still require a buffer for data replay and does not scale when increasing the number of clients or tasks, due to the communication overhead.
The task of Federated Class-Incremental Learning is addressed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> with a focus on the privacy of the systems: differently from previous works, they only store perturbed images in a replay memory, while the server has no prior knowledge about when local clients will receive the data for new classes.</p>

<div id="S2.p11" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p11.1" class="ltx_p">Another federated continual learning scenario is considered in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Here, the server is pre-trained on a set of classes, corresponding to the first task. Then, each client learns the remaining ones by following its own task stream. Differently from the proposed AFCL setting, clients explore new sets of classes synchronously.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.15" class="ltx_p">Recent studies suggest that pre-training allows to improve performances for the downstream task and speeds up training in federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. We resort to the pre-training strategy with fractal images proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> for a centralized setting, and use it to pre-train the server model before starting the learning at clients’ side.
Fractal images are generated from affine Iterated Function Systems (affine IFS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, therefore they provide perfect label accuracy at zero cost, no privacy issues, and most importantly do not contain images or classes present in the CIFAR-100 dataset, hence they are the best candidate in FL.
Additionally, in AFCL, since clients experience new classes inside different time slots, pretraining allows to limit client drift and achieve a better alignment of their internal representations since they all start from an initial common feature space.

<p id="S4.SS4.p1.7" class="ltx_p">Previous works showed that contrastive learning can be efficiently used in continual learning to tackle catastrophic forgetting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. Thus, we introduce an additional loss function based on a contrastive paradigm that encourages feature vectors of the same class
to be close together while pushing away from each other
feature vectors belonging to different classes.

the loss enforces each client to learn locally new classes, clustering their features in a consistent way with their past representation obtained from the server (and therefore from the other clients), while at the same time enforcing separation between features of different classes.

Typically in standard FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> the server model is updated with the weighted average of the model parameters of each client participating in that round, by weighting his contribution depending on the number of images seen in that round. In our setting, there is no guarantee that all the classes are present in the considered step and furthermore some clients could have just started the learning with the new data stream and have a not very reliable model. In order to stabilize the aggregation avoiding drifts due to unreliable clients and the forgetting of old classes, we perform a weighted average between the newly computed model and the previous model present at the server side.

<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. We introduce 3 strongly non-IID splits with 10 tasks each made of 10 classes, while the total number of clients is equal to 50, 100, and 500, respectively.
To create them, first, a distribution of the number of samples for each client is computed using a power-law distribution. Next, for each client, the partitioning is done based on a Dirichlet distribution, where the proportions of samples from each class are randomly sampled from the distribution. The parameter of the Dirichlet distribution <math id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\alpha" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">α</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝛼</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1c">\alpha</annotation></semantics></math> was set equal to 3.

Given the novelty of the setting, there is no other work explicitly developed for the task. However, we compared our proposed method with a baseline, e.g., FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, that is the standard approach for FL and with PASS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, a state-of-the-art non-exemplar algorithm for class incremental learning, purposefully adapted to the considered FL setting. In practice, it computes local prototypes at each round and makes use of a prototype-based loss. The aggregation at the server side is done using FedAvg.</p>

The main reason is the catastrophic forgetting, here experienced both
in a continual learning and in a federated learning way.
At each communication round, due to client drift and misaligned learning of new classes across the selected clients, the global model loses knowledge of the previously learned classes.
Moreover, when a set of classes is no more experienced by clients selected in future rounds, those are forgotten as well known in continual learning.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we introduced a novel realistic setting for asynchronous federated continual learning (AFCL) detailing the main challenges.
Then, we presented our framework (FedSpace) which starts by
performing pre-training at the server side with fractal images.
Next, local training on clients is driven by a loss applied to the augmented old global prototypes and by a contrastive representation loss used to properly allocate the prototypes of new (global) classes while at the same time aligning the new local classes with their past location. Finally, a modified server aggregation strategy reduces client drift.
To evaluate the performance of FedSpace,
we proposed 3 federated splits of the CIFAR-100 dataset, using 50, 100, and 500 clients, that we used for the experimental evaluation.
Our approach reached state-of-the-art results when compared with competing methods adapted to our setting.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Further research will be devoted to the development of more advanced aggregation strategies at the server side and to the combination of the proposed approach with other state-of-the-art continual learning methods.</p>
