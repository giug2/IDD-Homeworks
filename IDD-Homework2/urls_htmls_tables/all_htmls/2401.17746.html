<p id="id5.id1" class="ltx_p">Distillation-based federated learning has emerged as a promising collaborative learning approach, where clients share the output logit vectors of a public dataset rather than their private model parameters. This practice reduces the risk of privacy invasion attacks and facilitates heterogeneous learning. The landscape of poisoning attacks within distillation-based federated learning is complex, with existing research employing traditional data poisoning strategies targeting the models’ parameters. However, these attack schemes primarily have shortcomings rooted in their original designs, which target the model parameters rather than the logit vectors. Furthermore, they do not adequately consider the role of logit vectors in carrying information during the knowledge transfer process. This misalignment results in less efficiency in the context of distillation-based federated learning. Due to the limitations of existing methodologies, our research delves into the intrinsic properties of the logit vector, striving for a more nuanced understanding. We introduce a two-stage scheme for logit poisoning attacks, addressing previous shortcomings. Initially, we collect the local logits, generate the representative vectors, categorize the logit elements within the vector, and design a shuffling table to maximize information entropy. Then, we intentionally scale the shuffled logit vectors to enhance the magnitude of the target vectors. Concurrently, we propose an efficient defense algorithm to counter this new poisoning scheme by calculating the distance between estimated benign vectors and vectors uploaded by users. Through extensive experiments, our study illustrates the significant threat posed by the proposed logit poisoning attack and highlights the effectiveness of our defense algorithm.</p>

In this approach, individual devices or nodes undertake the training process locally. Only the relevant updates, rather than raw training data, are shared with a central server for aggregation. This methodology attempts to balance efficiency and privacy; however, traditional FL still faces risks. Privacy leakage from uploading local model parameters has not only been identified but has also proven to be a tangible threat to user confidentiality. Distillation-based federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> has emerged as a significant area of research to address these security and privacy challenges, inspired by the knowledge transfer algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. By exchanging local model prediction results on public datasets rather than plain model parameters or gradients, distillation-based federated learning promises to provide enhanced protection against potential breaches. It has become a subject of extensive academic investigation. In this approach, the local model output of prediction is mainly in the form of logit vectors, which are the unnormalized outputs of the model’s final feature encoding layer before applying a softmax function. Distillation-based federated learning offers an innovative approach to enhancing security in collaborative machine learning. Moreover, distillation-based federated learning introduces the capability for heterogeneous FL, allowing users to maintain their own unique model structure while still acquiring knowledge from others<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the abundance of research analyzing poisoning attacks in the context of distillation-based federated learning, prevalent studies often employ antiquated methods that fail to effectively address the unique challenges posed by this learning approach.
For example, Cronus <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> is an FL framework that employs model distillation for collaborative learning. Local nodes use private data to train the model and further generate soft labels from public datasets. These soft labels are aggregated at a central server and then distributed back to nodes. The authors provide an in-depth examination of both targeted and untargeted poisoning attacks employed in the study, an approach intended to evaluate the effectiveness of their proposed scheme robustly. They tested four different poisoning attack schemes, label flip poisoning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, naive poisoning (PAF) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, little is enough attack (LIE) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, and one far one mean (OFOM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. The experimental results affirm that a robust FL scheme is assured under these attacks.
Distillation-Based Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (DS-FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> algorithm enhances model performance by sharing local model outputs. It uses labeled open datasets as shared datasets for further local model training. These shared datasets can not only expand the datasets but also can boost local models’ performance. In order to examine the robustness of their scheme, the authors adapt the model poisoning attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> to DS-FL, with malicious clients transmitting logit vectors produced by an arbitrary model. However, it should be noted that the model poisoning attack was initially designed to attack FL. Consequently, implementing this particular poisoning attack strategy in the given context fails to yield optimal performance.
Cheng <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> introduced a framework called Federated Learning of Larger Server Models via Selective Knowledge Fusion (FedGEMS). Within this framework, the server model strategically gathers insights from its own analysis and teacher clients, enhancing its comprehension of the learning process. The author also uses the previously proposed poisoning attack to evaluate the robustness of the proposed scheme, including PAF, LIE, and OFOM. Similarly, these antiquated attack strategies fail to exert any significant influence on their FL framework.
While most of these attack strategies aim to poison the dataset or model parameters to alter the distribution of logit vectors, they often fail to account for the primary factor encapsulating knowledge within the logit vectors. In other words, these poisoning strategies are designed based on the distribution of the model parameters other than the underlying logic of the logit vectors’ ability to transfer knowledge. Therefore, the poisoning attack designed to disrupt the expression of the logit vectors based on their knowledge transfer principle can significantly threaten the distillation-based federated learning schemes, highlighting an urgent need to address these vulnerabilities.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To address the above challenge, in this work, we delve into an analysis of the knowledge encapsulated in logit vectors, exploring it from two critical perspectives: the inter-class similarity and the position of maximum value. The former assesses the local model’s judgment on how closely related a sample is to other classes. The latter indicates the certainty with which a sample is assigned to a particular class. Building on this foundation, we design targeted attack schemes designed to dismantle the information within the logit vectors by well-designed shuffling and scaling. By doing so, we develop schemes to destroy the information carried in these logit vectors and mislead models to the greatest extent possible, thereby maximizing the poisoning effect. The overview of our poisoning process is depicted in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Logit Poisoning Attack in Distillation-based Federated Learning and its Countermeasures" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. We further design a robust aggregation algorithm to defend the federated learning scheme against poisoning attacks. This defense strategy is founded on estimating the distribution of benign vectors and calculating the distance between user-uploaded vectors and these benign representations.

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Distillation-based federated learning utilizes model distillation techniques, also known as knowledge transfer methods, to share knowledge. Such an approach exchanges model output logit vectors instead of model parameters, providing an alternative approach to centralizing local models.
Cronus <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> is an FL framework proposed by Chang <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> that uses the model distillation technique to achieve collaborative learning. During the training process, each local node trains its model on private data and then makes predictions on the public dataset, producing soft labels for server aggregation. Finally, the server aggregates the collected soft labels and sends the resulting information back to the local nodes, allowing them to update their models with the latest global aggregation update.
Li <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> proposed Federated Learning with Model Distillation (FedMD). Each participating party uses private data and a public dataset for local training in this approach. Afterward, each party transmits its predicted logit vectors on the public dataset to the server. The server aggregates these logit vectors and returns them to each party for the following process iteration.
Lin <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> proposed an innovative method involving ensemble distillation for model fusion. In this technique, the central model is trained using data sourced from the outputs of various client models. This knowledge distillation strategy offers the adaptability required for aggregating heterogeneous client models, which may differ in size, numerical precision, or architecture design.
Itahara <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> proposed an innovative algorithm called DS-FL. In DS-FL, the outputs of local models are shared, and the communication cost is solely dependent on the output dimensions, not the model size. The shared model outputs a label for each instance in the open dataset, generating a new dataset. Leveraging this expanded dataset for further training local models can improve their performance.
Cheng <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> introduced an approach in FL known as FedGEMS. In this framework, the large deeper server model strategically acquires knowledge from numerous teacher clients and itself to efficiently fuse and accumulate knowledge. This process fosters an accumulation of enriched knowledge, thereby significantly boosting the model performances on both server and client aspects.
Fang <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> proposed Robust Heterogeneous Federated Learning (RHFL) to handle label noise while conducting heterogeneous federated learning. RHFL employs public data to align feedback from heterogeneous models without requiring additional shared global models for collaboration. It also uses a robust, noise-tolerant loss function to minimize the negative impact of internal label noise<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, in situations where feedback from other participants is challenging, a novel client confidence re-weighting scheme has been designed to adaptively assign corresponding weights to each client during collaborative learning.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Poisoning attacks pose a significant security threat in FL. A malicious participant can intentionally introduce tainted data or updates into the shared model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, undermining its accuracy or compromising its integrity. Such attacks can lead to decreased accuracy and the implementation of hidden backdoors within the model. Adversaries can exploit these vulnerabilities to degrade the model’s performance or extract sensitive data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.
Works have demonstrated that a single Byzantine user could manipulate the parameter server to select any vector. As a result, the Byzantine user could impact the convergence of any conventional averaging-based FL methodolog <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.
Label-flipping attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> was proposed by Fung <span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> to reduce the performance of the global model. The attacker intentionally modifies the labels of adversary examples to mislead the model during training, causing it to learn incorrect associations between features and labels.
A backdoor attack is another type of attack that can be achieved by poisoning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. In such an attack, the adversary modifies specific features or small regions of the training data to implant a backdoor trigger into the model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. When the model is supplied with untainted data, it performs as expected. However, the presence of the backdoor trigger in the input causes the model to predict the class predetermined by the attacker invariably. This attack carries significant risk, allowing an attacker to manipulate the model’s behavior in a specific context while leaving its overall performance on unrelated tasks unaffected.
Bagdasaryan <span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> carried out a backdoor attack against the FL system using a model replacement technique, which one or more malicious participants can carry out. By replacing the model with a modified version with backdoor functionality, the attacker could manipulate the model’s behavior to their advantage.
Fang <span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> explored local model poisoning threats in Byzantine-robust FL. The authors comprehensively analyzed local model poisoning attacks on Byzantine-robust federated learning systems. Their study formalized the adversarial behavior as an optimization problem to decrease the global model accuracy, assuming that attackers had infiltrated certain clients, who then manipulated the local model parameters on these compromised devices during the learning stage.
Yang <span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> introduced a new type of model poisoning attack called Model Shuffle Attack (MSA). While differential privacy protects sensitive data by adding calculated noise, this could allow attackers to avoid being detected <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. Unlike other model poisoning attacks, the compromised model performs as expected during testing, which obscures the malevolent alterations. Nonetheless, the manipulated model detrimentally impacts the overall model’s learning pace.</p>

As with many previous studies on poisoning attacks, we consider untargeted attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> in this work. In contrast to targeted attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> untargeted attack aims to degrade the usability and maximize the error rate of the resulting model rather than generating specific outcomes for certain instances. Specifically, the untargeted attacker’s objective is to corrupt the global logits by maliciously modifying the logit vectors generated by the local model, ultimately aiming to decrease the accuracy of the resulting model. In the conventional poisoning attacks against the FL system, the execution of the poisoning attack is modeled as an optimization problem, with the attacker’s objective defined as inducing directed deviation. Specifically, the attacker aims to maximize the divergence of the global model’s parameter update direction from its correct path. However, this approach is not applicable to our scenario. In the distillation-based federated learning paradigm, the client cannot upload model parameters. Knowledge transfer is facilitated solely through the logit vectors generated by the local model. Consequently, an attacker cannot directly affect the global model’s deviation by manipulating the local model’s parameters. In our work, we approach this challenge from a distinct perspective. Instead of controlling the update direction of the model parameters, we aim to distort the information contained within the local output logit vectors to accomplish the poisoning objective.</p>

In this work, we assume that the attacker has control over numerous malicious clients and can manipulate the uploaded predictive outputs yet lacks knowledge about the benign clients and the ability to modify them. Importantly, we stipulate that the number of devices under the attacker’s control should not exceed 50%, as surpassing this limit would render the tampering of the model a straightforward task. We formulate the poisoning process with Eq. <a href="#S3.E8" title="In III-B logit poisoning attacks on distillation-based federated learning ‣ III Proposed Formulation ‣ Logit Poisoning Attack in Distillation-based Federated Learning and its Countermeasures" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>, where the <math id="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\alpha" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">α</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1">𝛼</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.p2.1.m1.1c">\alpha</annotation></semantics></math> is auxiliary information the attacker possesses.

<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">First of all, the attacker needs to create a shuffle table to distort the correlation among the various logit elements in logic vectors. Specifically, the attacker first trains a classifier using a public dataset. This pre-trained classifier’s output logit vectors then undergo statistical analysis, leading to the generation of unique shuffle tables for each class. In the ensuing poisoning attack, the attacker utilizes this shuffle table to shuffle the logit elements within the logit vectors. Subsequently, the attacker scales the permuted logit elements to intensify the poisoning impact.</p>

<div id="S4.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Overall, our poisoning attack aims to undermine the principle of knowledge representation in logit vectors.
Each logit element in the logit vectors corresponds to the raw prediction score for a particular class. If the logit for a class is relatively high, it signifies that the model is highly confident that the given input corresponds to that class. The relative magnitudes of logit elements for different classes reflect the model’s confidence level in assigning each class to a given input. In cases where the logit elements for several classes are similar, the model still determines which class to assign to the given input. This can also signify where the model struggles to distinguish between certain classes. Specifically due to these principles, distillation-based federated learning can extract knowledge. Therefore, in our poisoning attack, the attacker must disrupt these principles to amplify the error.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S4.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In our attack strategy, we first initiate the disruption of the logit vectors through a shuffling procedure. The following section explains the reason and procedure for this strategy’s adoption. As mentioned earlier, one of our poisoning attack’s core principles is to disrupt the associativity of the logit elements in logit vectors. The relative discrepancies between the logit elements of distinct classes signify the model’s preference among those classes for a certain input. For similar classes, the model might generate comparable logit elements for these classes in a logit vector. For example, consider an image from the MNIST <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> dataset; If the target label is ’9’, both ’9’ and ’7’ will register high logit values in the model-generated logit vector due to the shared characteristics between ’9’ and ’7’. As such, these logit values reflect the model’s judgment regarding the degree of similarity in the data attributes.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">An additional goal of implementing the shuffling strategy is to misdirect the trained model towards the target label, typically represented by the maximum logit value within the logit vector. The maximum logit value holds the highest significance in the logit vector. It does two things: first, it points to the target label of the provided input data, and second, it mirrors the degree of certainty the model holds about this classification. As a result of these factors, the maximum logit value captures and holds the most critical information the model provides. Therefore, in the context of a logit vector, swapping the highest and lowest values can result in severe damage. This action not only misdirects the model’s data interpretation but also exacerbates the issue by steering the target label towards the most dissimilar category. Essentially, it inaccurately aligns the input data with the least probable class, thereby significantly distorting the model’s comprehension and subsequent training.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">We categorize the logit elements within the logit vector into three distinct groups according to their values, namely, ’the most likely’, ’likely’, and ’the least likely’. This classification facilitates more precise manipulation of the logit elements. The application of k-means clustering <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>, chosen for its efficiency in handling this relatively low-dimensional space, aids this process.

Specifically, we mark the original logit elements in a logit vector into three groups, with logit elements within the same group belonging to the same class. The group’s information entropy rises as it contains a greater variety of logit element types.

Subsequently, we calculate the entropy based on these tallied frequencies. While maintaining the size of each group, we further proceed with shuffling. The whole shuffling process is trying to maximize the information entropy of the three groups. Throughout the shuffling process, we continuously evaluate the information entropy of the logit elements within the group. The maximization entropy process is formulated in Algorithm <a href="#alg2" title="Algorithm 2 ‣ IV-B Shuffling Strategy ‣ IV Attack Method Design ‣ Logit Poisoning Attack in Distillation-based Federated Learning and its Countermeasures" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. Following the shuffling process, we undertake the fine-tuning of the result vector. As previously highlighted, the swapping of the largest logit element in a vector with the smallest one can cause significant misdirection. However, given that the entire shuffling process is random, we can’t guarantee such an occurrence. Consequently, in the concluding phase, we manually adjust the vector to ensure that the position originally occupied by the smallest logit element now hosts the largest one.</p>

The scaling operation also holds significant utility in the context of logit poisoning, given that the knowledge carried by the logit vectors plays a pivotal role during the knowledge transfer phase. Since the shuffled logit vectors are already capable of misguiding the model that is trained with it, our goal is merely to magnify the error. In order to accomplish this, we typically employ a scaling factor greater than 1. By scaling, the poisonous logit vectors can maximize their poisoning effect during the aggregation process and subsequent training process.
The whole poisoning process can be formulated as Eq. <a href="#S4.E12" title="In IV-C Scaling Strategy ‣ IV Attack Method Design ‣ Logit Poisoning Attack in Distillation-based Federated Learning and its Countermeasures" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">12</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p1.2" class="ltx_p">As previously discussed, we can’t optimize the poisoning effect using the offset direction due to the differing nature of our poisoning targets. In many conventional FL poisoning schemes, the effectiveness of the poisoning attack is typically optimized by either maximizing the loss function or the deviation of the vector. Such methods aim to inflict maximum damage to the model or to distort the vector direction away from the normal direction.
However, such approaches can’t be applied to our scenario to optimize the poisoning effect, as they do not completely capture the impact of poisoning. For instance, if cosine similarity is used to measure the poisoning effect, the aim would be to minimize the similarity between the poisonous and original vectors. Therefore, negating the original vector would accomplish this. However, this doesn’t disrupt the knowledge embedded in the logit vectors to the maximum extent. For example, consider a model that produces a logit vector of <math id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\begin{pmatrix}0.9&amp;0.8&amp;-0.9&amp;-0.8\end{pmatrix}^{\mathsf{T}}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1a"><msup id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.2" xref="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.2.cmml"><mrow id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml"><mo id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1" xref="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml">(</mo><mtable columnspacing="5pt" id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mtr id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1a" xref="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mtd id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1b" xref="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">0.9</mn></mtd><mtd id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1c" xref="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1" xref="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.cmml">0.8</mn></mtd><mtd id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1d" xref="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mrow id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1" xref="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.cmml"><mo id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1a" xref="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.cmml">−</mo><mn id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.2" xref="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.2.cmml">0.9</mn></mrow></mtd><mtd id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1e" xref="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mrow id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1" xref="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.cmml"><mo id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1a" xref="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.cmml">−</mo><mn id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.2" xref="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.2.cmml">0.8</mn></mrow></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2" xref="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml">)</mo></mrow><mi id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.2.2" xref="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.2.2.cmml">𝖳</mi></msup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.2">superscript</csymbol><apply id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1">matrix</csymbol><matrix id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1"><matrixrow id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1a.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1"><cn type="float" id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1">0.9</cn><cn type="float" id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1">0.8</cn><apply id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1"><minus id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1"></minus><cn type="float" id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.2">0.9</cn></apply><apply id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1"><minus id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1"></minus><cn type="float" id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.2">0.8</cn></apply></matrixrow></matrix></apply><ci id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.2.2">𝖳</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1c">\begin{pmatrix}0.9&amp;0.8&amp;-0.9&amp;-0.8\end{pmatrix}^{\mathsf{T}}</annotation></semantics></math>, where each logit element represents the confidence that the input data belongs to a particular class.

This distance matrix houses the relational data of all logit elements within the logit vector with respect to others. Therefore, we can employ this matrix to evaluate the inter-class relevance present within the logit vector quantitatively. Specifically, the higher the score in the matrix, the greater the distance between the class represented by its row and the corresponding other class, and thus, the larger the gap.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p7.1" class="ltx_p">In order to compare our poisoning scheme with existing ones, we used this calculation to derive the poisoning scores and showcased the results in Fig. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ IV-D Discussion ‣ IV Attack Method Design ‣ Logit Poisoning Attack in Distillation-based Federated Learning and its Countermeasures" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>. The figure clearly indicates that the poisoning score for vectors tainted using our strategy is significantly higher than that of the existing schemes. Notably, the shuffling strategy in our plan is custom-tailored for each class based on statistical data. Moreover, the label-flipping attack essentially substitutes elements in the vector, which is why it can also cause a considerable poisoning effect on the similarity matrix. Nonetheless, our attack method utilizes a meticulously designed scheme to maximize this poisoning effect.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p8.2" class="ltx_p">Another angle from which we optimize the poisoning effect concerns the position of the maximum value in the logit vector. As we know, the maximum value in the model’s predictions signifies the predicted result. The gap between the data class symbolized by the position of the maximum value post-shuffling and the actual class profoundly affects the poisoning effect. Furthermore, the magnitude of the maximum value represents the model’s confidence in the outcome. Thus, the poisonous vector can not only misdirect the model trained with the data but also augment the influence on the model due to the value.

We measure the impact of poisoning by calculating the product of the difference in values at the maximum position and the distance. Similarly, the higher the poisoning score, the better the poisoning effect of the solution. We compare the poisoning score of our approach with that of the label-flipping attack and showcase the comparison in Fig. <a href="#S4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ IV-D Discussion ‣ IV Attack Method Design ‣ Logit Poisoning Attack in Distillation-based Federated Learning and its Countermeasures" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>. At this stage, we do not collect the poisoning score of the naive poisoning, as this technique rarely alters the position of the maximum value within the logit vector.

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We propose a robust aggregation algorithm specifically designed to defend distillation-based federated learning, aiming to guard against logit poisoning attacks. This novel aggregation method functions by identifying and subsequently discarding local logits that may be potentially malicious before computing the global logits in each iterative process. The general procedure of the proposed robust logit aggregation algorithm is shown in Alg. <a href="#alg3" title="Algorithm 3 ‣ V-A Proposed Defense Scheme ‣ V Toward Secure Distillation-based Federated Learning ‣ Logit Poisoning Attack in Distillation-based Federated Learning and its Countermeasures" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the initial phase, it computes the average logit vectors uploaded by each user and associated with the same class, thus calculating a representative vector for each class. The algorithm then needs to generate the corresponding aggregation weights tailored to each class. The algorithm employs spectral clustering <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite> to categorize the representative vectors that belong to identical classes. It is worth noting that our threat model assumes that the number of attackers constitutes less than 50% of the total. Hence, we operate under the assumption that the cluster with the largest size encompasses all benign logit vectors. Furthermore, we posit that the centroid of this dominant cluster represents the benign distribution. This clustering technique plays a crucial role in the algorithm’s efficacy, aiding in identifying potentially harmful entities and ensuring the integrity of the federated learning process.
Subsequently, the algorithm computes the average of all logit vectors within a cluster determined to be benign according to predefined criteria. This calculation then yields the distribution of benign logit vectors.</p>

When all logit vectors are aggregated at the end of the process, the average weight corresponding to each user is utilized. This structure ensures a balanced and robust aggregation, in alignment with our defensive approach against potential poisoning attacks. We utilize the weights computed to perform a weighted average of the logit vectors from all users. This weighted aggregation results in the derivation of the global logits, embodying collective intelligence and ensuring the integrity of the federated learning process.
In our approach, the incorporation of the softmax function with a temperature parameter serves as a mechanism to finely tune the sensitivity of the malicious logit vectors detection algorithm. Specifically, when the temperature is set to a value less than 1, the mathematical effect is to magnify the gap between the benign vector and the other logit vector. This enlargement of the gap translates to the algorithm assigning lower weights to vectors that are likely to be malicious. Conversely, when the temperature is set to a value greater than 1, the algorithm exhibits a higher tolerance for vectors that deviate from the benign distribution. This means that vectors differing from the benign distribution are assigned greater weights, reflecting a more permissive stance. Consequently, the temperature parameter provides a valuable tool for calibrating the detection threshold, allowing for nuanced control over the robustness of the federated learning process.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p2.4" class="ltx_p">Since poisonous logit vectors follow a different distribution compared to benign ones, they will generally be situated farther away from the majority of the logit vectors. As a vector becomes more effective at poisoning, its position in the space shifts farther away from the benign distribution. This movement exemplifies the increased divergence and assists in characterizing the malicious behavior within the data. Given that an attacker aims to maximize the poisoning effect produced by the poisonous logit vectors, it follows that:</p>

The dataset we use is MNIST <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>. The MNIST dataset is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used in the field of machine learning. The dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, each of which is a grayscale image of 28x28 pixels. These images represent handwritten digits from 0 to 9 and are labeled with the corresponding integer. We partition the dataset, allocating 65,000 samples as private user data and dividing them equally among the users. Out of these, 4,000 samples are designated as public datasets for knowledge transfer, while 1,000 samples are reserved as the test dataset to evaluate the model’s accuracy and loss.</p>

<p id="S6.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In our experiments, we investigate three distinct poisoning attack schemes: naive poisoning, label flipping poisoning, and our proposed logit poisoning attack. In the case of the label-flipping attack, the adversary alters the labels of the local training data in a specific manner to poison it. This label-flipping strategy is uniformly executed across all the malicious parties under the adversary’s control. Subsequently, these malicious parties employ the poisoned data to train their local models and share the corresponding updates with the central server. For the naive poisoning attack, the adversary is aware of the distribution of benign updates. The adversary then can introduce a malicious update by adding a significantly large vector to the benign distribution. It is essential to highlight that the naive poisoning attack necessitates the construction of a large vector, whereas, in our poisoning scheme, the logit vector must be scaled. To ensure a fair comparison, we constrain the magnitude of the large vector in the naive attack to align with the value range of the scaled vector in our logit vectors poisoning attack. This alignment is significant because our scheme only requires a relatively modest scaling factor, rendering the impact of the naive poisoning attack comparatively minimal.</p>

The first convolutional layer accepts an input shape of (28,28), utilizing filters with a kernel size of (3,3) and a stride of 1. A dropout rate <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite> of 0.2 is applied following this layer. The second convolutional layer employs filters with a kernel size of (2,2) and a stride of 2, again followed by a dropout rate of 0.2. The third convolutional layer uses filters with a kernel size of (3,3), a stride of 2, and the same dropout rate of 0.2. The Dense output layer consists of ten units and applies L2 regularization with a factor of 1e-3.

Each experiment is performed multiple times to acquire a robust set of trial findings, from which an average is calculated. The comparative results demonstrate that our approach exhibits superior performance to conventional poisoning schemes under equivalent value magnitudes. To more effectively illustrate the efficacy of our approach, we initially examined the influence of varying attacker proportions on model accuracy across three different distillation-based federated learning schemes. Subsequently, we fixed the proportion of attackers at 30% to evaluate the comparative performance of our attack scheme against both naive poisoning and label-flipping attacks under this condition.</p>

As illustrated in the corresponding figures, it is evident that, for the three distinct federated learning schemes, our poisoning attack scheme achieves a more pronounced poisoning effect when the proportion of attackers is set at 30%. Under these conditions, the accuracy of the three federated learning schemes on the test dataset substantially declines, while the loss concomitantly experiences a significant increase.
For the DS-FL scheme, its inherent entropy reduction algorithm mitigates the impact when the attackers constitute 10% and 20% of the total. However, our scheme proves successful when the attackers account for 30%. For the FedDF method, it is observed that the resistance to any attack scheme is notably robust. Specifically, all poisoning schemes inflict less damage to this approach. This resilience can be attributed to the scheme’s utilization of the softmax function on the logit vector and the execution of the knowledge transfer process on the server side. Nevertheless, our poisoning scheme is still able to achieve a satisfactory poisoning effect, leading to a reduction in the accuracy of the global model. Furthermore, the efficacy of our approach surpasses that of other poisoning schemes. Another noteworthy observation is the substantially reduced poisoning effects when implementing naive poisoning attacks compared to results in analogous studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. This discrepancy arises from our deliberate constraint on the vectors employed in naive poisoning attacks, aligning them within a similar value range to our poisoning schemes. This methodological decision ensures a fair and consistent comparison across the different approaches. Within this controlled value range, our scheme demonstrates a more effective poisoning effect, further emphasizing the superiority and efficacy of our proposed method.</p>

The sole distinction lies in the substitution of the aggregation algorithm within the three FL schemes with our newly proposed robust aggregation algorithm. By integrating the robust aggregation algorithm, we intend to forge a solution that exhibits enhanced security and resilience against poisoning attacks. We utilize the running results obtained with zero percent attackers as the baseline for comparison. The efficacy of the defense mechanism can be gauged by how closely the accuracy and loss metrics when under attack, align with those of the baseline group. In this instance, the settings and parameters for the attackers remain consistent with those delineated in the previous subsection. The percentage of attackers is set to 30%.</p>

Our defense scheme operates on the principle of abnormal logit vector filtering. Specifically, it detects the distribution of benign logit vectors, which are presumed to be in the majority, and assigns weights to each user. Because of this approach, our scheme is not limited to defending against our logit poisoning attack; it is also applicable to detecting and mitigating other poisoning attack schemes. We observe that, owing to the integration of our robust aggregation algorithm, all the considered schemes manifest a marked resistance to various poisoning attacks. The resultant test accuracy and loss metrics are significantly improved, aligning closely with the baseline curve. We are also encouraged to discover that for DS-FL, the test loss subsequent to the employment of our algorithm was lower than that of the baseline, while the accuracy was closely aligned with it.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper has unveiled a novel perspective on poisoning attacks within distillation-based federated learning, a complex issue that previously lacked a targeted approach. By analyzing the intrinsic properties of the logit vector, we developed an innovative two-stage scheme for executing logit poisoning attacks, successfully addressing prior limitations. Moreover, we introduced an efficient defense algorithm, estimating the benign logit vector’s distribution on each class and assigning weights according to similarity to the estimated benign distribution. The extensive experimentation has underlined both the substantial threat that the newly devised logit poisoning attack can pose and the robust efficacy of our defensive mechanism. Our research thus contributes valuable insights into both offensive and defensive strategies within the realm of distillation-based federated learning, offering new avenues for further exploration and development.</p>
