<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">Due to the distributed characteristics of Federated Learning (FL), the vulnerability of global model and coordination of devices are the main obstacle. As a promising solution of decentralization, scalability and security, leveraging blockchain in FL has attracted much attention in recent years. However, the traditional consensus mechanisms designed for blockchain like Proof of Work (PoW) would cause extreme resource consumption, which reduces the efficiency of FL greatly, especially when the participating devices are wireless and resource-limited. In order to address device asynchrony and anomaly detection in FL while avoiding the extra resource consumption caused by blockchain, this paper introduces a framework for empowering FL using Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based blockchain systematically (DAG-FL). Accordingly, DAG-FL is first introduced from a three-layer architecture in details, and then two algorithms <span id="id4.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DAG-FL Controlling</span> and <span id="id4.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DAG-FL Updating</span> are designed running on different nodes to elaborate the operation of DAG-FL consensus mechanism. After that, a Poisson process model is formulated to discuss that how to set deployment parameters to maintain DAG-FL stably in different federated learning tasks. The extensive simulations and experiments show that DAG-FL can achieve better performance in terms of training efficiency and model accuracy compared with the typical existing on-device federated learning systems as the benchmarks.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to solve the privacy problem caused by the data island and make the best use of distributed data on various devices, Federated Learning (FL) has recently drawn much attention, which is a distributed machine learning framework, and participants in FL transfer and communicate the model parameters without revealing user privacy to use their own data to establish machine learning models [<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet"><a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a></cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet"><a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a></cite>]. For wireless scenarios, on-device FL is one of the most typical applications where participating nodes of FL are numerous mobile devices under a wireless network [<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet"><a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a></cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet"><a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a></cite>]. Meanwhile, with the advent of 5G era, mobile devices would have sufficient communication bandwidth which makes it possible to establish an efficient FL system on mobile devices.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Although FL is widely considered to be a feasible way to enhance privacy and security in 5G wireless networks, it still faces many challenges during deployment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. The main two points are as follows.</p>

As a result, due to the limited capacity and ability of node, network and system, it is hard to coordinate FL process perfectly generating the device asynchrony <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. To this end, in the traditional centralized and synchronous FL system like Google FL proposed in 2017 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, a single node must wait for other nodes to complete their tasks and then enter the next round together after completing its own training task. However, this manner might generate the deteriorated cost incurred by the bottleneck node obviously, in which the worst case is that if a node shuts down during training, it may let a round of FL be invalid completely [<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet"><a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a></cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet"><a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a></cite>].</p>

Due to privacy concerns, the local data set and local operation process of a node are invisible to others, which makes FL suffer from abnormal actions of nodes easily. Especially considering massive participating nodes, the challenge of FL is to detect abnormal nodes and avoid adverse effects as much as possible. Abnormal nodes will reduce the overall efficiency of FL system as well as model accuracy by uploading abnormal parameters during the FL process, the machine learning model built by all nodes together would be very vulnerable, and thus anomaly detection in FL is necessary [<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet"><a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a></cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet"><a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a></cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet"><a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a></cite>].</p>

</ul>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To this end, some researches focus on asynchronous FL framework to solve device asynchrony, and anomaly detection strategy to mitigate the impact of abnormal nodes in FL system. Recently, considering the asynchronous system and security protection, blockchain becomes a natural design that adopted in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, the reasons are twofold. (1) Nodes can announce local model immediately without any asynchrony requirement. (2) Blockchain miners can collect and validate model parameters to encourage normal action while avoiding anomaly.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Although recent blockchained FL works [<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet"><a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a></cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet"><a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a></cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet"><a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a></cite>] have achieved some progress and advantages to address the mentioned challenges, there are still some problems remained that have not been investigated thoroughly.
First, although these works basically follow the synchronous framework of Google FL, they allow nodes not to wait for others. Thus a pseudo-asynchronous FL system is established, in which the innovation is to use miners to replace the central servers. However, due to the synchrony, the mobile device acted as a miner should be associated with each other, which obeys the decentralization of blockchain while declining the performance of FL in terms of delay, convergence, accuracy and etc. Second, to maintain the blockchain operation, most works use PoW <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> which allows node acted as a miner consuming an amount of computing resource for consensus achievement. Meanwhile, in order to detect abnormal nodes, the miner should also verify the correctness of uploaded model parameters. As a result, the training/learning efficiency might not meet the expectation well caused by the blockchain cost since the overall resource is limited, especially for on-device FL under wireless network.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Through the above observations, our concerned issue is whether blockchain is available to establish an efficient asynchronous on-device FL system without introducing too much extra resource consumption. Owing to the evolution of consensus mechanism, we notice that Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) ledger technology promotes blockchain from synchronous to asynchronous bookkeeping using voting consensus mechanism without mining <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Inspired by these, we propose an asynchronous DAG empowered FL for purpose of efficiency and immunity, referred as DAG-FL. The main contributions of this work are illustrated as follows.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FL is a distributed machine learning method to utilize data on different devices without privacy leaking, and it is proposed by Google in 2017 officially <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Traditional FL like Google FL is composed of a central server and numerous nodes as shown in Fig. <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ II-A Federated Learning ‣ II Preliminaries ‣ Towards On-Device Federated Learning: A Direct Acyclic Graph-based Blockchain Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.(a), where the global model is maintained on central server and FL iterations are performed on nodes. In every round of FL, the central server selects several idle nodes to assign FL tasks. The selected nodes then begin to run FL iterations. To complete an FL iteration, the node first downloads the current global model from the central server. Second, the node trains the global model using local data to get a local model and upload it to the central server. Finally, when the central server collects all local models uploaded by selected nodes, it runs the <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FederatedAveraging</span> algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> that combines all the local models on averaging to get an aggregated new global model. This global model updating method is a typical synchronous manner, and the traditional FL like Google FL is so-called synchronous FL.</p>

Nodes in pseudo-asynchronous can download global model from the central server and train it with local data whenever it is in idle state. The central server will update the global model regularly by aggregating the newly uploaded local models in the cache.

In asynchronous FL, it only needs two steps to complete an iteration of FL. First, any node can download the global model from the central server whenever it is idle, and train the global model to get a local model. Then, the node uploads the local model back to the central server, and the central server updates the global model immediately whenever the local model is collected <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> as shown in Fig. <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ II-A Federated Learning ‣ II Preliminaries ‣ Towards On-Device Federated Learning: A Direct Acyclic Graph-based Blockchain Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.(c).

Usually, the traditional blockchain is based on Proof of X (the most famous one is Proof of Work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>), which consumes much resource on solving hash problems to decide which block to add to the chain next while slowing down the access rate of new blocks to avoid fork problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. Moreover, the RAFT-based blockchain does not tolerate the existence of malicious nodes and PBFT-blockchain meets the challenge of communication overhead increasing with the participating nodes exponentially <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In order to break the above limitations, DAG-based blockchain (DAG ledger) is proposed to promote the synchronous blockchain to asynchronous bookkeeping. The principle of DAG-based blockchain is to attach the new transactions in a forking topology <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> without maintaining a main chain, and thus any new arrival transaction can be recorded in blockchain immediately without any coordination <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. The consensus used in DAG-based blockchain can be treated as a voting mechanism, which requires nodes to validate and approve some early published transactions before publishing their owns. The interval between publishing time of a transaction and current time is called staleness. Transactions with good staleness that are not approved yet on DAG are usually called as tips <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. To publish a transaction on DAG, one node needs to go through three stages. In the first stage, the node selects some tips according to some algorithms or just randomly. In the second stage, the node validates the authentication and correctness of selected tips. In the final stage, a new transaction, composed of essential information and approvals to selected tips, is constructed and published on DAG. Through these three stages, the votes are stored in the published transactions, and unidirectional connections among transactions are built forming the DAG architecture through the approval relationship.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Application layer is deployed on the top of DAG-FL, which provides the interface to external agents by running smart contracts. Through the smart contract, external agents can release FL task to nodes, observe FL process, and obtain the target model as soon as FL is completed. When a specific FL task is released according to a smart contract, nodes in DAG layer can participate in this work based on an incentive mechanism to gain an amount of reward <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Accordingly, the application layer provides an interface for external agents to deploy DAG-FL easily, the DAG and FL layer form an asynchronous platform for FL. Nodes with device asynchrony like smart phones and IoT devices in DAG-FL all need to maintain a local DAG to record transactions published by every node. The local DAG on each node is updated by communicating with adjacent nodes periodically, and thus newly published transactions can be seen by all nodes. As there is no central server in DAG-FL, one node in DAG-FL constructs a global model from its local DAG to iterate FL instead of requiring a global model from the central server. This feature promises that a node in DAG-FL can immediately participate in an iteration of FL whenever it is in idle state. When the node completes an iteration of FL and gets a new trained local model, the new local model can be published on its local DAG as a transaction immediately, and latter the new published transaction would be seen by all other nodes. In this manner, the operation of any node cannot affect the state of other nodes, which would satisfy the asynchrony of mobile devices.

<div id="S3.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Traditional blockchained FLs often use miners to update the blockchain by running the consensus mechanism like PoW, enabling every node to observe transactions published on blockchain. Similarly, as there are no miners in DAG-FL, each node in DAG-FL should both perform FL tasks and update the DAG by running the DAG-FL consensus. Based on the voting mechanism of DAG ledger technology, DAG-FL consensus approves the nodes by validating both the authentication and local model correctness of tips. The authentication of transactions can be validated by cryptography technology like RSA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> in blockchain fields, and the local model can be simply validated by computing the accuracy with a test set formed by the local data. By authenticating transactions, nodes in DAG-FL can avoid transaction impersonation attacks. Furthermore, adversaries doing Sybil attacks that aim to flood the network could not impersonate other normal nodes to publish crafted transactions, which makes adversaries easy to be detected and punished. Whenever a node in DAG-FL performs one iteration of FL, it runs DAG-FL consensus and should first choose some tips on its local DAG to validate. Authenticated transactions with higher accuracy of local models would be chosen to construct the global model. The node then uses local data set to train the global model to get a local model. Finally, a new transaction that contains the newly trained local model is published and approves the tips which are used to construct the global model. Unlike the PoW consensus in other blockchained FL systems which consumes resource on solving hash cryptography problems, DAG-FL consensus avoids the extra consumption of resource unrelated to FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">DAG-FL consensus combines the voting mechanism of DAG ledger technology with the process of local model validation in FL, which can effectively detect abnormal nodes and mitigate their impact on FL. With the continuous extension of transactions on DAG, every approval of a transaction means that the local model on the approved transaction is selected to form a global model and influences the target model co-construction of FL. Consequently, the more approvals a transaction get, the greater impact it will have on FL, otherwise it will be isolated and has less impact on FL. Due to this unique consensus, the machine learning model in DAG-FL is always trained towards the direction that most nodes expect, and we assume that most nodes in DAG-FL are normal nodes while only a few nodes are abnormal. Abnormal transactions published by abnormal nodes usually have less prediction accuracy on test set than that of transactions published by normal nodes. Thus, compared with normal ones, the probability of abnormal transactions being approved by subsequent published transactions is much smaller. During the process of FL, abnormal transactions are isolated and their impact is minimized. In addition, nodes with too many isolated transactions can be detected by the DAG-FL as abnormal nodes, and then DAG-FL can react to these abnormal nodes.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.SSS4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">As DAG-FL is a completely decentralized asynchronous FL system without any central server, a global model can only be temporarily constructed from the local DAG. Thus, DAG-FL allows nodes with different global models to train at the same time during the FL process. Global models differ a lot from each other in the early stage of FL, which causes a low convergence rate of the target model. However, these temporarily constructed global models tend to be almost the same in the later stage of FL, which promises an impressive convergence rate just as classic asynchronous FL.</p>

If a node uses local data set to train a global model constructed by tips with bad staleness and gets a local model, the new transaction which contains the trained local model is more likely to be isolated on DAG. These isolated transactions published by normal nodes are not conducive to the machine learning model convergence, and significantly slow down the establishment of the target model of FL.

The MNIST dataset of handwritten digits has a training set of 60,000 samples and a test set of 10,000 samples. To reflect the non-IID feature of local data on mobile devices, we design a special scheme to distribute training data to every node. At first, we sort 2/3 training set by digit label, divide it into 200 shards of size 200, and assign each of 100 nodes 2 shards. Then, the remained training set is equally assigned to 100 nodes. By using this data distributing scheme, each node is assigned a local data set including most samples of two exact digits and some samples of the other digits. In addition, the learning rate of this CNN model is set to be 0.002 and the loss function is cross-entropy.</p>

The LSTM model takes a series of characters with a length of 80 as input and embeds each of these into a learned 8-dimensional space. The embedded characters are then processed through 2 LSTM layers, each of which has 256 nodes. Finally, a softmax output layer is connected to the second LSTM layer with one node per character. The Shakespeare dataset is split into a train set with 3564579 characters and a test set with 870014 characters. As the Shakespeare dataset itself is composed of 1146 roles’ speakings, which is already highly unbalanced, the non-IID feature of local data is realized by randomly assigning the training set to 100 nodes. The LSTM model uses the cross-entropy loss function and is set with a learning rate of 0.3. To better compare the convergence difference among FLs in the following simulation experiments, the LSTM model has been pre-trained to achieve an accuracy of 0.2518.</p>

Lazy nodes upload existing models instead of models trained with local data in an FL iteration, aiming to obtain potential rewards of FL. Poisoning nodes are set to have wrong data for training, which can poison the global model in FL and aim at reducing the overall target model performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Backdoor nodes are those that do targeted attacks (also called backdoor attacks) and aim to mislead the target model in FL. As the LSTM model using Shakespeare dataset is vulnerable to targeted attacks, backdoor nodes are only concerned in CNN task. For the CNN task in our pySimuFL, backdoor nodes modify part of their local MNIST pictures by replacing a 5x5 white square into the upper left corner <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> and want to mislead the final target model of FL to recognize pictures with a white square to the wrong digit label which is the true digit plus one.</p>

To compare the performance differences of the several FL systems fairly, some settings of Google FL, Asynchronous FL, and Block FL are presented as follows. For Google FL, in each round, ten nodes in idle state are selected to download and train the global model from the central server, which means Google FL will run ten iterations in a round. Asynchronous FL used in pySimuFL updates the global model by averaging the last global model with newly uploaded local model. And for iteration process of Block FL, we set up 100 nodes and 5 extra miners. The 100 nodes in Block FL are divided into 5 groups and each group is associated with a miner. Every miner has the whole test data set (10000 picture samples for CNN task and 10740 80-length character line samples for LSTM task) to validate published transactions. Whenever a miner collects 5 transactions published by nodes or waits over 10s, it runs PoW consensus mechanism to win the right to publish the next block (where the global model stores) into blockchain. We ignore the fork problem of Block FL, and set up a small difficulty for PoW which in average costs miner 5s to solve a hash cryptography problem. The average time consumption per 100 iterations for the four FLs is shown in Table II.</p>

For CNN task, DAG-FL and Block FL have nearly the same convergence rates and have lower accuracy than Google FL and Asynchronous FL at the first 5000 iterations. This is because that Google FL and Asynchronous FL can promise an equal frequency for data on each node to be used. For LSTM task, Asynchronous FL and DAG-FL have better convergence rates than the synchronous Google FL and pseudo-asynchronous Block FL at the first 5000 iterations, and Asynchronous FL performs better than DAG-FL because it ensures the average use of data. Considering the iteration latency of the four FLs in Table. II, DAG-FL and asynchronous FL can complete much more FL iterations than Google FL and Block FL after the same time. When time comes to 10000s, in CNN task, all the four FLs can train a target model that achieves the accuracy around 0.982. And in LSTM task, DAG-FL and Asynchronous FL can get target models with an accuracy of 0.552 while the other two FLs can only get final target models with the accuracy below 0.548. Through comprehensive consideration of the convergence rate and average iteration latency, we conclude that DAG-FL is an efficient FL system and can train a final target model with good accuracy.</p>

We find that a small number of lazy nodes in Google FL and Asynchronous FL can help the global model avoid sharp updating during the FL process. Thus, these two FLs still have good convergence rates when 20 percent lazy nodes are involved for both CNN and LSTM tasks. It can be observed that Block FL is significantly affected by the participation of lazy nodes in terms of the convergence rate and the accuracy. Compared with the accuracy at 5000 iterations in the ideal case, Block FL loses about 0.02 accuracy in CNN task and about 0.04 accuracy in LSTM task when 20 lazy nodes are involved. The reason is that with more associated lazy nodes, the miner in Block FL usually has more time to run PoW to win the right to publish the next block. This means that more transactions published by normal nodes are dropped instead of being adopted for the global model updating.</p>

We can see that accuracy of Google FL and Asychronous FL significantly reduces when poisoning nodes are involved, this is due to the fact that Google FL and Asychronous FL are not capable of distinguishing poisoning nodes. In contrast, these two FLs can only use the average algorithm to dilute the harmful model parameters uploaded by poisoning nodes, so as to achieve the purpose of mitigation. Since there are multiple miners to verify the model parameters uploaded by the associated nodes, the accuracy of Block FL does not decline much when poisoning nodes participate. DAG-FL performs best among the four FLs when poisoning nodes are involved in both CNN and LSTM tasks. The reason is that in the process of FL of DAG-FL, each node will validate the published transactions through the unique voting consensus mechanism. As a result, the transactions published by poisoning nodes will be isolated on DAG with the progress of FL, so as to mitigate the impact of poisoning nodes.</p>

It can be seen that all the four FLs have good convergence rates and accuracy similar to running in the ideal case. Block FL has a higher detection rate for models uploaded by backdoor nodes than DAG-FL because miners in Block FL use the whole test data set to validate models. This causes Block FL to perform better than DAG-FL in the first 5000 iterations when backdoor nodes are concerned. At 5000 iterations, the success rates of targeted attacks are computed for the four FLs as shown in Table III. The immunity of DAG-FL to targeted attacks is sensitive to the number of backdoor nodes. DAG-FL can well resist targeted attacks with an attack success rate of 0.006 when only 5 backdoor nodes are involved. When 20 backdoor nodes are involved, DAG-FL and Block FL perform similar immunity to targeted attacks, while Google FL and Block FL are completely captured with attack success rates above 0.9.</p>

This is because that temporarily constructed global models differ a lot from each other in the early stage. In the middle stage, different global models tend to integrate with each other, resulting in a sharp increase in the convergence rate of DAG-FL. Moreover, DAG-FL on 5 nodes have more training data to build CNN model, so as to achieve higher accuracy. In such an implementation experiment, we can conclude that DAG-FL can operate effectively in real situation, and achieve a good performance when building a CNN model.</p>

These systems usually allow central server to maintain a unique global model and assign FL tasks to some nodes that are in idle state in each round of FL. Before beginning another new round, the central server should wait for every selected nodes to complete their assigned FL tasks. This synchronous updating method promises a simple structure for FL and easy to implement, but errors on any node can block synchronous FL, resulting in poor tolerance of fault. In addition, the central server needs to upload and download models frequently, and is also responsible for maintaining entire network structure of FL. Thus, the scalability of synchronous FL is limited by the communication bandwidth and computing capacity of the central server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S7.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Based on synchronous FL, researchers construct the pseudo-asynchronous FL to allow nodes doing FL iterations freely. Nodes in a pseudo-asynchronous FL system can download the global model from the central server at any time, and immediately upload their trained local models to a cache. The central server regularly updates its global model by aggregating trained local models from the latest global models in the cache. In order to improve the system efficiency, the interval between the global model updating should be set small, and bottleneck nodes usually cannot upload their trained local models in time. This causes meaningful data on bottleneck nodes are hard to utilize, which violates the original intention of making full use of the data on each node in FL. By redesigning nodes selection and global model aggregation methods, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> have established a pseudo-asynchronous FL system that can utilize data on bottleneck nodes.

<p id="S7.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">It is noted that FL and blockchain technology are both deployed in a distributed network, many researchers attempt to combine the advantages of them and have proposed some influential blockchained FL systems [<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet"><a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a></cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet"><a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a></cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet"><a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a></cite>]. Combining blockchain and FL, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> propose a DeepChain architecture. This work focuses on solving the problems of privacy and auditability by storing the local machine learning model in blockchain and regarding these models as transactions, which uses the security and immunity of blockchain to prevent nodes without permission from accessing information stored in transactions. Similarly, in order to store sensitive and personal data in a diskless environment, research like <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> adopts blockchain to form a data sharing platform which is beneficial for data privacy and security. On this basis, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> utilize a sharding-based blockchain protocol to well protect the convergence of FL when large-scale nodes are involved. Furthermore, researchers in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> also propose a sharding-based FL system by applying a two-layer blockchain framework.</p>

<div id="S7.SS4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In recent works [<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet"><a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a></cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet"><a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a></cite>], researchers are interested in a deep combination of blockchain and FL and get more suitable models for on-device scenarios or other. Both of the works use the miner in blockchain to complete the task of the central server in traditional FL. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> design a Block FL with multiple miners to coordinate FL tasks and maintain the global model, and the procedure can be described as follows: 1) The node downloads the global model from its associated miner and get a trained local model. 2) The trained local model will be uploaded to the associated miner as a transaction. 3) The miner will confirm the validity of the uploaded transaction, and the confirmed transactions will be stored in the candidate block of the miner. Once candidate blocks collect enough transactions or wait for a certain time, all miners enter the consensus stage together and run PoW to compete for a winner to publish its own candidate block on the blockchain. Besides, miners are capable of allocating rewards when publishing their blocks on blockchain to motivate mobile devices to participate in FL. Followed up the work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> propose a FLchain architecture that considers MEC servers as miners to solve problems brought by central servers in traditional FLs. The FL systems in these two works are more like the pseudo-asynchronous ones, in which nodes are freed after uploading local trained models to miners. Compared with only using blockchain to store and transmit information, works like [<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet"><a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a></cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet"><a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a></cite>] provide a feasible way to achieve efficient fusion of blockchain and FL in terms of data security and privacy.</p>

<div id="S7.SS4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, these previous works still remain issues to be addressed on both blockchain and FL. On the one hand, these works insist on the PoX consensus mechanism, which naturally leads to the pseudo-asynchronous framework that cannot meet the device asynchrony in on-device FL. Besides, the introduced miners would generate extra delay and resource consumption on consensus but not for FL at all. On the other hand, these works rely on miners to validate uploaded local models stored in transactions, which might cause miner’s dilemma due to the conflict of interest between blockchain and FL. As the transaction validation is executed on miners, the target model might be trained towards the expected direction of miners instead of nodes, resulting in the problem of local optima.</p>

<p id="S7.SS4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To this end, for asynchronous bookkeeping and low resource consumption of DAG ledger technology, this paper proposes DAG-FL introducing DAG empowers asynchronous FL framework. Through the workload assign of consensus and model validation on each node in a decentralized manner, miners and mining are not needed anymore. By combining the voting mechanism of DAG ledger technology with the process of local model validation in FL, DAG-FL can detect abnormal nodes and mitigate their impact autonomously to guarantee security. Meanwhile, as the model validation is operated on each node without professional miners, the target model of FL would be trained under the observation of all nodes avoiding the training deviation for any reason.</p>

<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed a DAG empowered FL system named as DAG-FL, which combines DAG ledger technology to overcome the problems of mobile device asynchrony and abnormal nodes to complete the model co-construction task of FL efficiently. DAG-FL is constructed by a three-layer asynchronous architecture including FL, DAG, and application layers taking the responsibilities of model training, communicating and observing. In this manner, DAG layer could provide blockchain as a service (BaaS) establishing <span id="S8.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DAG-FL controlling</span> and <span id="S8.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DAG-FL updating</span> algorithms for operation process of DAG-FL. Meanwhile, to maintain the stability and efficiency of DAG-FL, we discussed two deployment details explaining how to keep the reasonable number of tips on DAG and how to address the staleness of FL results. Finally, experimental results showed that DAG-FL has the higher system efficiency and a better target model with device asynchrony compared with other three benchmark FL systems. Meanwhile, DAG-FL is also proved to be insensitive to the impact of abnormal nodes and has the ability of anomaly detection. Moreover, the results on the testbed where DAG-FL can also achieve the high stability and efficiency as expected. To provide some open discussion issues to extend DAG-FL, we highlighted the concerns on model validation, credit evaluation and weighted aggregation as the possible future direction.</p>
