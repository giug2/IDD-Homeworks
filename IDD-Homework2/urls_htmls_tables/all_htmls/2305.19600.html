<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm that enables clients to jointly train a global model by aggregating the locally trained models without sharing any local training data. In practice, there can often be substantial heterogeneity (e.g., class imbalance) across the local data distributions observed by each of these clients. Under such non-iid data distributions across clients, FL suffers from the ‘client-drift’ problem where every client drifts to its own local optimum. This results in slower convergence and poor performance of the aggregated model. To address this limitation, we propose a novel regularization technique based on adaptive self-distillation (<span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ASD</span>) for training models on the client side. Our regularization scheme adaptively adjusts to the client’s training data based on the global model entropy and the client’s label distribution. The proposed regularization can be easily integrated atop existing, state-of-the-art FL algorithms, leading to a further boost in the performance of these off-the-shelf methods. We theoretically explain how ASD reduces client-drift and also explain its generalization ability. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through extensive experiments on multiple real-world benchmarks and show substantial gains in performance over state-of-the-art methods. The code is provided in the supplementary.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning method where the clients learn a shared model under the orchestration of the server without sharing the client’s data. Due to its privacy-preserving nature, it has many applications in smartphones <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Hard et al., <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Ramaswamy et al., <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>, the Internet of Things (IoT), healthcare organizations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Rieke et al., <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Xu et al., <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, etc. where training data is generated at edge devices or from privacy-sensitive domains. As originally introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al., <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>, FL involves model training across a distributed system consisting of one server and multiple clients.
In traditional FL, each client securely holds its training data,
due to privacy concerns and to avoid large communication
overheads if transmitting it externally. At the same
time, these clients aim to collaboratively train a generalized
model that can leverage the entirety of the training data disjointly
distributed across clients.</p>

<figcaption class="ltx_caption ltx_centering"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_figure">Figure 1: </span>Impact of local learning on the test accuracy with CIFAR-10. The effect of local learning on test accuracy is assessed by plotting the accuracy difference before and after local training (line). Positive values indicate an improvement in model accuracy post-training. It is clear that in cases where the label distribution (bar) is sparse, models experience a decline in accuracy after local training. However, our proposed adaptive self-distillation method not only preserves knowledge on imbalanced classes but also effectively learns from classes with over-representation.</figcaption>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Data generated at the edge/client devices are often highly heterogeneous, as a consequence of the data generation process. They can differ in terms of quantity imbalance (the number of samples with each client), label imbalance (empirical label distribution across the clients), and feature imbalance (features of the data across the clients are non-iid). When there exists a label or feature imbalance, the training objective for every client becomes different as the local minimum for every client will be different. In such settings, during the local training, the client’s model starts to drift towards its local minimum and farther away from the global objective. This is undesirable as the goal of the FL is to converge to a global model that generalizes well across all the clients. This phenomenon, known as ‘client-drift’, is introduced and explored in earlier works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Karimireddy et al., <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Acar et al., <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Wang et al., <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. Due to this, client models tend to forget the knowledge of the global model and overfit to their local data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">One popular way of mitigating this challenge
of label imbalance across clients is via client-side regularization. Here, the local model trained by the client is explicitly regularized with the global model parameters to minimize client drift. Algorithms such as FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, SCAFFOLD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Karimireddy et al., <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, and FedDyn <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Acar et al., <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> use regularization at the client-side in the parameter space. However, they ignore the representations of the global model, which can be useful and are explored in recent distillation-based works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(He et al., <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022b</a>; Lee et al., <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. The primary motivation behind distillation and regularization for FL is to allow the global model to have better representations than the local models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Recently <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(He et al., <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022b</a>)</cite> introduced the class-wise adaptive weighting scheme FedCAD at the server side. Its major drawback is that it assumes the presence of related auxiliary data on the server in a reliable manner for computing the adaptive class-wise weights.
Another work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lee et al., <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> proposes FedNTD which analyses the case of distilling only the incorrect class labels. The key issue with the existing distillation works is that they cannot explain how the generalization ability of the global model is improved.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To address these issues, motivated by client model regularization in mitigating client drift and to remove dependency on the server for computing client-side weights, we introduce an efficient strategy known as <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Adaptive Self-Distillation (ASD)</span> for Federated Learning. Importantly, ASD does not require any auxiliary data. We use the KL divergence between the global and local models as the regularizer, and the per-sample weights for the regularizer are adaptively adjusted based on the global model entropy and the empirical label distribution of the client’s data. In Fig <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Adaptive Self-Distillation for Minimizing Client Drift in Heterogeneous Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, we analyze the impact of client-drift by observing one round of local training on a particular client model with the CIFAR-10 dataset. We see that the performance of FedAvg on the labels that have sparse or no representation in its data is substantially deteriorates. However, after adding the ASD loss this impact is reduced. ASD performs the best in terms of local learning and preserving the global model knowledge on the sparse classes. <span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Later, we theoretically explain the client-drift reduction through our proposed ASD regularizer. In addition, we also provide justification that ASD leads to the generalized global model.</span>
This novel design of our proposed method can be easily integrated over any existing FL methods to result in substantial performance gain, which makes it an attractive and compelling solution to the federated learning problem. As a validation, we combine our proposed regularization scheme with algorithms such as FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al., <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>, FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, FedDyn <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Acar et al., <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> FedSpeed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Sun et al., <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>, FedNTD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lee et al., <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>,

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent times, addressing non-iid problems in Federated Learning has become an active area of research, and the field is developing rapidly. For brevity, we discuss a few related works here. In FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al., <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>, the two main challenges explored are reducing communication costs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yadav &amp; Yadav, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite> and ensuring privacy by avoiding having to share the data. There are some studies based on gradient inversion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Geiping et al., <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> raising privacy concerns owing to gradient sharing while others have proposed in defense of sharing the gradients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kairouz et al., <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Huang et al., <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>.
FedAvg is the generalization of local SGD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Stich, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> by increasing the number of local updates. It significantly reduces the communication costs in an iid setting, but does not give similar improvements for non-iid data. FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> introduces a proximal term by penalizing the weights if they are far from the global initialized model. SCAFFOLD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Karimireddy et al., <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> viewes this problem as one of objective inconsistency and introduces a gradient correction term that acts as a regularizer. Later, FedDyn <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Acar et al., <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> improves upon this by introducing the dynamic regularization term. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhang et al., <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> attempts to solve this problem by enabling all device participation or none, as described by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Acar et al., <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. Several papers perform an SGD-type analysis that involves the full device participation, and this breaks the important constraint in FL setup of partial device participation. Some of these attempt to compress the models to reduce the communication cost <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Mishchenko et al., <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. A few works include regularization methods on the client side <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhu et al., <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, and one-shot methods where clients send the condensed data and the server trains on the condensed data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhou et al., <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Hsu et al., <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, an adaptive weighting scheme is considered on task-specific loss to minimize the learning from samples whose representation is negligible. Flatness-based methods based on SAM called as FedSAM is introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Qu et al., <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Caldarola et al., <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>.</p>

Self-distillation was introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhang et al., <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> where the student distills from the same model to the sub-networks of the model. The teacher model’s predictions are updated every batch. In our method, distillation happens with the full network, and the teacher’s predictions are updated after every communication round.
Adaptive distillation was used in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Tang et al., <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. The server-side KD methods such as FedGen <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Seo et al., <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> use KD to train the generator at the server and the generator is broadcasted to the clients in the subsequent round. The clients use the generator to generate the data to provide the inductive bias. This method incurs extra communication of generator parameters along with the model and training of the generator in general is difficult. In FedDF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lin et al., <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> KD is used at the server that relies on the external data. The KD is performed on an ensemble of client models, especially client models acts as multiple teacher models and the knowledge is distilled into a single student model, which is a global model.
In FedNTD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lee et al., <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> the non-true class logits are used for distillation. This method gives uniform weight to all the samples.
In FedCAD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(He et al., <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022b</a>)</cite> and FedSSD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(He et al., <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022a</a>)</cite> the client-drift problem is posed as a forgetting problem, and a weighting scheme has been proposed. Importantly, the weights are assisted by the server with the assumption that the server has access to auxiliary data. One of its shortcomings is the availability of auxiliary data on the server, which may not hold.
In  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhang et al., <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> logits were calibrated based on the label distribution. This is totally different from our approach as we are adjusting the weights of the distillation loss.
Unlike all of these approaches, we propose a novel adaptive distillation strategy that aims to mitigate the challenge of client drift due to non-iid data without relying on the server and access to any form of auxiliary data to compute the adaptive weights.</p>

<div id="S3.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS4.p1.10" class="ltx_p">The key reason for better generalization is the adaptive self-distillation loss. It has been shown in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Mobahi et al., <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> that self-distillation improves the generalization in centralized settings. It has also been empirically shown in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhang et al., <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> that self-distillation helps the model to converge to a flat minimum. Generally, converging to flat minimum is indicative of improved generalization, a concept explored in prior studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Keskar et al., <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>; Yao et al., <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. The top eigenvalue and the trace of the Hessian computed from the training loss are typical measures of ‘flatness’ of the minimum to which the training converges, i.e., lower values of these measures indicate the presence of a flat minimum.
To gain a deeper understanding of this phenomenon in a federated learning setting, we analyze the top eigenvalue and the trace of the Hessian of the cross-entropy loss for global models obtained with and without the ASD regularizer. The following argument establishes that if the client models converge to flat minimum, it would also ensure convergence of the resultant global model to a flat minimum.

Thus when the local models converge to a flat minimum, it will ensure the convergence of the global model to a flat minimum.
Following the method of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yao et al., <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, we computed the top eigenvalue and trace of the Hessian. In Table <a href="#S3.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 3.4 Discussion on the Generalization of ASD ‣ 3 Method ‣ Adaptive Self-Distillation for Minimizing Client Drift in Heterogeneous Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, we observe that FedAvg+ASD attains lower values for the top eigenvalue and trace compared to FedAvg, suggesting convergence to flat minimum. The Eigen density plot in the figure <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 3.4 Discussion on the Generalization of ASD ‣ 3 Method ‣ Adaptive Self-Distillation for Minimizing Client Drift in Heterogeneous Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> also confirms the same. A similar concept has been explored in FedSAM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Qu et al., <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Caldarola et al., <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. But the issue with SAM-based methods is that they require an extra forward and backward pass which doubles the computation cost of the edge devices. However, our method can be applied to SAM-based methods and further improve its performance. ASD consistently attains the flatness with the other FL algorithms and enhances their generalization, these are described in Section <a href="#A8" title="Appendix H Hessian Analysis ‣ Adaptive Self-Distillation for Minimizing Client Drift in Heterogeneous Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">H</span></a> of the Appendix.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.7" class="ltx_p">For evaluation, we report accuracy on the test dataset as our performance metric and the number of communication rounds required to attain the desired accuracy as a metric to quantify the communication cost. Specifically, we evaluate the global model on the test set and report its accuracy after every communication round. For comparison, we consider the popular methods for federated learning such as FedAvg, FedProx, FedDyn, FedSpeed FedNTD,
FedSAM and
FedDisco. We augment each of these methods with our approach (ASD)
and observe a significant boost in performance. For a fair comparison, we consider the same models used in Fedavg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al., <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>, and FedDyn <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Acar et al., <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 classification tasks.

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We presented an efficient and effective method for addressing data heterogeneity due to label imbalance in Federated learning using Adaptive Self-Distillation (<span id="S7.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ASD</span>), which does not require any auxiliary data and no extra communication cost. We also theoretically showed that ASD has lower client-drift leading to better convergence. Moreover, we also performed analysis to show that ASD has better generalization by analyzing Hessian’s top eigenvalue and trace. The effectiveness of our approach is shown via extensive experiments across datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet with different degrees of heterogeneity. Our proposed approach to ASD can be integrated easily into any of the FL frameworks. We showed its efficacy by improving the performance when combined with FedAvg, FedProx, FedDyn, FedSAM, FedDisco, FedNTD and FedSpeed. Our research can inspire the designing of the regularizers that concurrently reduce client-drift and improve the generalization.</p>
