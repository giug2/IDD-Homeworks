<p id="id10.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) enables multiple devices to collaboratively train a shared model while preserving data privacy. Existing FL approaches usually assume that the global model can be trained on any participating devices. However, in real-world cases, a large memory footprint during the training process
bottlenecks the deployment on memory-constrained devices. This paper presents <span id="id10.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">ProFL</span>, a novel progressive FL framework to effectively break the memory wall. Specifically, ProFL divides the model into different blocks based on its original architecture. Instead of updating the full model in each training round, ProFL first trains the front blocks and safely freezes them after convergence. Training of the next block is then triggered. This process iterates until the training of the whole model is completed. In this way, the memory footprint is effectively reduced for feasible deployment on heterogeneous devices. In order to preserve the feature representation of each block, we decouple the whole training process into two stages: progressive model shrinking and progressive model growing. During the progressive model shrinking stage, we meticulously design corresponding output modules to assist each block in learning the expected feature representation and obtain the initialization parameters. Then, the obtained output modules are utilized in the corresponding progressive model growing stage. Additionally, to control the training pace for each block, a novel metric from the scalar perspective is proposed to assess the learning status of each block and determines when to trigger the training of the next one. Finally, we theoretically prove the convergence of ProFL and conduct extensive experiments on representative models and datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of ProFL. The results demonstrate that ProFL effectively reduces the peak memory footprint by up to 57.4% and improves model accuracy by up to 82.4%.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is a new learning paradigm that enables multiple devices to collaboratively train a global model while preserving data privacy. Most existing algorithms operate under the assumption that the participating devices possess sufficient memory capacity to train the global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(tian2022harmony, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>)</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(wang2023fedins2, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>)</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(mcmahan2017communication, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>)</cite>. However, in real-world scenarios, the participating clients, such as smartphones and wearable devices, usually have limited resources. For instance, training ResNet50 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(he2016deep, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>)</cite> on ImageNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(deng2009imagenet, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>)</cite> with a batch size of 128 requires 26GB of memory. On the contrary, the available memory on the commonly used mobile devices typically only ranges from 4 to 16GB <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(memory_ram, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>)</cite>. Moreover, to obtain high analysis capability, current models are becoming deeper and wider, leading to an even higher memory footprint. Such constraint prevents the deployment of FL on mobile devices in real-world cases. On the other hand, only training the small model that can fit the existing devices leads to low model representation capability and limits the application scope of FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To surmount the resource limitation of the participating devices, several works have been proposed. The existing work can be mainly divided into the following two categories: 1) model-heterogeneous FL and 2) partial training. The approaches in the first category employ the local model tailored to match the memory capacity of each participating device <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(li2019fedmd, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>)</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(itahara2021distillation, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>)</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(cho2022heterogeneous, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>)</cite>. Knowledge distillation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(hinton2015distilling, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>)</cite> is then performed for model aggregation. However, a public dataset is required to complete the information transfer between different model architectures, which is usually hard to retrieve due to privacy concerns in real-world cases. For the second category, the methods include both width scaling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(diao2020heterofl, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>)</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(alam2022fedrolex, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>)</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(horvath2021fjord, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>)</cite> and depth scaling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(kim2022depthfl, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>)</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(liu2022no, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>)</cite>.
For width scaling, the corresponding approach scales the channels of convolutional layers to resize the model size, thus accommodating clients’ available memory capacity. However, this approach substantially compromises the model’s architecture and introduces challenges related to channel mismatch during aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(kim2022depthfl, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>)</cite>, thus struggling to effectively leverage information from low-memory devices. For depth scaling, clients can train models of different depths based on their memory constraints. However, this method has a strong assumption that some of the participating clients can afford to train the full model during the local training process. The models that can be trained are still bounded by the high-end devices. Thus, a new training paradigm that can effectively break through the memory limitation of the participating devices to conduct high-performance training without a public dataset is crucial for FL in real-world deployment.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose ProFL, a novel progressive training approach that breaks the memory wall of FL from a new perspective. Unlike vanilla Federated Learning, which continuously updates the full model throughout the whole learning process, ProFL employs a well-designed progressive training paradigm, training only a portion of the model in each round and progressively completing the training of the full model. First, it divides the model into different blocks, allowing clients who can afford the training of the current block to participate. Then, when the current block converges, this block is frozen, and a new block is added for training on top of it. In this way, the backpropagation process of the frozen part and the corresponding memory space for storing the intermediate activations are effectively saved. This process iterates continuously until all blocks have been successfully trained. As the memory footprint during the training process is notably reduced, devices with heterogeneous hardware configurations can be involved in the training procedure.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">ProFL mainly consists of the following two stages: 1) progressive model shrinking and 2) progressive model growing.
Progressive model shrinking is designed to construct corresponding output modules and acquire the initialization parameters for each block. During the training process of each block, except for the last block, which has an output module for end-to-end training, the other blocks lack the ability to undergo independent training. Simply adding a fully connected layer can severely compromise the feature representation of each block, as each block aims to extract different levels of features in the original model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(chen2022layer, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>)</cite>. To tackle this challenge, we utilize convolutional layers to replace each subsequent block, mimicking the position of the training block in the original model and preserving their position information. Specifically, we first train each block of the model from back to front and integrate the trained block information into a convolutional layer. Through this process, we obtain convolutional layers carrying block-specific information for building output modules. At the same time, we acquire the initialization parameters for each block, resulting in better optimization results. Then, the retrieved output modules and initialization parameters are utilized during the training process of each block, the progressive model growing stage.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, block freezing determination is designed to evaluate the training progress of each block, safely freeze it after convergence and then trigger the training of the next block. Specifically, we propose a new metric from the scalar perspective to accurately assess the convergence status of each block. This metric captures the updated status of each scalar by analyzing its movement distance.
Initially, high gradients drive effective movement toward the optimal solution. As training advances, diminishing gradients lead to reduced scalar movement distance. Ultimately, scalar oscillation at the optimal solution results in near-zero movement distance within a window, signifying convergence. We sum movement distances of all scalars within a block, termed effective movement, as a measure of block training progress. This metric facilitates accurate tracking of individual block learning progress, allowing safe initiation of block freezing without compromising model performance. To the best of our knowledge, ProFL is the <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">first</span> work that breaks the memory wall of FL and resolve the restriction of client’s memory capacity on the global model to be trained.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In summary, our main contributions are as follows: (1) We propose ProFL, a novel FL approach that effectively breaks the memory wall through progressive block training. We decouple model training into progressive model shrinking and progressive model growing to assist each block in learning the expected feature representation. (2) To accurately evaluate the training progress of each block, we delve into the scalar perspective and introduce a novel metric named effective movement. (3) We theoretically prove the convergence of ProFL and conduct extensive experiments to validate its superiority on representative models and datasets.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to make the low-end devices participate in the learning process, the following two main categories of training methodologies have been proposed: 1) model-heterogeneous FL and 2) partial training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Model-Heterogeneous FL.</span> Model-heterogeneous FL is designed to relax the resource constraints of the mobile clients, in which different models are deployed on the central server and the participating clients. For instance, FedMD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(li2019fedmd, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>)</cite> customizes models with varying complexities for each client. After completing local training, the clients upload logits on a public dataset to the server. The server then aggregates the uploaded logits and conducts training on the public dataset, facilitating information transfer. Similar approaches include FedDF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(lin2020ensemble, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>)</cite>, DS-FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(itahara2021distillation, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>)</cite>, and Fed-ET <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(cho2022heterogeneous, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>)</cite>. However, these methods require a public dataset, which is typically not feasible in real-world cases due to privacy issues. Although some algorithms, such as FedZKT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(zhang2022fedzkt, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>)</cite>, generate a public dataset using GAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(goodfellow2020generative, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>)</cite>, the training of GAN is often unstable, which deteriorates the performance of the global model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Partial Training.</span> Partial training only trains part of the model by performing width scaling or depth scaling. HeteroFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(diao2020heterofl, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>)</cite> is a representative width scaling method, where convolutional layers are scaled to match devices with varying available memory capacity. Similar methods include Federated Dropout <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(caldas2018expanding, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>)</cite> and FjORD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(horvath2021fjord, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>)</cite>. However, these methods may significantly disrupt the model’s architecture, leading to performance degradation. Consequently, scaling the model from the depth perspective has been proposed. For instance, DepthFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(kim2022depthfl, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>)</cite> customizes models with different depths based on client memory constraints. However, the global model size in DepthFL is constrained by the device with the largest memory capacity. Motivated by this, we propose ProFL, a progressive training framework that gradually reduces memory requirements by intelligently freezing earlier layers. This framework facilitates training a larger global model than the largest client model.</p>

After that, the training process is triggered, ProFL initially performs progressive model shrinking by sequentially training each block of the model from back to front and integrating the information from each trained block into a convolutional layer.
The purpose of this stage is twofold: 1) obtaining the initialization parameters for each block and, 2) constructing the corresponding output modules for the progressive model growing using the obtained convolutional layers. Then, ProFL initiates progressive model growing by gradually expanding the model from the first block until each block has undergone sufficient training, ultimately achieving the target model. Throughout both the progressive model shrinking and progressive model growing stages, the training pace of each step is controlled by the block freezing determination to efficiently determine whether the current block has been well trained, safely freeze it and trigger the next training step.</p>

Inappropriately constructed output modules can significantly impact the final model performance. To address this challenge, we employ progressive model shrinking (Section <a href="#S3.SS2" title="3.2. Progressive Model Shrinking ‣ 3. ProFL ‣ Breaking the Memory Wall for Heterogeneous Federated Learning with Progressive Training" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.2</span></a>) before progressive model growing. This process facilitates obtaining convolutional layers with block-specific information for constructing output modules and acquiring the initialization parameters for each block.
The second challenge pertains to controlling the training pace of each block. As highlighted in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(wang2023egeria, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>)</cite>, improper freezing may adversely affect the final model performance. In response, we introduce a novel metric (Section <a href="#S3.SS3" title="3.3. Block Freezing Determination ‣ 3.

It is worth noting that, during the training process of each step, only the current block and the output module are updated. This significantly reduces the computational load of both forward and backward propagation, minimizing training overhead, and effectively reduces memory footprint. 2) Fig. <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 3.2.

However, the existing approaches cannot be directly applied to the FL scenario. For instance, Egeria <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(wang2023egeria, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>)</cite> uses a reference model for assessing layer convergence, relying on the raw training data, which are not accessible for privacy concerns in FL. To precisely evaluate the training progress of each block, we introduce a novel metric from the scalar perspective. This metric directs during both progressive model shrinking and progressive model growing stages.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.p1.3" class="ltx_p">In this section, we prove the convergence of the freezing-based progressive training paradigm based on <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(haddadpour2019convergence, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>)</cite>. While prior works have demonstrated the convergence of partial training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(mohtashami2021simultaneous, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>)</cite>, the key difference lies in their neglect of memory constraints.

</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For ResNet18, due to its relatively simple model architecture, there are some devices with sufficient memory to train the full model. Specifically, in CIFAR10 (IID), ProFL surpasses AllSmall with a 7.4% increase in accuracy.
This discrepancy arises from AllSmall’s global model, which is determined by the client with minimal memory, resulting in a simple global model that limits its feature extraction capabilities. Compared to ExclusiveFL, ProFL demonstrates an 18.8% accuracy improvement, attributed to ExclusiveFL’s exclusive engagement of high-memory clients, resulting in a mere 8% participation rate. In contrast, ProFL efficiently learns from low-memory clients’ data through its progressive training paradigm. Compared to HeteroFL, ProFL achieves an 8.6% performance enhancement. HeteroFL obtains local models of varying complexities by statically partitioning convolutional layer channels, restricting specific clients to train specific channels. This engenders uneven parameter training and significantly compromises the model’s architecture, impacting overall performance, with accuracy even underperforming compared to AllSmall.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Compared to DepthFL, an depth scaling approach, ProFL attains a 13.7% accuracy improvement. This is because DepthFL neglects the fact that memory footprint is predominantly caused by earlier blocks, leading to the exclusion of numerous devices unable to train the first block, resulting in a participation rate of only 47%. Furthermore, as earlier blocks utilize richer data, only a fraction of clients can train later blocks, causing uneven parameter training between blocks. Though knowledge distillation can facilitate information transfer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(hinton2015distilling, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>)</cite>, this mutual learning approach can even impede the learning of the earlier blocks when fewer high-memory clients exist. Under other ResNet18 experimental settings, ProFL enhances accuracy by 9.2% to 31.2% compared with the baselines.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">For ResNet34, its intricate model architecture demands more memory from each device to train the full model, leading to pronounced memory constraints. In this scenario, the performance of all algorithms experiences a decline compared to training ResNet18, and the training procedure cannot even be performed with ExclusiveFL as no client has enough memory to train the full model. However, ProFL still demonstrates outstanding performance. Particularly, in CIFAR10 (IID), ProFL attains a 15.3% accuracy improvement over AllSmall. Compared to HeteroFL, due to the absence of clients with sufficient memory to train the full model, certain channels cannot receive effective training, resulting in a significant performance drop of 72.4%. Similarly, DepthFL can only train the first classifier, and the other three classifiers cannot receive effective training. Therefore, when utilizing the ensemble results from four classifiers as the outcome, there is a significant accuracy decrease by 10.5%. In other ResNet34 experimental settings, ProFL improves accuracy by 18.3% to 74.2%.</p>

In conclusion, ProFL consistently attains superior performance across diverse settings, attributed to three key factors. Firstly, progressive training empowers ProFL to acquire a more complex global model than the largest client model. Secondly, the strategic freezing of earlier blocks mitigates memory requirements, allowing the involvement of more low-memory clients and achieving a 100% participation rate. Thirdly, synchronous training of the same parameters by participating clients at each step effectively resolves the challenge of parameter mismatch.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Effectiveness of Progressive Model Shrinking.</span> To analyze the impact of progressive model shrinking on different step-wise sub-models and the global models, we enable and disable progressive model shrinking and measure the accuracy of the respective models. We experiment with both IID and Non-IID data distributions on ResNet18 and ResNet34, and the results are shown in Table <a href="#S4.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 4.1. Settings ‣ 4. Experiments ‣ Breaking the Memory Wall for Heterogeneous Federated Learning with Progressive Training" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. Regardless of the data distribution and the global model architecture, it is evident that progressive model shrinking plays a crucial role in improving the accuracy of both step-wise sub-models and the global models. Specifically, it leads to performance improvements ranging from 0.5% to 6.7% for sub-models and 0.9% to 4.7% for global models.
This improvement can be attributed to two primary factors. Firstly, the parameters trained in the progressive model shrinking stage can be leveraged to initialize the corresponding blocks in the progressive model growing stage, resulting in better optimization results. Secondly, the convolutional layers obtained in the progressive model shrinking stage function as output module components, aiding the blocks in learning the expected feature representation.</p>

This is based on the observation that the blocks consisting of different amounts of parameters usually have various convergence rates. Table <a href="#S4.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ 4.3. Ablation Study ‣ 4.

signifying that the parameters are rapidly moving towards the optimal point.
Gradually, as gradients decrease and some parameters converge, it decreases until reaching a converged state. This signals that the current block’s parameters are near the optimal point, and further updates would offer marginal benefits, allowing for freezing and initiating the training of the next block. Notably, the convergence status of effective movement aligns consistently with accuracy curves in red, reinforcing effective movement as a robust indicator of block training progress.</p>

The X-axis represents the blocks being trained, the left Y-axis represents the memory usage, and the right Y-axis represents the corresponding participation rates. It can be observed that early blocks consume a significant amount of memory, primarily due to the large output dimensions of early activation layers, leading to a lower participation rate. As earlier blocks are gradually frozen, more low-memory clients participate, making this progressive paradigm inclusive.</p>

<p id="S4.SS6.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Communication Cost.</span> Although we divide the model training into two stages: progressive model shrinking and progressive model growing, the additional communication overhead is acceptable. This is for the reason that compared to communicating the parameters of the full model, we only communicate partial model parameters in each round. Taking ResNet as an example, Table <a href="#S4.T5" title="Table 5 ‣ 4.6. Discussion ‣ 4. Experiments ‣ Breaking the Memory Wall for Heterogeneous Federated Learning with Progressive Training" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> shows the number of parameters for each block in ResNet18 and ResNet34, as well as the percentage of parameters for each block. It can be observed that the parameter quantity of the earlier blocks is very small. For example, the first block of ResNet18 accounts for only 1.3% of the full model. At the same time, from Fig. <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 4.2. Performance Evaluation ‣ 4. Experiments ‣ Breaking the Memory Wall for Heterogeneous Federated Learning with Progressive Training" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> and Fig. <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 4.2. Performance Evaluation ‣ 4. Experiments ‣ Breaking the Memory Wall for Heterogeneous Federated Learning with Progressive Training" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, it can be seen that ProFL converges slowly when training the earlier blocks, but converges quickly when training the later blocks. This implies that ProFL is communication cost-friendly. For instance, compared to the ideal scenario of training the full model, when achieving 84% accuracy (CIFAR10, IID, ResNet18), ProFL incurs only a 59.4% increase in communication overhead while reducing peak memory usage by 53.3%. For situations with limited communication resources, we can eliminate the progressive model shrinking stage. In comparison to the ideal scenario, communication overhead can be reduced by 58.1%. However, this may lead to a certain degree of accuracy decline. Therefore, a trade-off between communication cost and accuracy should be carefully considered based on the specific scenario.</p>

However, ProFL can be directly applied to other models, such as Vision Transformer (ViT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(dosovitskiy2020image, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>)</cite> and NLP-related models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(vaswani2017attention, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>)</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(devlin2018bert, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>)</cite>. For example, Deep Incubation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(ni2023deep, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>)</cite> accelerates the convergence of ViT models by dividing them into different blocks for training. Therefore, we can construct output modules for these blocks using basic layers and train them using this progressive framework.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We present ProFL, a novel progressive training approach to tackle the memory heterogeneity challenge in FL. ProFL adopts a step-wise training strategy by dividing the model into blocks based on its original architecture.
We decouple the model training into two stages: progressive model shrinking and progressive model growing. During the progressive model shrinking stage, we meticulously construct corresponding output modules for each block to assist in learning the expected feature representation. Additionally, we obtain initialization parameters for each block, enhancing the optimization results. Moreover, we introduce a novel metric from the scalar perspective to control the training pace of each block. We theoretically prove the convergence of ProFL and conduct extensive experiments on representative models and datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of ProFL. The results demonstrate that ProFL effectively reduces peak memory footprint by up to 57.4% and improves model accuracy by up to 82.4%.</p>
