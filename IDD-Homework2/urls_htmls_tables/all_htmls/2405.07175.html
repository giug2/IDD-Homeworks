<p id="id29.id1" class="ltx_p">In Federated Learning (FL), the limited accessibility of data from diverse locations and user types poses a significant challenge due to restricted user participation. Expanding client access and diversifying data enhance models by incorporating diverse perspectives, thereby enhancing adaptability.
However, challenges arise in dynamic and mobile environments where certain devices may become inaccessible as FL clients, impacting data availability and client selection methods. To address this, we propose an On-Demand solution, deploying new clients using Docker Containers on-the-fly. Our On-Demand solution, employing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), targets client availability and selection, while considering data shifts, and container deployment complexities. It employs an autonomous end-to-end solution for handling model deployment and client selection. The DRL strategy uses a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework, with a Master Learner and a Joiner Learner.
The designed cost functions represent the complexity of the dynamic client deployment and selection.
Simulated tests show that our architecture can easily adjust to changes in the environment and respond to On-Demand requests. This underscores its ability to improve client availability, capability, accuracy, and learning efficiency, surpassing heuristic and tabular reinforcement learning solutions.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Various regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union, aim to protect data privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. However, the stringency of these regulations varies globally. A study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> revealed a notable increase in privacy requests from 2021 to 2022, indicating growing concerns about personal data protection. Access and Deletion requests saw a substantial peak, with a 72% year-over-year increase in data subject requests (DSRs) per 1 million identities as shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ On-Demand Model and Client Deployment in Federated Learning with Deep Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. A common approach to perform learning on such private data, and benefiting from shared knowledge is to use the Federated Learning (FL) mechanism <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. FL is a decentralized machine learning (ML) approach that trains models across local devices, and then aggregates them into a global model, ensuring privacy. Applications such as healthcare monitoring systems, traffic management, and edge computing benefit significantly from FL. For example, in remote patient monitoring, wearable devices generate health data continuously as patients move. Similarly, in traffic management and autonomous vehicles, FL can enhance traffic prediction models using real-time data from vehicles moving on the road. Likewise, edge computing applications rely on FL for collaborative model training across heterogeneous edge devices with high mobility.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">One of the main limitations in existing FL frameworks is in accessing the full potential of available data due to reliance on static clients, leading to incomplete or biased dataset representations and affecting model performance.
In today’s digital landscape, acquiring more clients is about efficiency. Advancements in mobile technology, exemplified by Apple’s move towards on-device ML execution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, signify a transformative leap for resource-constrained devices. This shift underscores devices’ capability to independently execute complex ML tasks, reducing reliance on external servers. Docker Containers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> allow swift service deployment on fog/edge devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, enabling high scalability. They also facilitate distributing ML models directly to clients, explored in our paper as On-Demand FL. Embracing containers for real-time deployment of learning algorithms unlocks new avenues for personalized services and adaptive decision-making.
Docker containers play a crucial role in enabling volunteering devices to participate actively as FL clients.
Deploying containers that encapsulate all the requisite components for clients, including libraries, methods, and APIs, empowers these devices to seamlessly transition into FL clients. By bundling necessary modules alongside their inherent resources and local data, these containers enable devices to effectively participate in FL processes, contributing to the learning process as clients without the need for extensive setup or configuration. By leveraging Docker containers, resource-constrained devices can dynamically acquire ML capabilities, actively participating in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. This maximizes their computing power utilization and taps into local data without compromising their limited resources. The combination of on-device ML execution, Docker containerization, and FL participation represents a reliable approach for preparing constrained devices for sophisticated ML tasks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Another major issue is the difficulty in responding effectively to changes in the underlying data distribution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> and adapting to data shifts <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> specifically in environments where clients have mobility, impacting model generalization. Researchers propose adaptive learning rate techniques and frameworks, incorporating advanced client selection strategies to optimize data distribution, client selection, and dynamic shifts within the data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Nevertheless, FL’s effectiveness relies on having a sufficient number of available clients and not only counting on static clients. Therefore, implementing an On-Demand client deployment technique ensures the availability of new clients for learning and introduces an innovative approach to selecting and managing data shifts. This autonomous, intelligent, and adaptive method transforms new client deployment, providing a dynamic solution that enhances adaptability and responsiveness to changing data distributions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">As our clients become more available and distributed, it’s important to implement a selection mechanism to guide the model learning effectively and address the challenges inherent in FL, as discussed earlier. Additionally, employing client selection enables us to optimize resource utilization by ensuring that only chosen clients participate in training. This strategy prevents unnecessary allocation of resources to unselected clients, thereby improving efficiency and maximizing the effectiveness of our On-Demand FL approach.
Dynamic device conditions require an adaptive approach for real-time deployment decisions. In today’s varied applications, intelligent components are crucial for adaptive responses. Heuristic solutions for client selection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, struggle to capture the changing nature of the FL environment. Relying on predefined rules, heuristics may not adapt well to rapid shifts in device availability.
The integration of Docker containers and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> techniques has gained attention <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. DRL outperforms traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL), particularly in scenarios involving tabular methods and linear approximations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. DRL’s utilization of deep neural networks enables it to effectively handle high-dimensional state and action spaces, overcoming the limitations of tabular methods and linear approximations. By approximating complex and nonlinear functions, DRL captures intricate patterns and dependencies within the environment, facilitating better generalization across similar states and actions. Additionally, DRL enhances sample efficiency through techniques like experience replay and target networks, while its flexibility in network architecture and learning algorithms allows for adaptation to diverse problem domains.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Integrating client selection through DRL into On-Demand FL boosts adaptability in real-world scenarios, enhancing model convergence and efficiency. DRL’s dynamic nature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> optimizes Docker container placement, transforming deployment decisions based on real-time feedback. This flexibility ensures FL models are placed effectively, opening possibilities for future applications.
Deep Q-learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, a key DRL component, excels at approximating complex functions, making it pivotal for tasks like resource management. Using deep Q-learning for client selection, model deployment, and demand analysis is promising. However, the exploration technique in RL may lead to initial errors, affecting convergence time.</p>

<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposes a novel architecture that offers on-demand container deployment of models and learning mechanisms on clustered clients with orchestrators to manage them. It explores combining Docker containers and DRL for FL model deployment optimization, discussing technical aspects, advantages, challenges, and potential applications. The integration shows promise in enhancing FL convergence and performance in the dynamic environment, defining it as an MDP architecture <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.
Our MDP framework enables proactive decision-making on placement, adapting to FL application requirements and device environments. Our approach considers factors such as the quantity of active hosts, priority, data volume, and data quality. Using deep Q-learning in our DRL agent proves effective in intelligent decision-making amid environmental changes. Due to the exploration time challenges faced by DRL and the undesirable prolonged convergence in FL with additional rounds, we suggest a solution that merges offline and online learning, using a Master Learner and Joiner Learner setup. This includes deploying a mature decision-making model. By blending both approaches, we utilize historical data for initial model development and refine it in real time for adaptability to changing trends in dynamic environments.
Our approach outperforms heuristic, tabular RL, and the VanillaFL random <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> solutions tested on the MDC dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, introduce a framework designed for Internet of Things (IoT) applications that harness Docker containerization to address challenges and the limitations of underpowered fog devices. They present an On-Demand fog architecture that enhances device availability by efficiently deploying containers and installing required services on fog devices. Building on this, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> extend the architecture further by proposing On-Demand micro-services and model deployment solutions that are cost-effective and maintain accessibility between end-users and available vehicular fog clusters, all facilitated by heuristic approaches.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, researchers delve into the complexities of training FL algorithms over real-world wireless networks. They tackle this challenge by formulating an optimization problem that considers both user selection and resource distribution to minimize the loss function. To address this, they derive a mathematical expression for the expected convergence rate of the FL algorithm, accounting for the influence of wireless factors. In another study, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> introduces a decentralized FL approach at the segment level, aiming to improve network capacity utilization across client nodes. In addition to that, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> adopts a combination of integer programming techniques to tackle resource allocation and deployment challenges in Mobile Edge Computing (MEC). In addition to that, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, the authors explore the concept of expanding fog resources in terms of quantity and capability through the application of RL methods.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> presented a framework for FL, targeting non-IID data and limited network connectivity on mobile devices. By employing deep Q-learning for intelligent client selection, this approach minimized communication rounds while maximizing validation accuracy. Similarly, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> focused on FL for heterogeneous and private IIoT data, leveraging DRL to select precise IIoT equipment nodes and enhance model aggregation rates, thereby reducing communication costs. Additionally, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> utilized double deep Q-learning for client selection, considering trust and resource factors. Despite the efficacy of DRL in solving selection problems in FL, introducing new clients via containers amplifies the complexity of selection due to device dynamics, heterogeneity, and usage patterns. For that, a DRL solution to the On-Demand architecture necessitates the consideration of multiple additional objectives during client selection and deployment when compared to the previously mentioned DRL solutions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, the authors developed a solution to address issues related to client availability, wherein models often exhibit bias towards clients with higher availability. However, this work did not propose a solution to maintain overall availability across multiple clients in diverse locations. Various strategies have been proposed in the literature to tackle data shifts in FL. Adaptive learning rate techniques and model personalization strategies have been explored to mitigate changes in data distributions among clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Additionally, methods such as domain adaptation and continual learning have been investigated to enable models to adapt effectively to shifting data over time <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. While these solutions contribute to the resilience of FL models against data shifts, their primary focus has been on addressing distribution issues within available client data at specific stages. However, these approaches have not emphasized the concept of deploying clients strategically to ensure models learn from more diverse datasets. By deploying such clients, a larger set of clients becomes available for selection, along with access to more data.</p>

<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">However, it’s important to note that when there is a shortage of available clients for participation in FL, none of the client selection and optimization methods described earlier are applicable. Moreover, Adaptive learning rate techniques and model personalization strategies, though valuable, may struggle when confronted with scenarios where clients have intermittent or limited availability, potentially leading to incomplete model updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. In addition, domain adaptation and continual learning methods to handle data shifts may not fully account for situations where new clients join or existing clients become unavailable during the learning process.
This paper places its focus on the challenge of ensuring available clients and the successful execution of FL applications in diverse scenarios where no prior research has explored the feasibility of employing a DRL solution for On-Demand FL. Given the advantages inherent in On-Demand FL deployment, which entails efficiently preparing and introducing clients to FL while optimizing their deployment and selection.
The issues mentioned above have captivated researchers’ focus, prompting them to explore the utilization of DRL as a better alternative to heuristic methods. DRL is particularly advantageous as it considers the shifts in data availability and accommodates changes, offering a more effective approach to address these challenges. This motivation led to the proposal of a DRL solution for the On-Demand FL model and client deployment architecture.
To the best of our knowledge, there has been no previous work that has provided the capability to instantaneously deploy FL clients using DRL whenever and wherever volunteer devices are accessible but don’t have the required software to train and download the model, which in turn enables the environment to engage in model training and leverage the resulting data effectively.</p>

FL revolutionizes the traditional model by enabling the collaborative training of a global model distributed across various clients, leveraging their localized data. Through iterative aggregation of updated parameters from individual client training sessions, the server orchestrates the refinement of the global model, thereby enhancing convergence and accuracy over successive rounds <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. However, client failures or delayed parameter reports pose a significant challenge, potentially leading to excluding learning rounds and disrupting the learning process. Thus, while selecting clients, ensuring their consistent availability and substantial resource allocation for active participation is essential. Additionally, creating a learning environment involves establishing a connection, gathering resources, installing components, and starting the training protocol.</p>

<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The proposed architecture, as shown in Figure <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ II Literature Review ‣ On-Demand Model and Client Deployment in Federated Learning with Deep Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, consists of three distinct entities: the server, orchestrator, and volunteering device, each entrusted with specific responsibilities. The server assumes the centralized management of client provisioning, the global model, and secure connections, while orchestrators administer Kubeadm clusters <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, supervise container deployment, monitor device dynamics, and integrate new clients while handling the deployment and selection process in their area of reach. The reason for selecting a Kubeadm cluster is its ability to swiftly generate and set up clusters without the necessity of manually dealing with the cluster configuration. This tool simplifies the procedure by automating tasks like initializing the control plane, integrating nodes into the cluster, and setting up network plugins. In instances of significant device mobility, orchestrators seamlessly manage client requests, forwarding them to the server for container deployment, thus fortifying the system against single-point failures and mitigating server overload. Each orchestrator operates within a defined area, managing a finite set of clients within its reach and availability. These clients are the ones accessible within their designated geographical area, ensuring that the orchestrator efficiently handles a manageable number of connections. Through the utilization of lightweight containers and the inherent flexibility of the architecture, clients can execute ML models from any location, thereby ensuring optimal resource efficiency. Operating exclusively on devices engaged in FL rounds, clients can run ML models from any location, we maximize resource utilization and enhance the efficacy of the learning process.</p>

This enables the system to make informed decisions quickly, without the need for extensive trial-and-error experimentation. Subsequently, the DRL Joiner Learner component plays a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency of the learning process. Rather than starting from scratch with each new model iteration, the DRL Joiner Learner receives a mature model, from this component, that has already undergone significant refinement and optimization. This approach circumvents the need for long learning periods typically associated with training new models from scratch. Instead, the mature model serves as a solid foundation, facilitating rapid integration into the system and contributing to the creation of an On-Demand learning environment.</p>

The server considers weekday/weekend status for orchestrator placement. Assuming a list of potential mini-server orchestrators, the server identifies Kubernetes cluster locations and enrolls volunteer devices during orchestrator node configuration. All eligible devices in the area join the Kubeadm cluster <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. With the environment prepared, services can be deployed promptly. It’s crucial for the Master node to remain active, as the cluster fails if it goes down.

We’re not intentionally making the data less evenly distributed (non-IID), but deploying more clients increases data volume. Non-IID data in FL refers to diverse data distributions across clients, challenging the aggregation for a global model while maintaining privacy and data locality. This objective allows more diverse class labels available within each area for learning, and shared output class labels available across different area locations for a broader understanding.</p>

Orchestrators monitor user movements and locations, and when there’s significant activity in an area, a message is transmitted to the server, asking for the deployment of containers on clients situated in those areas. Furthermore, the data advisor component plays a crucial role in achieving this objective by providing feedback to the orchestrator regarding the drift in data availability in specific geographical areas. This proactive engagement enhances the overall quality of the learning process, concurrently minimizing the need for discarding rounds.</p>

To enhance global model accuracy and consider round number, the agent incorporates these factors into the state. This enables monitoring of the global model’s performance, facilitating the identification of clients causing performance drifts to avoid their future selection.
As shown in Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="In IV-C Solution ‣ IV Formulation and Solution ‣ On-Demand Model and Client Deployment in Federated Learning with Deep Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, Deep Q Learning extends Q-learning by integrating a Neural Network, surpassing traditional methods. Instead of relying on a Q-table, this approach utilizes a Neural Network to process a state, estimating Q-values for each action. This shift addresses the limitations of Q-tables in scenarios with numerous actions and complex game states, where traditional methods prove impractical, inefficient, and slow. The integration of a Deep Neural Network allows for a more scalable solution. The network receives the state as input and generates distinct Q-values for each available action. The ultimate decision involves selecting the action associated with the best Q-value. While the fundamental learning process remains unchanged, employing an iterative update approach, the key divergence lies in the mechanism of improvement. Instead of updating a Q-table, the weights in the neural network are adjusted, enhancing the quality of the outputs and ensuring adaptability. Deep Q-Network (DQN) uses experience replay, where past experiences are stored in a replay buffer and randomly sampled during training. This helps break correlations between consecutive samples and leads to more stable learning. Moreover, it employs two separate neural networks. The target network’s parameters are periodically updated with the main network’s parameters, providing more stable targets for the Q-values.

The idea behind top-p is that rather than examining every possible action, the agent arranges actions according to their probabilities, such as the softmax probabilities derived from Q-values. It then picks a subset of actions that together represent a specific proportion, <math id="S4.SS3.p3.6.m6.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="p" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p3.6.m6.1a"><mi id="S4.SS3.p3.6.m6.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p3.6.m6.1.1.cmml">p</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p3.6.m6.1b"><ci id="S4.SS3.p3.6.m6.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p3.6.m6.1.1">𝑝</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p3.6.m6.1c">p</annotation></semantics></math>, of the probability distribution. This method ensures that the agent explores a variety of actions while giving priority to those with higher probabilities of being the best choice. This way, the agent can balance between exploiting well-known, high-value actions and exploring potentially beneficial but less common actions.</p>

This dataset provides a comprehensive collection of continuous client movement records, enabling us to extract features that are important in predicting clients’ subsequent locations. The inclusion of place details, time indicators, and destination labels in the dataset allows our model to showcase the real-world significance of On-Demand FL. By working with this dataset, we aim to demonstrate the applicability of On-Demand FL in scenarios where client movements in geographical locations play a pivotal role, emphasizing its importance in real settings.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we compare our approach with heuristic implementations based on genetic algorithm, tabular RL, and the default random method of selecting clients. Our contribution is the first to address On-Demand FL through DRL, and our thorough comparative analyses distinguish our work. We are not comparing with other literature works that adapt DRL for client selection in FL since our On-Demand context requires different objectives.
In the following sections, we’ll demonstrate how our solution facilitated the DRL agent’s learning progress over time, along with showcasing cost variations. Additionally, we’ll present statistics indicating an increase in the number of participating clients in FL rounds compared to previous static deployments and how that helps in managing data shifts and availability in the learning area locations. Moreover, we’ll compare the overall accuracy levels achieved by various implemented solutions across different scenarios. Finally, we’ll assess how our solution effectively maintains high accuracy levels while minimizing the number of discarded rounds during the learning phase.</p>

The graph is presented using a logarithmic scale to enhance the clarity of visualization for the agent’s performance. It is evident that our solution successfully converged and reduced the cost function while adhering to the predefined objective functions and constraints. The convergence and scalability are compatible with the number and diversity of clients we have. This convergence process contributes to the development of the intelligent Master Learner component. Subsequently, this pre-trained DRL model through our offline mechanism is used by orchestrators for the On-Demand deployment of clients and models, all without any delays. At this stage, the orchestrator seamlessly utilizes this mature model to initiate the FL application.</p>

<div id="S5.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">2) Our innovative approach to On-Demand client deployment has proven to be a game-changer in the world of FL, significantly enhancing client engagement and data availability. By seamlessly integrating our methodology, we have observed a notable number of clients actively participating in the learning process. This act, as reflected in Figure <a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ V Results and Analysis ‣ On-Demand Model and Client Deployment in Federated Learning with Deep Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, underscores the efficacy of our strategy in not only attracting a higher number of clients but also fostering sustained engagement throughout the learning period. The noticeable increase in data availability is readily apparent when introducing new clients, characterized by deeper and more vibrant colors, in sharp contrast to the relatively static presentation observed when relying on fixed clients. The consequential increase in the volume of available data is invaluable for FL, as it directly translates to a richer and more diverse dataset for model training. The positive correlation between our On-Demand deployment and enhanced client participation highlights the important role our approach plays in optimizing the FL ecosystem, ultimately contributing to more robust and accurate ML models. At this point, the orchestrators have a greater quantity of clients available for selection, and the process of selection will be further examined in the upcoming sections.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, in instances where the FL environment encounters data shifts due to changes in client locations, resulting in decreased data quantity and diversity in certain areas, our solution assumes a critical role in effectively addressing these shifts. Specifically, leveraging the fourth objective function, our approach empowers orchestrators to strategically determine the deployment of containers and the establishment of new clients in regions experiencing data scarcity and a shortage of available clients due to these dynamic data shifts.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">3) In environments where static and mobile devices coexist, a treasure amount of data awaits the process of learning. However, many of these devices are frequently engaged or may lack the requisite capabilities to engage in FL. The strategic deployment of Docker containers through containerization technology becomes the catalyst for augmenting the available device pool, offering significant advantages to FL applications while elevating their accuracy as shown in Figure <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ V-B Experiments ‣ V Results and Analysis ‣ On-Demand Model and Client Deployment in Federated Learning with Deep Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>.
What sets our approach apart is the broad and diversified spectrum of potential clients it provides. By using our DRL solution, we swiftly attained our target accuracy in less than 10 rounds, marking a substantial advancement over the proficient but comparatively slower tabular RL approach. When confronted with a large number of devices, the tabular complexity of tabular RL significantly impacts memory and resources. In our exploration, we also evaluated a Genetic Algorithm. This algorithm often faces challenges in swiftly adapting to the rapid transformations inherent in dynamic environments. Notably, in the context of this implementation, heuristics tended to extend the convergence process, requiring more rounds to reach stability, particularly in new and rapidly changing area locations and environments. In contrast, our solution demonstrated exceptional performance by adeptly navigating and adapting to the dynamic nature of the environment. This stands in contrast to genetic algorithms, which may encounter challenges converging as efficiently due to the risk of falling into local optima, necessitating more rounds for the model to reach convergence.
In contrast, the VanillaFL framework adheres to a fixed fraction of clients. The distinguishing feature of our architecture lies in its capacity to dynamically select the client set for each round, and efficiently adapt to changing conditions while using DRL agents. The expeditious convergence of the DRL algorithm underscores its effectiveness in addressing the challenges posed by swift and unpredictable changes in the environment, solidifying its position as a more adaptive and responsive solution. Reducing the number of rounds required for convergence holds several significant advantages. Firstly, it minimizes the communication overhead between the central server and individual clients, thereby reducing bandwidth consumption and latency. Furthermore, it also mitigates the risk of privacy breaches and reduces the computational burden on clients. Finally, it helps result in a faster model update and adaptation to changing data distributions or client populations.

This approach aimed to prioritize clients with high movement volumes and discard the objective that looks for clients with local accuracies similar to the global accuracy. The intention was to deploy these high-movement clients early in the process, potentially leading to higher global accuracy. However, Figure <a href="#S5.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ V-B Experiments ‣ V Results and Analysis ‣ On-Demand Model and Client Deployment in Federated Learning with Deep Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>.a indicates that this strategy prolonged the convergence time to around 18 rounds, with early-round accuracy noticeably lower compared to Run 1 and the Main run.
This discrepancy underscores the significance of including clients with comparable local accuracies to the global accuracy in the early rounds of learning. Such inclusion can significantly elevate the global accuracy in the initial stages of deployment.

Consequently, more resources are expended without a corresponding increase in accuracy. This underscores the critical importance of selecting an optimal combination of quantity and quality of clients to achieve the desired accuracy with fewer learning rounds and minimized resource utilization. This is particularly important in On-Demand applications, where client devices may be repurposed for alternative deployments beyond the current task.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p8.1" class="ltx_p">5) Furthermore, data availability and shifts significantly impact the total number of rounds required for model convergence. Client movements, influencing the data distribution the model learns from, directly affect access to available or new data, consequently impacting the overall convergence speed. This relationship is illustrated in Fig <a href="#S5.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ V-B Experiments ‣ V Results and Analysis ‣ On-Demand Model and Client Deployment in Federated Learning with Deep Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>, where our DRL approach successfully utilized at least 92% of the training rounds. In contrast, the heuristic approach may get stuck in local optima, and the random factors in selecting parent chromosomes introduce unpredictability in predicting data shifts, necessitating more rounds for convergence. The default approach, lacking effective selection, resulted in discarding over 60% of rounds.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper focuses on dynamically deploying FL clients in specific regions through DRL and collaboration with volunteering devices, utilizing Kubeadm and Docker for swift response to real-time demands.
Our approach takes into account the mobility of clients and performs optimally in environments with a high volume of available devices to be used. Our experiments illustrate the effectiveness of deploying On-Demand FL clients, substantially reducing the time required to achieve the desired accuracy compared to conventional methods. Simulations in real-world scenarios validate the feasibility of our approach, underscoring the advantages of incorporating more clients into the learning process. Our findings indicate improvements in accuracy during the initial stages, fewer discarded rounds, and increased availability of volunteering clients for other applications, resulting in reduced resource usage. Our approach underscores the importance of adapting to data shifts in FL settings by having new client deployments in areas where clients change locations. Moving forward, we aim to explore the integration of multiple models into our framework and incorporate reward-shaping techniques to further enhance the solution.</p>
