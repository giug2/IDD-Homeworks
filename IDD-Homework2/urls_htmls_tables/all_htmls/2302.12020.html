<p id="id6.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is recently surging as a promising decentralized deep learning (DL) framework that enables DL-based approaches trained collaboratively across clients without sharing private data. However, in the context of the central party being active and dishonest, the data of individual clients might be perfectly reconstructed, leading to the high possibility of sensitive information being leaked. Moreover, FL also suffers from the nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID) data among clients, resulting in the degradation in the inference performance on local clients’ data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely Personalized Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (PPPFL), with a concentration on cross-silo FL to overcome these challenges. Specifically, we introduce a stabilized variant of the Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) algorithm to collaboratively train a global initialization from clients’ synthetic data generated by Differential Private Generative Adversarial Networks (DP-GANs). After reaching convergence, the global initialization will be locally adapted by the clients to their private data. Through extensive experiments, we empirically show that our proposed framework outperforms multiple FL baselines on different datasets, including MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Although deep learning (DL) approaches have achieved significant accomplishments in a wide range of applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, there exists several fundamental challenges <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> that yet need to be addressed in order to enable its complete power. Due to data sovereignty and data privacy concerns, one major problem is the difficulty in the centralization of the local data from multiple clients to one central server.
In order to guarantee the privacy-preserving in training schemes, federated learning (FL) framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> is proposed to allow multiple entities (e.g., individuals, or organizations) collaboratively train a DL model under the coordination of a central server. Specifically, each client’s data is trained and stored locally, and only updated gradients are transferred to the server for aggregation purposes. By keeping the training data locally and in a decentralized fashion, FL approaches can alleviate many of the systemic privacy risks of traditional centralized DL methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, under FL’s naive implementation, there are several key challenges <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, including private information leakage, verifiable computation, expensive communication costs, and statistical heterogeneity.
In the scope of this research, we focus on the problem of private information being divulged in FL settings. Generally, despite the local training without data exchange between the server and clients, private information can still be leaked to some extent from the local gradients through inversion attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. More seriously, as the central server holds full control of observing and modifying the shared global model, sensitive information can also be eavesdropped on by the server. For instance, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citeauthor"><a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">Boenisch et al.</a></cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> identified that an active-and-dishonest server can set up trap weights for recovering the clients’ data with zero reconstruction loss.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">With the aim of limiting information disclosure about private data, a state-of-the-art privacy-preserving technique was proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citeauthor"><a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">Dwork et al.</a></cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, known as differential privacy (DP). The central principle of this technique is to add curated noises to the computational steps to perturb the sensitive information.
In general, there are two approaches to incorporating DP into FL settings: global DP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> and local DP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Under global DP, clients are assumed to trust the centralized server, and noises are added by the server; while under local DP, each client perturbs its information locally prior to sharing it with the server without requiring trust in a server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Despite the addition of noises, global DP approaches cannot ensure privacy preservation in the case of the server being dishonest. Therefore, in this research, we concentrate on the local DP scenario to enhance the privacy protection of the clients against gradient leakage and parameter modification.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Another issue in FL is the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, caused by the heterogeneity in local data distributions among clients. In particular, in non-IID scenarios, different clients train models from different data distributions, which leads to the performance degradation of the aggregated model. This problem was especially taken into consideration in the cases of cross-silo FL where clients are large entities (e.g., companies, institutions, and hospitals), and their private data may be greatly different in size and partitioning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. There are plenty of approaches introduced for handling non-IID problems, such as sharing data with the server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, fine-tuning the local models after obtaining the aggregated model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, adding personalized layers in local models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, and transferring knowledge from the server to a certain client <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. While those methods mitigate the non-IID data distribution in FL in some cases, they inevitably increase the risk of privacy leakage and a large number of hyperparameters <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, to mitigate the above challenging FL problems, we propose a Personalized Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (PPPFL) framework for cross-silo FL, a novel framework that allows local clients simultaneously protect their own initial data at the instance-level and achieve a personalized model. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to marry two lines of research in FL on privacy-preserving and non-IID data, to achieve both differential privacy guarantees and better convergence performance. This framework consists of two computational stages: server-side computations and client-side computations. In terms of the former stage, building on meta-learning methods, the primary goal is to find an initial global model shared between all clients which performs well after each client updates it with respect to its own generated artificial data (Section <a href="#S4.SS2.SSS3" title="4.2.3 Server-side computations ‣ 4.2 Our Proposed Framework ‣ 4 Methodology ‣ Personalized Privacy-Preserving Framework for Cross-Silo Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.2.3</span></a>). In this way, the final model implemented by each local client can achieve stronger generalization guarantees and more personalized adaptation. Regarding the latter stage, each local client generates synthetic data by training a differentially private data generative model (Section <a href="#S4.SS2.SSS4" title="4.2.4 DP-GAN training ‣ 4.2 Our Proposed Framework ‣ 4 Methodology ‣ Personalized Privacy-Preserving Framework for Cross-Silo Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.2.4</span></a>).
Those data are then utilized for collaboration purposes in the Federated training phase, therefore preventing sharing of the raw data (Section <a href="#S4.SS2.SSS2" title="4.2.2 Client-side computations ‣ 4.2 Our Proposed Framework ‣ 4 Methodology ‣ Personalized Privacy-Preserving Framework for Cross-Silo Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.2.2</span></a>). Moreover, we also focus on cross-silo FL as attention put on applying FL to multiple large organizations has greatly grown <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. Therefore, it is sufficient for our proposed GANs-based framework to guarantee the DP in cross-silo FL.

Because of the Active-and-dishonest threat server, in this work, we mainly focus on local DP in which noise addition is conducted by each local client to prevent perfect extractability of individually private information. Many DP approaches based on the SGD algorithm have been proposed to protect the privacy of clients. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citeauthor"><a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">Sun et al.</a></cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> used the adaptive range of clients’ weights to achieve better-aggregated model performance, especially in deeper models, and leveraged parameter shuffling as an extra layer of privacy protection. Meanwhile, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> allowed the individual clients to define their own local privacy setting by developing a local training approach and a parameter update sharing method, based on Condensed Local Differential Privacy with Exponential Mechanism <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. In order to minimize the tradeoff between the privacy budget and the convergence performance, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citeauthor"><a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">Wei et al.</a></cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> proposed a DP-SGD-based communication rounds discounting method.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Another approach to mitigating the privacy concern for data sharing is to utilize generative models. The key idea of this approach is consolidating generative models to locally synthesize data, and then these generated data would be sent to the server by clients for collaboration. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citeauthor"><a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">Chen et al.</a></cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> first leveraged the power of autoencoder in FL that allows clients to generate their own artificial data by independently feeding their private data into the autoencoder. Under the FL framework and DP thinking, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> introduced FedDPGAN for COVID-19 pneumonia detection without compromising patients’ sensitive information. In this method, each medical institution adds Gaussian noise in training gradients, and then parameters are sent to the server for training COVID-19 diagnostic models collaboratively.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, those approaches have not taken non-IID data into consideration which inevitably causes a deterioration in the accuracy of FL. In this research, we not only handle privacy concerns but also focus on non-IID problems. Moreover, in real-world industrial environments which is referred to as the cross-silo setting, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> utilized RAPPOR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> and optimized unary encoding that can efficiently control the privacy budgets and address the massive data distribution in many industrial applications (e.g., healthcare, smart cities). Inspired by this work, we also provide a framework for privacy-preserving FL to be utilized under cross-silo settings, potentially with untrusted parties.
<br class="ltx_break">
<br class="ltx_break"><span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Solving the non-IID problem in FL.</span> Due to the heterogeneity in participants’ data distributions, possessing a global model that can fit all the models among the parties is difficult <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. To handle this issue, personalization approaches have received much attention recently. The early work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> cast the personalization problem as a multi-task learning problem, which generates separated but associated models for each client. Meanwhile, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> allowed each client to have personalized layers followed by base layers, and only the base layers are shared with the parameter server. This approach is able not only to boost the learning performance of FL on unknown heterogeneous data but also to reduce the communication costs since clients are not necessarily to share the whole model with the server. Knowledge distillation is also a promising approach for personalized FL with the main idea of transferring knowledge from the server or other clients to a particular client to enhance its performance on non-IID data. Transfer learning is utilized by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, in which <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citeauthor"><a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">Liu et al.</a></cite> incorporated additively homomorphic encryption (HE) and secret sharing while <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citeauthor"><a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">Lin et al.</a></cite> leveraged an ensemble distillation strategy respectively, to allow knowledge to be shared without compromising user privacy. Another important chart of knowledge distillation is federated domain adaptation which aims at eliminating the differences between data shards between clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>. The most effective and powerful personalization method is to incorporate meta-learning within FL. MAML <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> has been leveraged in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>, where authors proposed Personalized FedAvg to seek a proper initialization model for the clients that can be easily updated with the local data of each client after the training phase.</p>

Due to the existence of the data leakage through gradients of the FC layer, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citeauthor"><a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">Boenisch et al.</a></cite> has raised high privacy-related concerns in FL settings as the central party holds full control of observing and modifying the shared gradients. Although the addition of the calibrated noise into the users’ data or shared parameters can prevent the data reconstruction attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>, <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>, <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>, these implementations provide virtually no protection against a non-honest server since the additional step is performed by the server but not the clients themselves. Therefore, it is evident that for the active-but-dishonest server, no privacy guarantees can be provided to the clients.
In this paper, our goal is to design a differentially private framework, which ensures that the synthetic data instead of the sent parameters are differentially private. By this setting, clients only send the model’s parameters trained with DPGAN-by generated data to the server for collaboration; thus differential privacy can be guaranteed even in cases of a non-honest central party.</p>

In FL, global differential privacy (global DP) refers to a privacy-preserving technique in which a trusted aggregator adds noise to multiple users’ data or parameter updates to protect their privacy. The noise is added using a DP mechanism, which is designed to ensure that the noise is sufficient to prevent the identification of any individual user’s data, even when the aggregator has access to the data of all users.
However, when the central server, or aggregator, is active and dishonest, it could identify the data of individual users. Hence, local DP adds noise to the data locally before it is sent to the central server or transmitted over an insecure network.</p>

User-level DP is a variant of local DP used when the data consists of a smaller number of samples associated with specific users, and the focus is on protecting the privacy of the users rather than the privacy of the individual data points.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, instance-level differential privacy is generally more robust than user-level DP because it provides stronger privacy guarantees for individual data samples. Particularly, instance-level DP ensures that the probability of an adversary learning sensitive information about a specific data point is bounded by a small privacy budget. Moreover, instance-level DP is easier to implement and apply in practice than user-level DP, as it does not require tracking or identifying specific users or user groups in the dataset, thus making it more flexible and easier to use, especially in the context of cross-silo FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">GANs are successfully utilized in plenty of applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite>, such as image in-painting, image super-resolution, image-to-image translation, language, and speech synthesis.
Due to the high expressiveness of deep neural networks in modeling the data distribution, DL-based generative models can output high-fidelity samples. However, similar to other DL-based architectures, GAN models are also vulnerable to several privacy violation attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> that might extract massive sensitive information from generated data. In order to provide rigorous privacy guarantees to synthetic data, many approaches adopted DP in GANs in hopes of enabling high learning efficacy without disclosing much sensitive information about individuals within the training set. DP-GAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite> and DP-CGAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>]</cite> are two earlier approaches introduced to adapt DP-SGD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite> to GAN. The principle of this method is to add calibrated Gaussian noise to the discriminator gradients during the training step. Later, in order to address a major limitation of prior studies related to privacy budget explosion, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citeauthor"><a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">Papernot et al.</a></cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite> integrated the off-the-shelf Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE) framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite> into GAN to provide better privacy budget usage while mitigating the sensitive data disclosure. Specifically, PATE-GAN first learns a set of teacher discriminators on a disjoint subset of training data and then aggregates the output of these teacher models to train a student discriminator. Another variant, G-PATE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>]</cite> improved PATE-GAN by directly training scalable differentially private student generators to preserve high generated data utility. Nevertheless, those still cannot generate differentially private high dimensional data with strong privacy guarantees.

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we present a formal problem formulation in which the goal is to enhance privacy in personalized Federated Learning. We then proceed to describe our proposed solution to this problem, the PPPFL framework, in detail. This includes a step-by-step description of the process, beginning with the training of local models on the client side and culminating in the federated collaboration between the clients and the server. Finally, we provide theoretical proof demonstrating the privacy and convergence guarantees of the PPPFL framework.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We now briefly illustrate the proposed PPPFL framework, which includes 3 main phases: local data generation, federated training, and local adaptation (as depicted in Fig. <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 3.4 Optimization-based Meta-learning ‣ 3 Preliminaries ‣ Personalized Privacy-Preserving Framework for Cross-Silo Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>). In our method, the DP gradient compression and aggregation approach and the optimization-based meta-learning algorithm serve as key components which help the PPPFL prevent individual information disclosures and improve the consistency among local models.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this framework, besides the gradient sharing process with the server, the clients need to compute two extra steps, which are described in Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ 4.2 Our Proposed Framework ‣ 4 Methodology ‣ Personalized Privacy-Preserving Framework for Cross-Silo Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. First, to ensure the instance-level DP for the framework, each client needs to train a differentially private data generator to synthesize their own dataset which is then used for collaboration. Under this setting, our framework can provide stronger privacy guarantees for individual data samples, mitigating information disclosure problems. The second additional step is that clients are expected to perform a local adaptation step on their kept private data after receiving the well-initialized parameters from the central party. This step contributes to the generation of a generalized and personalized model for each client. We assume two added steps are trivial as the clients are large organizations with high computational power.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS5.p1.10" class="ltx_p">As previously noted by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citeauthor"><a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">Antoniou et al.</a></cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>]</cite>, the optimization process in Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) can be unstable due to the multiple times that differentiation is performed through the model. This instability is illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S4.F2.sf1" title="In Figure 2 ‣ 4.2.3 Server-side computations ‣ 4.2 Our Proposed Framework ‣ 4 Methodology ‣ Personalized Privacy-Preserving Framework for Cross-Silo Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2(a)</span></a>, which shows that the original MAML model diverges after just a few communication rounds. To address this issue, we propose a modified version of MAML that employs Model Exponential Moving Average in the inner loop, followed by Cosine Annealing Learning rate scheduling in the outer loop. This approach is inspired by previous work on improving generalization in DL over Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) in general <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">63</a>, <a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>, <a href="#bib.bib65" title="" class="ltx_ref">65</a>]</cite> and improving stability in MAML in specific <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>]</cite>.

Specifically, we outperform the baselines by a significant margin in multiple datasets, we also push the frontier of data privacy and data utility by achieving good performance while maintaining DP guarantees. In terms of accuracy, our proposed method outperforms previous works in all four benchmarks, MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, with the corresponding figures: 0.9640, 0.9199, 0.80, and 0.480. Regarding BMT-F1, in the CIFAR-10 dataset, our framework is also superior to the FedMeta algorithms by more than 2.5%, while this figure achieves by nearly 8.0% regarding the CIFAR-100 dataset.</p>

The purpose of this experiment is to approximate the lower bounds and upper bounds of the models’ performance when using different training and testing data setups. Regarding the first group, the independent local training scenario without FL is conducted to form a strong baseline. For the second group, FL collaboration procedures with and without using private data as the clients’ training sets are performed to demonstrate the necessity of local adaptation.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we show that our proposed Personalized Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (PPPFL) framework could not only minimize the risk of sensitive information being leaked but also overcome the challenges of the nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID) data among clients. We demonstrate the efficiency of the PPPFL framework as it outperforms many existing baselines on both DP-synthetic and non-private synthetic data when evaluating different datasets, including MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100. We also indicate the existence of a trade-off between synthetic data privacy levels and the model’s performance. Despite our framework’s performance improvements, conducting experiments with other GANs architectures is necessary.</p>

<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">User incentive to participate in the protocol.</span> In this part of our work, we focus on the incentives for users to participate in the PPPFL framework. In cross-silo FL, organizations or companies usually have intentionally long-term strategic focuses and development goals. This makes the long-term cooperation relationship more possible, as long as we can design a proper incentive mechanism. To this end, we demonstrate a strong correlation between the local performance of a user’s model and the benefits that each client derives from participating in the protocol. This correlation is shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F4.sf2" title="In Figure 4 ‣ 5.1 Experiment Setup ‣ 5 Evaluation ‣ Personalized Privacy-Preserving Framework for Cross-Silo Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4(b)</span></a>. Particularly, if local models have lower performance, it is evident that they would gain more from participating in the PPPFL protocol.</p>
