<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-promoting framework that enables potentially large number of clients to collaboratively train machine learning models. In an FL system, a server coordinates the collaboration by collecting and aggregating clients’ model updates while the clients’ data remains local and private. A major challenge in federated learning arises when the local data is non-iid – the setting in which performance of the learned global model may deteriorate significantly compared to the scenario where the data is identically distributed across the clients. In this paper we propose FedDPMS (<span id="id2.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">Fed</span>erated <span id="id2.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">D</span>ifferentially <span id="id2.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">P</span>rivate <span id="id2.id1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">M</span>eans <span id="id2.id1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">S</span>haring), an FL algorithm in which clients augment local datasets with data synthesized using differentially private information collected and communicated by a trusted server. In particular, the server matches the pairs of clients having complementary local datasets and facilitates differentially-private sharing of the means of latent data representations; the clients then deploy variational auto-encoders to enrich their datasets and thus ameliorate the effects of non-iid data distribution. Our experiments on deep image classification tasks demonstrate that FedDPMS outperforms competing state-of-the-art FL methods specifically developed to address the challenge of federated learning on non-iid data.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The need for massive amounts of high-quality training data in deep learning (e.g., ImageNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, COCO <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>) creates a major challenge in settings where data is distributed across a potentially large number of users’ devices; in particular, constraints on communication resources and users’ privacy concerns often prohibit gathering local data and training models at a central location. In response, <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">federated learning</span> (FL) where users collaboratively train a global model without revealing personal data has emerged as a privacy-promoting and communication-efficient distributed alternative to centralized learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In FL systems, a subset of users’ devices updates a global model by training on local data; a server coordinates the training process by selecting the users, collecting the updates, and aggregating them to form a new global model. The original FL algorithm, <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Federated Averaging</span> (FedAvg) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, chooses users at random and updates the global model by averaging the users’ updates;
the convergence analysis provided in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> assumes that local datasets are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). Recently, improving performance of FL systems that deploy sophisticated ML models in a variety of practical scenarios has received considerable amount of attention <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">A major challenge in FL presents when the decentralized data is heterogeneous. Indeed, it is unrealistic to expect that the users participating in a FL system train on data generated from identical distributions – instead, distributions of labels will likely differ between the participating devices. This is particularly pronounced in setting where the training data is limited, possibly to the extent that only a subset of classes is present in the users’ datasets. Since in such scenarios performance of FedAvg may significantly deteriorate, a number of approaches for learning from heterogeneous distributed data has recently been proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. Data heterogeneity in FL systems deploying deep learning networks and training on complex datasets was studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> where a regularization term is introduced in order to impose contrastive learning on local updates, effectively aligning those updates with the global objective. However, as we illustrate in our experiments (see Section <a href="#S4" title="4 EXPERIMENTS ‣ Federated Learning in Non-IID Settings Aided by Differentially Private Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>), this approach fails to perform well on imbalanced data partitions. Difficulties in learning a global model under data heterogeneity have also motivated various clustering and personalization approaches to FL including Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) and its variants that rely on client clustering <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this work we address the challenge of data heterogeneity and scarcity in learning a global model by enabling clients to locally synthesize data using parameters acquired and shared in a privacy-preserving manner. In particular, the proposed <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">federated differentially-private means sharing</span> (FedDPMS) framework allows each client to locally generate synthetic data by relying on means of latent data representations exchanged in differentially-private (DP) manner between clients matched by a trusted server. The server coordinating the training process is assumed to be provided partial information about the clients’ data distributions (in particular, indices of the most abundant and the least abundant classes), and is therefore capable of matching the pairs of clients whose local datasets are complementary. Unlike the existing data augmentation approaches to FL which utilize Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, our proposed framework relies on simple Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) well-suited to the classification tasks of interest. Privacy of sharing the (noisy) means of latent representations is quantified by utilizing the differential privacy mechanism. To test the proposed FedDPMS framework, we conduct extensive numerical studies on image classification tasks using Fashion-MNIST <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. In those experiments FedDPMS outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in settings where the local data comes from diverse distributions.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Approaches to FL that aim to overcome challenges of training a global model on heterogeneous data can be broadly organized in two categories. The first category includes techniques that attempt to improve the model aggregation step performed by the server. Examples include PFNM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>, a Bayesian non-parametric approach for extracting layers from local models and using them to update the corresponding layers in the global model. While PFNM targets relatively simple architectures, FedMA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> takes a step further and extends the same ideas to CNNs and LSTMs. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, the authors present a framework for the analysis of convergence of FL on heterogeneous data, along with a normalized averaging method, FedNova <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, that aims to eliminate objective inconsistencies (i.e., prevent convergence of the global model to a stationary point of the mismatched objectives) caused by naive aggregation of local models. The second category of methods for FL on heterogeneous distributed data is focused on reducing the drift in local training. To this end, FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> introduces a proximal term to the learning objective of each client with the goal of making local training aligned with the global objective.
SCAFFOLD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> utilizes predictive variance reduction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> to introduce control variates and correct local updates. The above two studies were verified in experiments on MNIST and EMINIST with multinomial logistic regression and fully connected two-layer networks. Recently, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> tested FedProx and SCAFFOLD on more challenging tasks that involve deep learning models, showing that those two methods unfortunately offer little to no advantage over FedAvg in the considered scenarios. As an alternative, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> propose the Moon algorithm motivated by the local/global model proximity idea of FedProx but instead of the <math id="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="l_{2}" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.1a"><msub id="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">l</mi><mn id="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">2</mn></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝑙</ci><cn type="integer" id="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">2</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.1c">l_{2}</annotation></semantics></math>-norm term, the proximity is imposed via a contrastive term in the objective of local training.
Another study, FedDyn <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, proposes a dynamic regularizer to promote convergence of the local loss to a stationary point of the global loss. Building on top of SCAFFOLD, FedDC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> introduces an auxiliary local drift variable which serves as a dynamic regularizer helping narrow the gap between local models and the global model. While the above approaches utilize different loss functions, ultimately they all deploy the same strategy of introducing a regularization term to prevent from overfitting in local training.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A set of methods complementary to the techniques in Section <a href="#S2.SS1" title="2.1 Federated Learning on Heterogeneous Data ‣ 2 Related Work ‣ Federated Learning in Non-IID Settings Aided by Differentially Private Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.1</span></a> relies on domain generalization, a method which aims to improve generalization ability of models by training them on data from multiple source domains. Such techniques include FedDG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, a method that allows each client to transfer its amplitude spectrum, decomposed from raw data, to a bank at the server. The server shares the collected amplitude spectrum with all clients, enabling them to synthesize new distribution via interpolation and helping improve local training. However, FedDG is unable to enrich class diversity since the phase spectrum is not shared due to privacy concerns. Another study, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, employs zero-shot data augmentation and relies on the statistics of the batch normalization (BN) layers to reduce the variance of test accuracy. FedMix <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> presents a framework for sharing clients’ averaged local data via Mixup <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>; privacy of clients in FedMix may still be compromised since the only effort to protect it is based on averaging raw data. FedDA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> utilizes the attention mechanism <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> to enable the server to aggregate local per-label knowledge and create global per-label knowledge, ultimately enabling data augmentation via conditional variational autoencoder <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. However, aggregation of per-label knowledge in highly non-iid setting (e.g., only a few classes are present in the local dataset) presents the same challenge: local per-label knowledge is drifting from the expectation of the global per-label knowledge. FedDPMS aims to address this problem by matching pairs of client and generating complementary data using shared mean of latent representations.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Both existing approaches to dealing with data heterogeneity – improving model aggregation at the server and reducing model drift in local training – struggle when the differences between local data distributions are significant (e.g., the clients completely missing some class labels). To this end, in this paper we propose an alternative framework that aims to provide privacy-preserving domain generalization by enhancing and balancing local datasets. In particular, FedDPMS relies on sharing differentially-private information needed to generate representative synthetic data – specifically, the clients share noisy versions of averaged latent representations that their encoders extract from local data. Since the proposed framework facilitates learning in non-iid settings by enriching the diversity of clients’ data, it does not compete with the prior work in Section <a href="#S2" title="2 Related Work ‣ Federated Learning in Non-IID Settings Aided by Differentially Private Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> – instead, FedDPMS is complementary to and may potentially be combined with the existing methods for FL on non-iid distributed data.

<p id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.12" class="ltx_p">Recall that in this stage clients update the encoder and classifier by optimizing the cross-entropy between a prediction and the ground truth while disregarding the divergence and reconstruction loss; these updates are formed by training on augmented datasets. For the sake of computation and communication efficiency, each selected client shares its means of latent data representations and augments the local dataset only once, regardless of how many times the client is selected by the server; as our results demonstrate, this is sufficient to improve the performance of the learned model. To avoid repeating information sharing / dataset augmentation, the server maintains four sets: (1) the set of clients who shared information (i.e. who encoded original data into latent representations

While our experiments demonstrate remarkable performance improvements of FedDPMS over competing methods despite providing a client in need of synthetic data with the latent representation of only one of its peers, the matching algorithm can readily be extended to identifying several “assisting” clients for a “benefitting” client. The proposed method for client matching is formalized as Matching Algorithm in supplementary material section 3.

There are two benefits of adding the noise: first, it introduces diversity in the synthetically generated data; and, second, it endues the shared information with differential privacy (more on differential privacy in the next section). The noisy corruption of latent representation means, however, may be so severe to result in unusable synthesized data; we would like to identify if this is the case before the client communicates such means to the server. To this end, the client applies the global decoder <math id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.32.m32.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathbf{w_{d}}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.32.m32.1a"><msub id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.32.m32.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.32.m32.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.32.m32.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.32.m32.1.1.2.cmml">𝐰</mi><mi id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.32.m32.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.32.m32.1.1.3.cmml">𝐝</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.32.m32.1b"><apply id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.32.m32.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.32.m32.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.32.m32.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.32.m32.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.32.m32.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.32.m32.1.1.2">𝐰</ci><ci id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.32.m32.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.32.m32.1.1.3">𝐝</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.32.m32.1c">\mathbf{w_{d}}</annotation></semantics></math> and utilizes the (highly accurate) local classifier <math id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.33.m33.2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="w_{c,i}^{t}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.33.m33.2a"><msubsup id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.33.m33.2.3" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.33.m33.2.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.33.m33.2.3.2.2" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.33.m33.2.3.2.2.cmml">w</mi><mrow id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.33.m33.2.2.2.4" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.33.m33.2.2.2.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.33.m33.1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.33.m33.1.1.1.1.cmml">c</mi><mo id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.33.m33.2.2.2.4.1" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.33.m33.2.2.2.3.cmml">,</mo><mi id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.33.m33.2.2.2.2" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.33.m33.2.2.2.2.cmml">i</mi></mrow><mi id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.33.m33.2.3.3" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.33.m33.2.3.3.cmml">t</mi></msubsup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.33.m33.2b"><apply id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.33.m33.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.33.m33.2.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.33.m33.2.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.33.m33.2.3">superscript</csymbol><apply id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.33.m33.2.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.33.m33.2.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.33.m33.2.3.2.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.33.m33.2.3">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.33.m33.2.3.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.33.m33.2.3.2.2">𝑤</ci><list id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.33.m33.2.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.33.m33.2.2.2.4"><ci id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.33.m33.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.33.m33.1.1.1.1">𝑐</ci><ci id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.33.m33.2.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.33.m33.2.2.2.2">𝑖</ci></list></apply><ci id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.33.m33.2.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.33.m33.2.3.3">𝑡</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.33.m33.2c">w_{c,i}^{t}</annotation></semantics></math> to attempt recognizing the reconstructed data point.

<p id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">It is worth pointing out that the assisting and benefiting clients each utilize their respective <span id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">local</span>

Such a strategy is desirable for two reasons. First, the local classifier achieves performance superior to the global classifier since the latter is agglomerated from local models that may have drifted apart; therefore, local classifiers are more trustworthy decision-makers for selecting usable noisy means. Second, we encode raw data using the local encoder of the assisting client but decode the latent representation means with the global decoder at the benefiting client; this helps separate the benefiting client’s synthetic data from the assisting client’s raw data in a way that is complementary to the separation induced by averaging latent information or adding noise. While its impact appears challenging to formalize analytically, such a strategy intuitively helps protect the assisting client’s privacy.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.p2.13" class="ltx_p">While prior work on data augmentation in federated learning relied on data averaging for privacy protection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>, differential attacks may be used to extract individual information from the averages. This motivates using concepts from differential privacy to quantify the privacy provided by noisy perturbations that FedDPMS injects into latent means. In related prior work, a number of methods that attempt to prevent privacy leaks from uploaded local gradients or models have been proposed in literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. These methods can readily be adapted to model training and client matching in FedDPMS. For simplicity, in this paper we limit our attention to characterizing differential privacy of sharing noisy latent means.

The takeaway from competitive performance of FedMix on FMNIST, but poor on both CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, is that utilizing interpolation to synthesize samples from raw data succeeds on simple datasets but does not on more complex ones; moreover, the approach deployed by FedMix is risky in terms of potential privacy leaks. In all, the experiments demonstrate consistently best performance of FedDPMS across different data distributions and levels of heterogeneity.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Data heterogeneity is a critical challenge hindering practical federated learning systems, potentially causing major performance deterioration. We propose a novel framework, FedDPMS, aiming to enable accurate and robust performance of federated deep learning models trained on heterogeneous distributed datasets. This is accomplished by sharing differentially-private information which the clients use to enrich local datasets and thus combat the local model drift. As our experimental results demonstrate, FedDPMS outperforms state-of-the-art federated learning methods on image classification tasks with varied levels of heterogeneity across clients while requiring only a minor increase in communication cost. FedDPMS does requires additional computation and memory resources, the amount of which depends on the specifics of the training process. In applications where the high accuracy is imperative, FedDPMS provides an attractive and effective framework for overcoming challenges presented by data heterogeneity.
