<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">We analyze knowledge-based visual question answering, for which given a question, the models need to ground it into the visual modality and retrieve the relevant knowledge from a given large knowledge base (KB) to be able to answer. Our analysis has two folds, one based on designing neural architectures and training them from scratch, and another based on large pre-trained language models (LLMs). Our research questions are: 1) Can we effectively augment models by explicit supervised retrieval of the relevant KB information to solve the KB-VQA problem? 2) How do task-specific and LLM-based models perform in the integration of visual and external knowledge, and multi-hop reasoning over both sources of information?
3) Is the implicit knowledge of LLMs sufficient for KB-VQA and to what extent it can replace the explicit KB?
Our results demonstrate the positive impact of empowering task-specific and LLM models with supervised external and visual knowledge retrieval models. Our findings show that though LLMs are stronger in 1-hop reasoning, they suffer in 2-hop reasoning in comparison with our fine-tuned NN model even if the relevant information from both modalities is available to the model.
Moreover, we observed that LLM models outperform the NN model for KB-related questions which confirms the effectiveness of implicit knowledge in LLMs however, they do not alleviate the need for external KB.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Visual Question Answering (VQA) aims to answer a question in natural language form while visual information is needed to provide the correct answer. Though over the past years, the progress in this field has been remarkable, existing models still suffer in answering the questions requiring knowledge beyond the image. These models suffer from lacking extra knowledge integration or integrating noisy knowledge in their reasoning procedure even when the source of required knowledge is given. This problem is formulated as the so-called KB-VQA where in addition to the question and image, the source of external knowledge is given as input.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">There have been various efforts to include external knowledge in the VQA task. These methods have two basic steps, retrieving related knowledge entries from the given knowledge bases, e.g., Wikipedia and ConceptNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Liu and Singh (<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2004</a>)</cite>, and predicting the final answer by integrating this extracted external information, and question, and visual data. However, these retrieval-based approaches suffer from two weaknesses: (i) They use some heuristics like keyword matching for retrieval, and there is no guarantee for retrieving semantically relevant knowledge and (ii) the knowledge graphs are very dense, and plenty of irrelevant knowledge is retrieved even if the required knowledge is retrieved. These irrelevant entries mislead the reasoning procedure.
Since current information retrieval methods are based on simple heuristics and there is no guarantee for their retrieval accuracy, they hurt the final VQA results by retrieving irrelevant or noisy facts <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Marino et al. (<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>); Li and Moens (<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">With the introduction of the pre-trained large-scale language models and their vast power in solving various tasks, recent approaches aimed to use the implicit knowledge accumulated in these models, such as GPT-3 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Brown et al. (<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. These models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Hu et al. (<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>); Shao et al. (<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>); Yang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> performed many efforts to use LLMs and guide commonsense reasoning in VQA models. Despite their remarkable results, these methods lack powerful vision processing and suffer from hallucination.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we propose to train a supervised knowledge retrieval model using the provided meta-data in the KRVQA dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Cao et al. (<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. Our retrieval method uses contrastive loss to maximize the similarity of a question embedding with the embedding of its supporting facts while minimizing its similarity to irrelevant facts. Moreover, we assume the corresponding scene graph (SG) of the image is given and utilize a similar retrieval module to extract the question-relevant visual information from the SG. In other words, we formulate both external knowledge and visual knowledge integration as retrieval tasks. Next, we integrate both external and visual retrieved knowledge to find the final answer through multiple hops of reasoning.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We roughly divide recent VQA approaches into three groups as follows. The first group, plain VQA methods, focus on question and image integration approaches without including any extra information. The second group aims to feed extra information extracted from external knowledge bases in VQA models.
In the last group of SOTA VQA models, we review methods that rely on the power of the pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) as implicit sources of knowledge for KB-VQA tasks.

Their model can improve marginally while suffering from huge memory and time demands.

Next, we replace our raw image with its corresponding scene graph and propose a similar contrastive-loss optimization method to retrieve the relevant visual information. We used the human-annotated scene graphs to represent the given visual data. For more information on the scene graph extraction and representation, one can check Appendix, section <a href="#S7.SS1" title="7.1 Scene Graph Computation ‣ 7 Appendix ‣ Find The Gap: Knowledge Base Reasoning For Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7.1</span></a>.

However, the first group has been trained on a limited amount of KB data, and the RGCN family suffers from memory issues for data with a huge number of relations, and it only can learn embedding for entities and not for relations. Due to the availability of strong efficient pretrained text-encoders, we used Roberta <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Liu et al.

<p id="S4.SS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Our NN model has made more than 13% improvements in comparison with the best NN model, DMMGR, which uses key-value memory networks to combine external knowledge in VQA tasks. This result is not a fair comparison though since we provide the ground-truth SG but our goal is to show the impact of supervised knowledge retrieval conditioned on access to the complete SG and KB. This result demonstrates the positive impact of training a supervised knowledge retrieval module for both external and visual knowledge besides a strong reasoning module to avoid noise propagation and enrich the model to perform better reasoning. The results show that enriching a base LLM model (Promptcap) by adding retrieved knowledge makes a significant improvement in accuracy, though still, a fine-tuned reasoning module leads to higher accuracy than LLM-based model.</p>

The remarkable improvement made by adding retrieved scene graph triplets demonstrates the importance of representing visual data in a high-level format instead of a low-level and abstract feature format.</p>

Moreover, by comparing the accuracy using the retrieval model versus the upper limit of accuracy using ground truth triplets, our retrieval methods hurt more for question types 2,3, and 5. We conjecture that retrieving relevant facts is harder when the head entity is missing. As shown in Table <a href="#S4.T6" title="Table 6 ‣ 4.5 Question-type Analysis ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ Find The Gap: Knowledge Base Reasoning For Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, for our retrieval-based model, KB-related questions are harder than non-KB-related models, although our retrieval accuracy for both SG and KB is similar. Moreover, the NN model has similar accuracy for 1-hop and 2-hop questions.</p>

<p id="S4.SS5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Results show that question types 3 and 5 are harder for the LLM model even in the presence of ground-truth knowledge. Since for question types 3 and 5, the answer belongs to the second hop, it might make reasoning more complicated and prone to noise. Another interesting result is that almost for all one-hop questions LLM beats the NN model, though for 2-hop questions it performs worse than NN which confirms the weakness of LLM models in multi-hop reasoning.
In Table <a href="#S4.T6" title="Table 6 ‣ 4.5 Question-type Analysis ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ Find The Gap: Knowledge Base Reasoning For Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, we can see that the LLM models work better than their corresponding NN models for KB-related questions which confirms the partial existence of implicit knowledge in LLMs.</p>

Moreover, We reported the effect of injecting retrieved knowledge vs the ground-truth knowledge which indicates the oracle setting and upper-bound for our models.
The NN-None model only integrates question representation with image CLIP representation, while the LLM-None model does not use any knowledge in the prompts.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We proposed a retrieval and reasoning framework for knowledge-based visual question answering. We trained a contrastive-loss model to retrieve supporting facts from external knowledge as well as from the scene graph. We used the KRVQA dataset, the largest existing VQA dataset, to train both retriever and reasoning modules.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our results show the positive impact of empowering task-specific and LLM models with retrieved external and visual knowledge.
We investigated the strength of the task-specific and LLM models in multi-hop reasoning, as well as integrating visual and KB reasoning. Our results show that though LLMs are stronger than the fine-tuned NN model in 1-hop reasoning, they suffer in 2-hop reasoning even in the presence of the supporting knowledge from both modalities. This highlights the importance of using a strong module for the integration of both sources of information and performing complex reasoning.
We found that LLM models outperform the NN model for KB-related questions which confirms the effectiveness of implicit knowledge in LLMs, however, they do not alleviate the need for external KB.</p>

We have trained our scene graph generation method using the training data introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Xu et al. (<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> (VG150). VG150 includes the most frequent 150 object categories and 50 predicates of the VG dataset. We use 70% of the images for training and the remaining 30% for testing. We generated scene graphs using both VS3 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Zhang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> which used GLIP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Li et al. (<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> as a building block for object and feature recognition, as well as the scene graph benchmark proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Tang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. Unfortunately, scene graph detection quality is low, and error propagation from scene graph generation hampers the retrieval accuracy from 60% to around 19% (as shown in table <a href="#S4.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 4.3 Retrieval Result ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ Find The Gap: Knowledge Base Reasoning For Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>). Therefore, we use Visual Genome provided scene graphs in our work to avoid error propagation from the scene graph to the next steps of the model and have a better analysis of the strengths and limitations of our retrieval and reasoning model.</p>
