<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Machine learning makes multimedia data (e.g., images) more attractive, however, multimedia data is usually distributed and privacy sensitive.
Multiple distributed multimedia clients can resort to federated learning (FL) to jointly learn a global shared model without requiring to share their private samples with any third-party entities.
In this paper, we show that FL suffers from the cross-client generative adversarial networks (GANs)-based (C-GANs) attack, in which a malicious client (i.e., adversary) can reconstruct samples with the same distribution as the training samples from other clients (i.e., victims).
Since a benign client’s data can be leaked to the adversary, this attack brings the risk of local data leakage for clients in many security-critical FL applications.
Thus, we propose Fed-EDKD (i.e., Federated Ensemble Data-free Knowledge Distillation) technique to improve the current popular FL schemes to resist C-GANs attack.
In Fed-EDKD, each client submits a local model to the server for obtaining an ensemble global model.
Then, to avoid model expansion, Fed-EDKD adopts data-free knowledge distillation techniques to transfer knowledge from the ensemble global model to a compressed model.
By this way, Fed-EDKD reduces the adversary’s control capability over the global model, so Fed-EDKD can effectively mitigate C-GANs attack.
Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that Fed-EDKD significantly mitigates C-GANs attack while only incurring a slight accuracy degradation of FL.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Nowadays, machine learning (ML) technology is extensively applied to various fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition, etc.
A good ML model requires a large amount of multimedia data (e.g., images, text, audio, etc.) for training to ensure high performance.
In practice, a large training dataset is usually collected by a group of distributed multimedia devices, such as computers, laptops, smartphones and other electronic sensors.
Meanwhile, these multimedia devices are generating large amounts of data all the time.
The traditional approach is to let many distributed multimedia clients send their local datasets to a centralized server for training.
However, the clients’ local datasets may contain sensitive data (e.g., personal biometric data, location data, commercial valuable data, etc.) so that the clients may not want to share them with others.
Therefore, how to protect the privacy of the clients has become an urgent concern.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To address the security problems, federated learning (FL) technique is proposed, which enables a group of distributed clients to collaboratively train an ML model with the help of a central server for coordination.
In FL, each client only shares local model updates, and does not need to share its local dataset with others, and therefore, their local data privacy is preserved.
Therefore, FL applications are widely used in various distributed, privacy sensitive scenarios <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
Current popular federated learning techniques (e.g., FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, FedProx<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, SCAFFOLD<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, and MOON<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>) require multiple interactions between clients and server to train a global ML model.
After sufficient training, a global ML model can be obtained.
A similar technique is collaborative learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, which can be classified as sequential collaborative learning and parallel collaborative learning.
In sequential collaborative learning, global ML model is trained on each client in sequential order.
Usually, parallel collaborative learning is also named FL.
In FL, clients’ local model updates are sent to the central server where these updates are averaged to update the global model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">A recent study shows that sequential collaborative learning is vulnerable to GANs-based data reconstruction attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
In this attack, a malicious client (i.e., the adversary) can apply adversarial influence to the learning process and utilize the shared model as the discriminator to secretly train GANs for reconstructing samples with the same distribution as victim’s private samples.
While the adversarial influence applied may become trivial after the average update in FL.
Because of the difference between the sequential collaborative learning and the parallel collaborative learning (i.e., FL), we aim to test the performance of this attack in FL.
In this paper, inspired by the above attack, we design a <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">C</span>ross-client <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">GANs</span>-based (C-GANs) attack in FL.
In C-GANs attack, a malicious client (i.e., adversary) does not own the data of a target class.
Our experiments show that C-GANs attack enables the adversary to reconstruct samples with the same distribution as the training samples of the target class, so the adversary can easily learn the private information of other clients’ local data.
Recall that FL is designed to protect each client’s local dataset from other entities.
However, C-GANs attack brings the risk of local data leakage for clients in many security-critical FL applications.
For example, a malicious client can reconstruct the face image belonging to other clients in FL.
Since C-GANs attack breaks the validity of the traditional FL scheme, how to mitigate C-GANs attack is identified as one of the most fundamental problems in FL.
Thus, it is imperative to revise the traditional FL scheme to mitigate C-GANs attack.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In C-GANs attack, the adversary trains GANs by utilizing the shared global model and does not need to access other clients’ gradients.
Therefore, based on secure multi-party computing and homomorphic encryption, the known schemes for protecting gradients in FL are ineffective for against C-GANs attack.
To mitigate GANs-based attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> in collaborative learning, two solutions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> have been proposed, however, both of them suffer from some limitations.
Chen et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> proposed a solution to isolate the participants from the global model parameters during FL training.
Its major limitation is to assume the existence of an additional trust third party.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, GANs are trained to generate fake samples participating in collaborative learning to protect the original training data.
There are two limitations in this approach, first, it leads to relatively high performance degradation, second, training GANs costs intensive computational overhead on clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we improve the traditional FL scheme and further propose <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Fed</span>erated <span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">E</span>nsemble <span id="S1.p5.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">D</span>ata-free <span id="S1.p5.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">K</span>nowledge <span id="S1.p5.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">D</span>istillation scheme (named Fed-EDKD) to mitigate C-GANs attack.
In Fed-EDKD design, we adopt the ensemble learning technique <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, which enables each client to submit a local learned ML model to the central server.
The server can combine the received local models to obtain a global model with better predictive performance.
By using ensemble learning in federated learning, a malicious client can only manipulate its local ML model, so the malicious client’s control capability over the global ML model is significantly reduced.
Therefore, Fed-EDKD can effectively mitigate the C-GANs attack.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">There are three major technical challenges in Fed-EDKD to be addressed.
First, general ensemble federated learning only requires single client-server iteration <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, so Fed-EDKD may lead to a large performance degradation of global model.
To minimize the performance degradation, Fed-EDKD adopts multiple iterations for training a global model with high predictive performance.
After the server combines the global model using ensemble strategy, the server distributes it to each client.
In the next iteration, each client can use the received global model to do local training and submit it to the server for ensemble learning again.
After multiple iterations, the predictive performance of the trained global model by Fed-EDKD can be significantly increased.
Second, it is challenging to handle the global model expansion issue.
If we use the above multiple-iteration strategy, then the size of global model is expanded in each iteration (because the standalone ensemble global model has larger size than each local model).
To solve this challenge, Fed-EDKD exploits knowledge distillation (KD) technique, which transfers the knowledge from the large ensemble model (teacher model) to a smaller compressed student model.
Therefore, the model expansion issue can be solved.
Third, it is challenging to achieve highly precise KD when the training data is absent on the central server.
In FL, the server is prohibited to access the clients’ training data, so it is hard to perform highly precise KD.
To tackle this challenge, Fed-EDKD employs the data-free KD technique.
A generator is trained to produce the imitated training data, which can facilitate the knowledge transfer from the teacher model to the student model.
Hence, the highly precise KD can be accomplished by the server without accessing real training data of clients.

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Although clients only share their gradient information in collaborative learning, it is still vulnerable to various attacks including data reconstruction attack, membership inference attack, backdoor attack, and attribute inference attack.
Data reconstruction attack aims to reconstruct images of the same distribution from participating clients.
Wang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> present a method that assumes a malicious server and incorporates GANs with a multi-task discriminator to infer class representatives of a certain client.
But this method only works under certain circumstances where the reconstructed data is mostly homogeneous across clients and shared updates are plaintext.
Fredrikson et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> proposed a method, which can roughly reconstruct a victim’s face image from a block model with only given a name.
Although it works well for MLP, it is not ideal for CNNs.
Furthermore, Zhu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> proposed DLG to reconstruct training samples by optimizing the random input to generate the same gradients for a specific client.
iDLG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> improves the efficiency of DLG.
However, these two methods are effective only if the shared gradients are plaintext and become invalid when the batch consists of many samples.
The membership inference attack is to infer whether a given sample is in the training dataset or not.
Shokri et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> proposed the membership inference attack against a well-trained model by utilizing the differences in the target model’s predictions on trained inputs and that not trained.
Studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> extend the membership inference attack to federated learning.
Backdoor attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> utilizes the well-designed gradients (sent to the server) to modify the global model in the last round, so the adversary can insert backdoor functionality into the joint trained model.
Attribute inference attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> utilizes the shared model updates to infer sensitive attributes of training data. (e.g., specific locations).</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Existing privacy-preserving collaborative learning methods can be categorized into four types : differential privacy (DP), secure multi-party computing (SMC), homomorphic encryption (HE) and robust aggregation.
DP introduces a certain amount of randomness or noise in the output to mask the user’s influence on the output <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
Shokri et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> first proposed collaborative deep learning at realistic distribution and realized DP on it.
Recently, Robin et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> proposed client-level differential privacy-preserving federated optimization to further protect the information of clients.
However, these DP-based methods make the train process are difficult to converge and realize a desirable privacy-performance tradeoff.
In addition, SMC has also been applied to protect the shared updates in privacy-preserving collaborative learning.
The SMC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> security model involved multiple parties and guaranteed complete zero-knowledge, that is, each party knew nothing except input and output.
The authors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> utilized SMC to design a secure ML framework with two servers and semi-honest assumptions.
Besides, SMC technique is used in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> for model training and verification without revealing sensitive attributes of users.
Homomorphic encryption is a form of encryption that enables users to perform computations on their encrypted data without first decrypting it and the results of decryption produce the same output as if the operation are performed on the unencrypted data.
Recently, Jing et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> proposed a multi-key homomorphic encryption protocol to protect the shared gradients in FL.
Truex et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> proposed a method combining DP and SMC that enables FL to reduce the growth of noise injection as the number of clients increases without sacrificing privacy while maintaining a pre-defined rate of trust.
However, both these SMC-based and HE-based methods will cost unbearable computational and communication overhead.
Robust aggregation improves the resilience of aggregation algorithms by carefully choosing the local model updates for aggregation, or balances updates from malicious clients by adding noise to the aggregation model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.
On the other hand, various anomaly detection methods have been proposed to identify malicious clients’ local model updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>.</p>

Federated learning is a distributed ML technique that enables training an algorithm across multiple distributed clients holding local dataset, without exchanging them.
There are two types of entities (a central server and multiple clients) in the FL system model.
At each iteration, clients download the global model from the central server, and then train it locally using its local dataset according to the initially agreed upon common algorithm.
Then, these local model updates (i.e., the difference between the local model and the global model) are sent to the central server where these updates are averaged to update the global model, and then the updated global model is redistributed to the clients for the next iteration.
The above processes are performed in multiple iterations and terminate until the ML model is well-trained.</p>

GANs are first proposed by Goodfellow et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>.
GANs are a method of unsupervised learning, where two neural networks learn by playing against each other.

Given the similarity between the sequential collaborative learning and the parallel collaborative learning (i.e., FL), we intend to test the cross-client GANs-based (C-GANs) attack performance in FL.
In the following, we first introduce the threat model and some details of C-GANs attack.
The experimental evaluation for C-GANs attack is presented in Section <a href="#S7" title="VII EXPERIMENTS ‣ Mitigating Cross-client GANs-based Attack in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VII</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The adversary is assumed to be one of the clients in FL.
The central server follows the FL protocol.
We consider the adversary does not own the data of a target label.
The goal of the adversary is to reconstruct samples with the same distribution as the target label’s samples as accurately as possible.
Therefore, the victim(s) may be one or multiple clients who own the data with the target label.
Besides, the adversary can adaptively upload specially-crafted updates to trick other clients into leaking more information on their local data.
The leaked information can help the adversary to reconstruct the target label’s samples.
Note that the adversary’s attack is performed without changing the FL process, so this attack is carried out stealthily.</p>

We find that C-GANs attack can indeed break the ability of federated learning to protect client data privacy.
Moreover, C-GANs attack is successful both in FedAvg algorithm or other state-of-the-art FL algorithms, such as FedProx<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, SCAFFOLD<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, and MOON<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.

In Fed-EDKD, the server stores each client’s local model in the previous round.
After receiving the updates from clients, the server can get its latest model.
The server combines each client’s latest model (as shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F2.sf1" title="In Figure 2 ‣ V-A Key Ideas in Mitigating C-GANs Attack ‣ V Fed-EDKD Overview ‣ Mitigating Cross-client GANs-based Attack in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2(a)</span></a>) and gets the ensemble global model.
Then, the server adopts the data-free knowledge distillation technique to distill the knowledge from the ensemble global model into the student model, which is described in Section <a href="#S6" title="VI Data-free Knowledge Distillation ‣ Mitigating Cross-client GANs-based Attack in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VI</span></a> in detail.
The student model is set to be the same size as the original model, so the model expansion problem can be avoided.
Next, the server sends the compressed student model to each client for the next round of training.
After multiple rounds of training, the student model is well trained and used as the final ML model.</p>

The server is responsible for data-free knowledge distillation (line 8).
For ClientUpdate (lines 13-17), Fed-EDKD is the same as FedAvg.
Therefore, Fed-EDKD does not require any protocol modification from the client-side.
During the server execution, the server distributes the latest global model to all clients and collects each client’s updated latest local model (lines 5-6).
Then, the server utilizes DataFreeKD (line 8) to distill the knowledge from the ensemble global model (combined with each client’s latest local model) into the student model (treated as the global model for the next round).</p>

Compared with FedAvg, Fed-EDKD can be used for dealing with another problem: it offers model heterogeneity accommodation.
Even if the local models submitted from clients are heterogeneous with different network depths, these models can still be combined and compressed at the server.
Comparing with the ensemble distillation scheme in FedDF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, Fed-EDKD has one biggest advantage that the central server does not need an unlabeled auxiliary dataset.
Note that this paper mainly discusses the security performance of Fed-EDKD, so the experimental verification of model heterogeneity is not presented in this paper.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Directly using the ensemble strategy has some issues.
First, if the ensemble global model is viewed as a standalone model and it is sent to each client, then the model expands in each server-client training round.
Second, if the server directly sends the ensemble global model to each client for the next round of training, the other client’s local models are leaked to all clients.
This may lead to security concerns.</p>

<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To address the issues incurred by the ensemble strategy, Fed-EDKD exploits knowledge distillation technique.
This technique enables the server to distill the knowledge of the ensemble global model into a compressed student network (with the same size as clients’ local model).
Then, the compressed student model is sent to clients for the next round of training.
Therefore, the model expansion issue is solved.
Besides, each client’s local models are merged into a single compressed model, so the model leakage issue is effectively alleviated.
In the following, the knowledge distillation technique developed in Fed-EDKD is introduced in details.</p>

<p id="S6.SS2.p2.2" class="ltx_p">Although data-free KD schemes are not novel to the federated learning community, they are not very useful to mitigate C-GANs attack.
FedGen <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> trains a lightweight generator to generate simulation feature and broadcasts it to clients to guide local training.
FedFTG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> learns a generator to explore the input space of local models to relieve the issue of direct model aggregation.
Both of the two methods aim to extract some useful information from the uploaded updates from clients to guide the training process, but, they did not make an effort to defense against the adversary in C-GANs attack.
In Fed-EDKD, we adopt the ensemble strategy to mitigate C-GANs attack.
Thus, we need to design a special data-free KD scheme.
To address this issue, we design a data-free KD scheme used in Fed-EDKD, which is inspired by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>.

To demonstrate whether C-GANs attack is effective against the state-of-the-art federated learning algorithm, we apply C-GANs attack on several FL variants including FedAvg, FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, SCAFFOLD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, and MOON <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.

Compared with Fed-EDKD, additive noise requires a larger drop in accuracy to successfully defense against C-GANs attack.
The gradient clipping can also successfully resist C-GANs attack and only bring a slight accuracy degradation.
The accuracy of the trained global model by Fed-EDKD in IID case is nearly 98.5% (in the next subsection), and that by gradient clipping is approaching 97%.
In addition, we evaluate different levels of sparsity on updates (range from 10% to 90%).
Although the higher sparsity does not lead to a noticeable drop in accuracy, it has almost no effects against C-GANs attack.</p>

We have the following observations, first, in both IID and Non-IID cases, C-GANs attack enables the adversary to successfully reconstruct visually recognizable images in FedAvg, second, the reconstructed images follow the same distribution as the images of the target label from victims.
To verify the effectiveness of Fed-EDKD defending C-GANs attack, we repeat the above experiments on Fed-EDKD.
Compared with the results in FedAvg, Fig <a href="#S7.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ VII-B Evaluation of Fed-EDKD ‣ VII EXPERIMENTS ‣ Mitigating Cross-client GANs-based Attack in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> (the last two rows) shows that most of the images reconstructed by C-GANs attack are significantly blurred when using Fed-EDKD.

The first row shows some of the real images from the victim (each image is one of the face images from one target class).
The second row is the reconstructed images (subjectively selected the corresponding image that is most similar to the victim’s image) by C-GANs attack in FedAvg case.
The third row is the reconstructed images by C-GANs attack when Fed-EDKD is used.
We can observe that the reconstructed images by C-GANs attack in FedAvg contain the same characteristics as the real images from the victim, such as wearing glasses (first image).
Although the second row reconstructed images have a certain distortion compared with the real data, it is easy for ones to infer private information from the reconstructed images.
For the reconstructed images in the third row, almost all features are lost so that they cannot be distinguished what they are.
These confirm that Fed-EDKD can mitigate C-GANs attack.</p>

The comparison experiments are conducted on MNIST in IID and Non-IID cases.
The test accuracy of the well-trained global model trained by FedAvg in the IID case is nearly 99.2%, and that by Fed-EDKD is approaching 98.5%.
The test accuracy of the well-trained global model trained by FedAvg in the Non-IID case is nearly 97.9%, and that by Fed-EDKD is approaching 94.7%.
The test accuracy of the trained ML model is only reduced by 0.7% in the IID case and is reduced by 3.2% in the Non-IID case.
Thus, Fed-EDKD only incurs a slight accuracy degradation on the trained global model compared with FedAvg.</p>

This also demonstrates that the malicious client’s control capability over the global ML model is significantly reduce in Fed-EDKD.
In the Non-IID case, <a href="#S7.F9.sf2" title="In Figure 9 ‣ VII-B Evaluation of Fed-EDKD ‣ VII EXPERIMENTS ‣ Mitigating Cross-client GANs-based Attack in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9(b)</span></a> shows that C-GANs attack did not have a noticeable impact both on FedAvg and Fed-EDKD.</p>

To evaluate the loss of knowledge (i.e., model accuracy) during the distillation process, we test the accuracy of ensemble model (teacher model) and compare it with the accuracy of distillation model (student model).
As shown in Fig. <a href="#S7.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ VII-B Evaluation of Fed-EDKD ‣ VII EXPERIMENTS ‣ Mitigating Cross-client GANs-based Attack in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>, the accuracy curve of ensemble model(i.e., purple curve) and the accuracy curve of distillation model(i.e., blue curve) are very close.
The test accuracy of ensemble model in the IID case is nearly 98.82%, and that of distillation model is approaching 98.5%.
Furthermore, the test accuracy of the ensemble model in the Non-IID case is nearly 95.69%, and that of distillation model is approaching 94.7%.
The test accuracy of distillation model is only reduced by no more than 1%.

<div id="S7.SS2.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS2.p7.1" class="ltx_p">In Fed-EDKD, there is no modification on the client-side operation, while the server-side operations are updated.
We evaluate the computational costs of client and server on several different FL algorithms, which is depicted in Table <a href="#S7.T5" title="TABLE V ‣ VII-B Evaluation of Fed-EDKD ‣ VII EXPERIMENTS ‣ Mitigating Cross-client GANs-based Attack in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">V</span></a>.
As expected, in Fed-EDKD, the computational cost of a client is nearly the same with FedAvg and SCAFFOLD, because their protocols on the client-side are almost identical.
Furthermore, the computational cost of the server in Fed-EDKD is much higher than other schemes.
The root cause is that the data-free knowledge distillation operation in Fed-EDKD requires more computation overhead.
However, the extra computational cost incurred by Fed-EDKD is not a big issue.
First, since the server (e.g., cloud server) is usually much more powerful in FL.
We can assign more computing resources to the server to accelerate its computation in real-world applications if needed.
Second, most FL applications are not real-time, so waiting for several minutes to perform one iteration is acceptable.
In conclusion, Fed-EDKD works by investing more computations to gain security.</p>

<p id="S7.SS2.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Comparing the experiments on the above three datasets, we have the following observations.
For the performance of C-GANs attack, if the samples of the target class distribute closer to each other, then C-GANs attack reconstructed samples can leak more information to the adversary.
For example, different images with label “1” (in MNIST dataset) distribute closer to each other, whereas different images with label “automobile” (in CIFAR-10 dataset) distribute relatively faraway to each other.
Consequently, C-GANs attack has better performance on MNIST dataset than that on CIFAR-10 dataset.
Note that C-GANs attack only works well on the dataset in which the data distribute close to each other for a given class, but there are already many data types that have such a property.
For example, many biometric datasets (e.g., face image datasets, fingerprint datasets, iris datasets, etc) have such a property.
Thus, the C-GANs attack indeed imposes serious threats to FL.
For the performance of Fed-EDKD, our experiments demonstrate that Fed-EDKD is capable of mitigating C-GANs attack in FL on different datasets.
The adversary reconstructed samples are highly blurred via using Fed-EDKD, which means Fed-EDKD mitigates the C-GANs attack.
Furthermore, Fed-EDKD only incurs a slight performance degradation.
For example, on MINIST dataset, the test accuracy of the trained ML model is only reduced by 0.7% from 99.2% (using FedAvg) to 98.5% (using Fed-EDKD) in the IID case.</p>

Fed-EDKD can mitigate data poisoning attacks in FL.
Based on the ensemble strategy used in Fed-EDKD, poisonous updates (incurred by poisoning data) also can be mitigated when the number of malicious clients is limited.</p>

<p id="S8.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S8.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Extra Computational Cost.</span>
Fed-EDKD needs more computational cost on the server.
Since the server (e.g., cloud server) is usually much more powerful than client-side devices, the extra computation cost is acceptable.
This observation follows a commonly seen principle: security is not free.
Fed-EDKD pays the computational cost in order to gain security in FL.</p>

<p id="S9.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we tested the C-GANs attack performance in FL and found conditions under which the attack has good/poor performance.
Furthermore, we improve the traditional FL scheme and further propose Fed-EDKD to mitigate C-GANs attack.
The main idea of Fed-EDKD is to adopt the ensemble learning scheme in FL to reduce malicious clients’ control capability over the global ML model.
First, the server combines the received client models and obtains an ensemble global model using the ensemble strategy.
Then, we employ the knowledge distillation technique to transfer the knowledge from the large ensemble model to a smaller compressed student model which has the same size as the original model.
Therefore, the student model can perform multiple iterations of training between clients and server, which can obtain high performance of the global model.
Besides, we exploit the data-free knowledge distillation technique to solve the challenge of lacking real training data.
Specifically, a generator is trained to produce the imitated training data to facilitate the knowledge transfer from the teacher to the student mode.
Finally, intensive simulations have demonstrated the effectiveness and superiorities of Fed-EDKD.
Fed-EDKD has the following impacts.
First, Fed-EDKD significantly mitigates C-GANs attack on two datasets while only incurring a slight accuracy degradation of FL.
Second, Fed-EDKD can achieve higher performance without sacrificing security compared with several defense strategies (e.g., differential privacy, additive noise, etc).
Third, the ideas proposed in Fed-EDKD can have broader impacts since they can be used to handle model Heterogeneity and to defend against data poisoning attacks in FL.
There are two directions to do future work.
First, we plan to study how to use Fed-EDKD to handle heterogeneous FL, in which the local models submitted
from clients are heterogeneous with different network depths.
Second, we plan to empirically measure the performance of Fed-EDKD in the presence of data poisoning attacks.
