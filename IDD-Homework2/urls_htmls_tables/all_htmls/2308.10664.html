<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">Progressing towards a new era of Artificial Intelligence (AI) - enabled wireless networks, concerns regarding the environmental impact of AI have been raised both in industry and academia. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a key privacy preserving decentralized AI technique. Despite efforts currently being made in FL, its environmental impact is still an open problem. Targeting the minimization of the overall energy consumption of an FL process, we propose the orchestration of computational and communication resources of the involved devices to minimize the total energy required, while guaranteeing a certain performance of the model. To this end, we propose a Soft Actor Critic Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) solution, where a penalty function is introduced during training, penalizing the strategies that violate the constraints of the environment, and contributing towards a safe RL process. A device level synchronization method, along with a computationally cost effective FL environment are proposed, with the goal of further reducing the energy consumption and communication overhead. Evaluation results show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed scheme compared to four state-of-the-art baseline solutions on different network environments and FL architectures, achieving a decrease of up to 94% in the total energy consumption.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The Information and Communication Technology (ICT) industry represents an important energy consumer, utilizing 4% of the world’s
electricity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Progressing from 5G to Beyond 5G (B5G) and 6G networks, it becomes apparent that as the density of the network
infrastructure along with the number of connected devices exponentially increases, so does the energy demand. The ICT industry is expected to reach 10-20% of the world’s
electricity by 2030 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Many ambitious climate change activities are already taking place by the European Commission across the ICT industry, in line with the GSMA’s commitment towards net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In future wireless networks, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a key enabler has been recognized by both industry and academia <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Centralized AI approaches require a vast amount of data transfer to centrally located and energy hungry data centers, raising concerns with regard to both data privacy and energy consumption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Alternative solutions such as Federated Learning (FL) have surfaced, where devices perform a model training in a collaborative manner, exploiting locally stored datasets and avoiding any raw data transmissions. FL could be effectively deployed to numerous use cases and applications, where indicative examples include smart cities, smart transportation and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Towards this direction, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) in Rel. 18, tries to adopt FL in Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, with the introduction of the Model Training Logical Function (MTLF) in Rel. 17 that is responsible of training Machine Learning (ML) models and exposing new training services <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Several critical challenges have been raised related to the application of FL to wireless networks, significantly affecting the overall energy consumption of the involved devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Firstly, the model training process requires constant model update transmissions from the computing devices. Such model updates could consist of complex neural networks comprising millions or even billions of parameters. This implies a significant communication overhead, making the uplink transmissions particularly challenging. On the one hand, from the computing device perspective, transmitting a large volume of model updates periodically, imposes notable energy demands. On the other hand, the communication channel occupancy increases proportionally to the number of computing devices. The smooth operation of an FL process may be significantly impacted, particularly in the case of dynamic network environments with time-varying network conditions (e.g constantly changing channel conditions, fluctuations in traffic congestion). Secondly, ML model architectures require complex calculations, tightly related to the size of the ML model, resulting in even more challenges in terms of the energy aspect, since significant computational work will take place on device level during training. Another critical challenge of major importance includes computation and data heterogeneity across devices, in conjunction with strict ML model performance requirements. More specifically, critical services and applications often require stringent ML model performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, which is directly translated to higher training times and as a result to an increase in the overall energy consumption. Such deterioration could be accelerated in case of devices differing in both available resources and statistical data distribution.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Taking into consideration the aforementioned challenges, it becomes apparent that new solutions are required to mitigate the environmental impact of FL in dynamic wireless communication networks, while guarantying a certain ML model performance. This could be achieved through the reduction of the energy consumption required to complete all the FL-related tasks. A number of state-of-the-art works focus on energy efficiency, by examining the problem in terms of resource orchestration, computation offloading or load balancing strategies (e.g. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>). However, only a limited number propose resource orchestration in run time (e.g. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>) and to the best of our knowledge only one work considers the complexity of an FL model architecture <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. In addition, none of the existing works propose a safe learning approach that will enhance the decision making by selecting strategies that respect the constraints of the environment. In parallel, there are no solutions considering the potentially prohibited energy cost that is required, while exploring for optimal resource orchestration strategies towards energy efficient FL processes.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The current work targets the minimization of the overall energy consumption of an FL process in a wireless communication network, by orchestrating the computational and communication resources of the involved devices, while guaranteeing a certain FL model performance target. The FL model transmissions are taking place in a synchronized manner towards eliminating the effect of straggling devices. This synchronization is realized at the device level, so as to avoid unnecessary FL model transmissions due to time overdue, and as a result, contribute not only to the reduction of the overall energy consumption but also to the overall communication channel occupancy. Finally, in dynamic wireless communication networks, the heterogeneity characterizing both the devices and the data varies over time, hence up-to-date decisions should be made in a run-time manner.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In order to achieve a run-time decision making, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) solution, utilizing the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. SAC is known to achieve efficient learning, stability and robustness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. A SAC agent is trained under different conditions of the environment in an offline phase, in order to produce a robust model that is used in a run-time inference phase, orchestrating the computational and communication resources of the devices that are involved in an FL process.

The work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> targets to optimize the performance of an FL model, using multi-agent RL, while considering energy-related requirements.

<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">It must be noted that only a limited amount of the state-of-the-art works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> propose solutions that can be deployed in a run-time manner, taking into account the dynamicity of wireless network environments. Also, only the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> take into account the FL model’s complexity in conjunction with its size that could significantly affect the total energy consumption of the system. Moreover, there are no related works incorporating the wasted amount of consumed energy for any unfinished FL task (e.g. due to time limit) as part of the solution. Also, none of the existing RL works consider the energy cost that is required, while exploring for energy efficient strategies. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first work that addresses the minimization of the overall FL related energy consumption and communication channel occupancy in a run-time and safe <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> manner, tailored to any time-varying wireless network environment, while taking into account the FL model’s performance and complexity. Finally, this work towards addressing the energy cost of the offline RL phase, proposes a computationally cost effective FL environment that emulates a real FL process.

<p id="S5.p13.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the fast convergence of the SAC agent, the training procedure may require up to millions of episodes until convergence in dynamic environments. As it becomes apparent, the training process of the SAC agent, incorporating periodical executions of FL processes, is of high complexity and time consuming, but most importantly, contrary to the objective of the current work; it requires a significant amount of energy consumption. In order to overcome this issue and as it will be described in Section <a href="#S6" title="VI Simulation Setup ‣ A Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Energy Efficient Federated Learning in Wireless Communication Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VI</span></a>, a significantly simpler FL environment was designed for the SAC training phase, emulating a real FL process for a given performance target. This is accomplished through the estimation of the necessary information that is related to the energy consumption of the system, i.e the number of <span id="S5.p13.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">local</span> iterations and the global performance rate achieved at each <span id="S5.p13.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">global</span> iteration. Through this simulated environment, the SAC agent can be efficiently trained, for a high number of episodes with different configurations, towards providing near optimal solutions. Finally, in the online inference phase and in order to evaluate the effectiveness and the robustness of the SAC agent, the trained SAC model is tested using real FL processes.</p>

The hyperparameters <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> of the SAC DRL algorithm have been tuned, based on experimentation and are summarized in Table <a href="#S6.T4" title="TABLE IV ‣ VI-C Soft Actor Critic Setup ‣ VI Simulation Setup ‣ A Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Energy Efficient Federated Learning in Wireless Communication Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>. More specifically, the SAC architecture comprises one Policy, two Value and three Target Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Networks, and optimizes a stochastic policy. The same MLP architecture is used for all six networks of SAC, consisting of 2 hidden layers of 256 neurons in the case of 5 and 10 workers and 3 hidden layers of 512 neurons in the case of 20 workers. The optimizer selected for the training phase of SAC is the Adam with initial value of <span id="S6.SS3.p1.3.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">lr</span> set to 0.001 (same for all networks) and the batch size is set to 256. A step decay scheduler is used to reduce the learning rate (<span id="S6.SS3.p1.3.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">lr</span>) every 6000 RL episodes by 1%. The entropy regularization coefficient that controls the exploration/exploitation trade-off of the SAC agent is set to 0.8 and it is automatically reconfigured (’auto_0.8’) by the Stable-Baselines3 framework. The SAC agent uses State Dependent Exploration (SDE), with sample frequency equal to 100 RL steps. All SAC networks are trained every 1000 RL steps and the training starts after the first 100 RL steps, in order to fill the replay buffer of size <math id="S6.SS3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="2\cdot 10^{6}" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS3.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S6.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S6.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S6.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">2</mn><mo lspace="0.222em" rspace="0.222em" id="S6.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S6.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">⋅</mo><msup id="S6.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S6.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml"><mn id="S6.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2" xref="S6.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml">10</mn><mn id="S6.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3" xref="S6.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml">6</mn></msup></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS3.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S6.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1"><ci id="S6.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1">⋅</ci><cn type="integer" id="S6.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">2</cn><apply id="S6.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S6.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">superscript</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S6.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2">10</cn><cn type="integer" id="S6.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3">6</cn></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS3.p1.1.m1.1c">2\cdot 10^{6}</annotation></semantics></math> with enough samples.

For visual clarity all produced results are averaged every 2500 RL episodes. Fig. <a href="#S6.F1.sf1" title="In Figure 1 ‣ VI-C Soft Actor Critic Setup ‣ VI Simulation Setup ‣ A Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Energy Efficient Federated Learning in Wireless Communication Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1(a)</span></a> depicts the average total energy consumption of the FL system, that is the sum of the total computation (Fig. <a href="#S6.F1.sf2" title="In Figure 1 ‣ VI-C Soft Actor Critic Setup ‣ VI Simulation Setup ‣ A Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Energy Efficient Federated Learning in Wireless Communication Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1(b)</span></a>) and transmission energies (Fig. <a href="#S6.F1.sf3" title="In Figure 1 ‣ VI-C Soft Actor Critic Setup ‣ VI Simulation Setup ‣ A Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Energy Efficient Federated Learning in Wireless Communication Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1(c)</span></a>). As it can be inferred from Fig. (<a href="#S6.F1.sf1" title="In Figure 1 ‣ VI-C Soft Actor Critic Setup ‣ VI Simulation Setup ‣ A Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Energy Efficient Federated Learning in Wireless Communication Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1(a)</span></a> - <a href="#S6.F1.sf3" title="In Figure 1 ‣ VI-C Soft Actor Critic Setup ‣ VI Simulation Setup ‣ A Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Energy Efficient Federated Learning in Wireless Communication Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1(c)</span></a>), the amount of consumed energy, for the different number of workers, significantly decreases with the number of RL episodes. More specifically, the SAC agent converges to a stable solution with low energy consumption, achieving an overall reduction up to 84.6%, 84.5% and 79% in the case of 5, 10, and 20 workers, respectively. As the number of workers increases, so does the time (in RL episodes) the SAC agent requires to converge. This relies on the fact that the state and action space of the environment increases proportionally to the number of workers, and as a result, the SAC agent requires more exploration time.
The duration of the SAC agent’s high exploration phase lasts approximately 0.9, 2.1 and 3.2 million episodes, in the case of 5, 10 and 20 workers, respectively.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In addition, it is intuitive that the higher the number of workers, the higher the total energy consumption of the system. As a result, the average reward that the SAC agent retrieves from the environment is lower for higher number of workers (Fig. <a href="#S6.F1.sf6" title="In Figure 1 ‣ VI-C Soft Actor Critic Setup ‣ VI Simulation Setup ‣ A Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Energy Efficient Federated Learning in Wireless Communication Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1(f)</span></a>). However, as it is depicted in Fig. <a href="#S6.F1.sf4" title="In Figure 1 ‣ VI-C Soft Actor Critic Setup ‣ VI Simulation Setup ‣ A Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Energy Efficient Federated Learning in Wireless Communication Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1(d)</span></a>, the SAC agent achieves an average amount of total energy consumption per worker approximately equal to 11 Joules, in all three cases. This behavior showcases the scalability of our solution, since the increase in the total amount of energy consumption is mainly based on the number of workers. In addition, the slight variations are explained by the fact that the number of <span id="S7.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">global</span> iterations increases with the number of workers. More specifically, the average number of <span id="S7.SS1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">global</span> iterations in the case of 5, 10 and 20 workers is equal to 15, 17 and 19 with a standard deviation of 4, 2 and 2, respectively. This increase in the number of <span id="S7.SS1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">global</span> iterations is experienced due to the non-IID dataset that can affect the convergence speed of the FL process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S7.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">As already stated, the current work introduced a penalty function towards a safe RL process. Based on this, Fig. <a href="#S6.F1.sf5" title="In Figure 1 ‣ VI-C Soft Actor Critic Setup ‣ VI Simulation Setup ‣ A Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Energy Efficient Federated Learning in Wireless Communication Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1(e)</span></a> depicts the average number of constraint violations per worker in an FL process. This figure validates our claims towards a better decision making for the SAC agent, since the total number of constraint violations of each worker during an FL process is almost minimized, achieving on average 0.79, 0.85 and 0.92 violations per worker in the case of 5, 10 and 20 workers, respectively.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.SS1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To summarize, during the offline training phase, the SAC agent showcases a scalable performance in a dynamic training environment, retaining a similar energy consumption per worker for all three cases equal to 11 Joules. Finally, the proposed safe DRL approach highly contributes to an almost violations-free FL process, resulting on average in 0.85 constraint violations per worker for all three cases.</p>

Similarly, for the case of 10 and 20 workers, our solution results in a similar percentage decrease of [94, 86, 78] % and [93, 83, 75] %, respectively. Our approach is capable of improving upon the already energy efficient performance of our GAS approach, achieving a notable decrease in the overall energy consumption of [18, 32, 28] %. Finally, it should be noted that compared to the BES, which is the fastest option in terms of FL execution, our solution achieves on average 17.2 times lower energy consumption for the different number of workers. However, the trade-off for achieving such considerable reduction, is a slower convergence speed. As it appears in the total training time for all <span id="S7.SS2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">global</span> iterations of the FL process, our solution is on average 3.42 times slower compared to the BES for all different workers.</p>

Intuitively, as the dynamicity of the network increases, so does the complexity towards an optimal strategy. However, our solution once again showcases a robust performance by achieving a significant reduction in the total energy consumption up to 94% compared to the four baselines, as in the case of static environment. Once again, our SAC-based solution builds upon the already energy efficient GAS approach, proving to be 34% more energy efficient. Finally, the trade-off discussed in the static environment between FL convergence speed and energy consumption remains, where our solution is on average 2.16 times slower, while consuming 15.72 times lower energy, for the different number of workers.</p>

However, to evaluate the robustness of our solution not only on different network conditions but also on different FL architectures, we use the more complex and unknown (to SAC) CIFAR-10 FL-CNN on the most challenging scenario, i.e. the dynamic network environment with 20 workers. Quantitative results of Table <a href="#S7.T7" title="TABLE VII ‣ VII-B Online Inference Phase ‣ VII Performance Evaluation ‣ A Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Energy Efficient Federated Learning in Wireless Communication Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VII</span></a> show once again that our solution manages to significantly reduce the total amount of consumed energy compared to the four baselines. It should be noted that since the CIFAR-10 FL-CNN is a much more complex architecture, the amount of consumed energy is expressed in kJ. More specifically, our solution achieves a decrease equal to [45, 92, 77, 74] % compared to the GAS, BES, RSS and GSS, respectively. Remarkably, the performance of our solution on a challenging and unknown evaluation scenario, validates our claims towards a robust and generalized SAC DRL approach.</p>

<p id="S7.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The last set of evaluation results refers to our proposed worker side synchronization method compared to the traditional one that takes place at the coordinator side <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>. The primary difference between the two approaches relies on the responsibility for discarding any late model updates. Contrary to our method, in the coordinator side synchronization, the coordinator is in charge of discarding any late model updates.
It should be noted that all results were extracted using the MNIST FL-CNN in the case of 20 workers in the dynamic network environment. Table <a href="#S7.T8" title="TABLE VIII ‣ VII-C Worker Side Synchronization ‣ VII Performance Evaluation ‣ A Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Energy Efficient Federated Learning in Wireless Communication Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VIII</span></a> summarizes the gains of our proposed method for different time thresholds, in terms of:

Intuitively the stricter the time threshold the higher the amount of wasted energy, as a higher number of workers are unable to complete their FL tasks. In our synchronization method both the unnecessary channel accesses and channel occupation time are eliminated. Focusing on the coordinator synchronization, more unnecessary channel accesses lead to higher channel occupancy time. Especially in the case of <math id="S7.SS3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathsf{H}" display="inline"><semantics id="S7.SS3.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S7.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S7.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">𝖧</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S7.SS3.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S7.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝖧</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S7.SS3.p1.1.m1.1c">\mathsf{H}</annotation></semantics></math> equal to 6 seconds, the involved workers are accessing the channel 53.5 times occupying it for 43.3 seconds on average, wasting communication resources. Once again, this highlights the merits of our synchronization method.</p>

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper proves the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed safe DRL solution, targeting the minimization of
the overall energy consumption of an FL process in a wireless
communication network. A simulated
and significantly simpler FL environment was designed for
the SAC training phase, emulating a real FL process, targeting a lower complexity and faster convergence.
The decision making of the SAC agent advances, through the introduction of a penalty function that almost minimizes the number of constraint violations, as it can be deduced from the evaluation section. Evaluation results include 100 real FL independent runs, under different network environments (static and dynamic), and different FL architectures (MNIST and CIFAR-10 FL-CNNs). For the offline phase, our solution achieves an energy consumption decrease of up to 82.7%. For the online phase, comparisons are performed against four state-of-the-art baselines, where our solution achieves a decrease of up to 94% in the total energy consumption. Evaluation results on a challenging and unknown scenario are also included, validating our claims towards a robust and generalized SAC DRL approach. Finally, we propose a worker side synchronization that compared to the traditional one, eliminates the unnecessary channel accesses and total channel occupancy time.
The future work includes an investigation for an energy efficient FL approach, considering also renewable energy sources, towards green communications. Additional types of resources related to the overall energy consumption will be also examined, in order to further improve the carbon footprint of FL in wireless communication networks.</p>
