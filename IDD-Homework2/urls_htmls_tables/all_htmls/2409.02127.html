<h6 class="ltx_title ltx_title_abstract">Abstract</h6>
<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) represents a paradigm shift in machine learning, allowing collaborative model training while keeping data localized. This approach is particularly pertinent in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) context, where data privacy, security, and efficient utilization of distributed resources are paramount. The essence of FL in IIoT lies in its ability to learn from diverse, distributed data sources without requiring central data storage, thus enhancing privacy and reducing communication overheads. However, despite its potential, several challenges impede the widespread adoption of FL in IIoT, notably in ensuring interpretability and robustness. This article focuses on enabling trustworthy FL in IIoT by bridging the gap between interpretability and robustness, which is crucial for enhancing trust, improving decision-making, and ensuring compliance with regulations. Moreover, the design strategies summarized in this article ensure that FL systems in IIoT are transparent and reliable, vital in industrial settings where decisions have significant safety and economic impacts. The case studies in the IIoT environment driven by trustworthy FL models are provided, wherein the practical insights of trustworthy communications between IIoT systems and their end users are highlighted.</p>

</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as one of the promising platforms in collaboration with Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially when applied to Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. With the core elements of FL, it can be applied to intelligent IIoT systems by facilitating AI training at the network edge. Incorporating FL into IIoT networks makes it possible to address scalability issues while also addressing concerns related to user privacy and the confidentiality of industrial data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The integration of FL across diverse industries such as smart cities, healthcare, and transportation is revolutionizing data-sharing methods, attack detection, and privacy preservation. These industries, closely linked with various Internet of Things (IoT) services, benefit from FL’s ability to manage data efficiently and securely, as highlighted in Nguyen’s study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Particularly in IIoT network scenarios, which demand high throughput, low latency, and precise anomaly detection, FL’s role becomes even more crucial. By incorporating deep reinforcement learning within an FL framework, FL-based anomaly detection techniques significantly reduce privacy risks, a concept validated in Wang’s research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, the challenge lies in integrating FL, IIoT, and trustworthiness on a single platform, especially within the IIoT context, which is a relatively unexplored area. The challenge is especially due to the tiny footprint of the IIoT devices to withhold the FL model, and subsequently ensure security and privacy for the devices and model. Addressing this, the chameleon hash method with a configurable trapdoor, as proposed in Wei’s study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, tackles vulnerabilities by employing FL for privacy-preserving data analysis in IIoT. This method has been effectively implemented in a redactable medical blockchain, demonstrating enhanced accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, Li’s research introduces a multi-tentacle federated learning (MTFL) architecture for the software-defined IIoT framework, comprising a stochastic tentacle data exchanging (STDE) protocol and an efficient poisoning attack detection algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. These innovations collectively mark significant advancements in the field.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, federated cybersecurity, a decentralized approach through FL, plays a pivotal role in identifying and mitigating security threats in the IIoT, as discussed in Ghimire’s study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. FederatedTrust, for instance, ensures reliable FL models by employing thirty metrics and six pillars to evaluate trustworthiness in IoT and edge computing, as noted by Sanchez <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. This underscores its practical application in IoT security, particularly in smart industries. Despite these developments, the existing literature on trustworthy FL, especially in IIoT, remains limited, lacking a forward-looking vision for the potential, enabling technologies, challenges, and various design aspects of employing FL in IIoT networks.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To strengthen the model’s robustness against possible attacks, “adversarial training” entails supplementing training data with adversarial instances that are designed to trick the model. Adversarial training strengthens FL models against malevolent actors trying to impact model integrity in the setting of IIoT, where security risks are common. On the other hand, the term “byzantine-resistant aggregation” describes methods used in the FL process to reduce the impact of attacks. Byzantine-resistant aggregation guarantees that malicious nodes do not disrupt the collaborative learning process in IIoT settings, where data integrity is crucial. This improves the dependability and credibility of FL models used in IIoT contexts. These methods are essential for preserving FL models’ integrity in the face of possible hostile impacts and protecting IIoT systems’ efficacy and security.</p>
