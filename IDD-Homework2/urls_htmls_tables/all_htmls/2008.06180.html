<p id="id6.id1" class="ltx_p">This study develops a federated learning (FL) framework
overcoming largely incremental communication costs due to model sizes in typical frameworks without compromising model performance.
To this end, based on the idea of leveraging an unlabeled open dataset,
we propose a distillation-based semi-supervised FL (DS-FL) algorithm that exchanges the outputs of local models among mobile devices,
instead of the model parameter exchange employed by typical frameworks.
In the proposed DS-FL, the communication cost relies only on the output dimensions of the models and does not scale up according to the model size.
The exchanged model outputs are used to label each sample of the open dataset, creating an additionally labeled dataset.
The newly labeled dataset is used for further training the local models,
and model performance is enhanced owing to the data augmentation effect.
We further highlight that in the proposed DS-FL,
the heterogeneity of the devices’ dataset leads to the ambiguity of each data sample, lowering the training convergence.
To prevent this, we propose entropy reduction averaging, where the aggregated model outputs are intentionally sharpened.
Moreover, the extensive experiments conducted show that DS-FL reduces the communication costs up to 99% relative to those of the FL benchmark while achieving similar or higher classification accuracy.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> is an emerging machine learning (ML) framework to perform data-driven analysis or decision making, leveraging privacy-sensitive data from mobile devices.
Typically, in FL, mobile devices collaboratively train their local ML model through the periodical exchange and aggregation of ML model parameters or gradients at central servers rather than exchanging their raw data.
Thus, FL differs from typical ML in which raw data is acquired and stored in central servers where the private data of the mobile users can be exposed.
Owing to the privacy advantage, FL can be applied to model training tasks with privacy-sensitive data.
For example, Google-keyboard query suggestions from the typing history of mobile users, containing privacy-sensitive information such as the credit card information of the user or login credentials <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the benefits of FL, relying on distributed mobile devices generally poses new inconveniences related to communication efficiency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
Specifically, the periodical model parameter exchange in typical FL entails communication overhead that scales up according to the model size.
This prohibits the use of large-sized models, particularly when the mobile devices are connected to wireless networks while competing for limited radio resources, which can be a crucial bottleneck for building practical ML models.
Hence, an FL framework that can be scalable according to the size of the models in terms of communication efficiency is required.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Motivated by the inconvenience mentioned above, we aim to answer the following question:
<span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">
How should an FL framework be designed scalable according to the model sizes in terms of communication efficiency while achieving model performance comparable to that of the benchmark FL designed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>?
</span>
Concisely, our answer is leveraging an unlabeled open data shared among the clients to enhance the model performance of model output exchange methods.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To achieve the scalability of the communication overhead,
we leverage the principle of FL with <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">model output exchange</span> instead of model parameter exchange.
Here, the exchanged model outputs of mobile devices are named “local logit” instead of model parameters.
The local logits are ensembled in a central server into a “global logit” that is regarded as <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">teacher</span> knowledge.
Moreover, this knowledge is transferred into local models as <span id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">students</span>.
In the model output exchange, communication overheads depend only on the model output dimension, which is often substantially smaller than the number of model parameters and cannot scale up regarding model sizes.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Hence, answering the above question boils down to designing an FL framework with model output exchange to achieve similar performance to the benchmark FL designed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
Although the FL with model output exchange is available in the literature, this task remains nontrivial because of the several challenges we describe below.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Leveraging unlabeled data towards performance similar to that of benchmark federated learning under non-IID.</span> Typical FL with model output exchange termed federated distillation (FD)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> can achieve scalability of the model size; however, these methods provide poor models in general.
In FD, each mobile device re-trains local model based on both the local labeled data and the global logits.
However, under non-IID data distribution, where the local dataset of the mobile user does not represent the population distribution, the global logit retains similar information to the local labels already attached to each mobile device.
Hence, this re-training can be almost identical to local model training.
(see “1. Update” and “6. Distillation” procedures in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1.2 Related Work and Paper Organization ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Distillation-Based Semi-Supervised Federated Learning for Communication-Efficient Collaborative Training with Non-IID Private Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> (b) in Section <a href="#S2" title="2 Distillation-Based Semi-Supervised Federated Learning Method ‣ Distillation-Based Semi-Supervised Federated Learning for Communication-Efficient Collaborative Training with Non-IID Private Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> for detail).
Thus, the model performance trained in FD is worse than that in an FL benchmark exchanging model parameters <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
Moreover, achieving similar performance to the FL benchmark is challenging.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Our key idea is to share the unlabeled open data among mobile devices and leverage the data for distillation to overcome this challenge.
In this regard, we propose a novel FL framework-exchanging model outputs named distillation-based semi-supervised FL (DS-FL).
Unlike FD, in the proposed DS-FL, teacher knowledge is used to label the unlabeled data instead of local data already labeled.
The procedure creates novel labeled data.
Subsequently, through the re-training of the local models based on the dataset, the model performance is enhanced due to data augmentation effects (see “6. Distillation” procedure in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1.2 Related Work and Paper Organization ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Distillation-Based Semi-Supervised Federated Learning for Communication-Efficient Collaborative Training with Non-IID Private Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> (c) in Section <a href="#S2" title="2 Distillation-Based Semi-Supervised Federated Learning Method ‣ Distillation-Based Semi-Supervised Federated Learning for Communication-Efficient Collaborative Training with Non-IID Private Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> for detail).
The ML experiments show that the proposed DS-FL achieves similar or higher performance compared to that of the FL benchmark with model parameter exchange while reducing communication overheads. To the authors’ best knowledge, our approach has not been considered before.</p>

However, owing to non-IID data distributions, each uploaded logit exhibits heterogeneity.
Moreover, the aggregated global logit may represent <span id="S1.p8.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ambiguous knowledge</span> where the global logit exhibits a high entropy.
Thus, indicating that the global logit provides incorrect knowledge regarding which class each sample of the unlabeled data pertains, resulting in slower convergence of model training.</p>

<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">Motivated by the challenge mentioned above, we propose entropy reduction aggregation (ERA) that intentionally reduces the global logit entropy.

<p id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Based on the fundamental idea of leveraging unlabeled open data, we propose an FL framework named DS-FL, which is communication-efficient and achieves a high model performance.
In more detail, DS-FL exhibits a model performance similar to that of an FL benchmark even under non-IID data distributions while achieving scalability according to model size in terms of communication efficiency.
With the exchanged model outputs, the unlabeled data acquire labels, based on which each local model can be further trained.
Therefore, model performance is enhanced due to the data augmentation effects.
Moreover, DS-FL exchanges model outputs instead of model parameters, where the communication overhead cannot scale up according to the model size.

First, we highlight that the heterogeneity of the uploaded model output leads to higher entropy of the aggregated model outputs, which is the principal cause of the challenging slower convergence.
Hence, the key idea behind introducing ERA is to reduce the entropy of the global logit intentionally before distributing it into mobile devices.
The ML experiments verify that ERA achieves faster convergence than a baseline considering simple averaging (SA) aggregation, thus, reducing the cumulative communication cost by up to 75%.</p>

However, the study relies on a different motivation; it is based on enhancing attack robustness from malicious mobile devices.
Our initial study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> was presented at a domestic conference in parallel to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.

For example, the initial study that proposed FL addressed this problem by increasing the number of local model updates and exchanging the model parameters less frequently <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
In this approach, network traffic reduces drastically compared to that of algorithms considering iterating local model update and model parameter exchange alternately<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
An alternative strategy is to limit the number of participating mobile users by selecting the users satisfying the stringent requirement for model update time<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. The network traffic can be reduced relative to all users participating in the FL.
Other approaches generating an additional labeled dataset,
distributed and used on the clients, are <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
Indeed, these approaches improve communication efficiency and model performance.
Another stream of research proposed the model compression to reduce the communication cost required for the model parameter exchanges, which can be performed via several strategies, such as low-rank representation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, model parameter quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, neural network pruning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, update reuse <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, parameter sparsification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, and the Chinese remainder theorem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.
However, these studies relied on the model parameter exchange, where the communication-overhead increases proportionally to the model size.
Unlike these studies, we aim to design an FL framework scalable for model size in terms of communication efficiency by designing an FL framework exchanging model outputs instead of the entire model parameters.</p>

In CD, distributed ML models are trained over a shared labeled dataset.
Subsequently, each local logit from the trained distributed ML models is exchanged and aggregated into global logit acting as teacher knowledge.
Finally, the teacher knowledge is transferred into each distributed ML model acting as a student by re-training the ML model using the global logit.
Note that this framework is an extension of the knowledge distillation presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> for multi-party training.
Another distributed learning method similar to CD, named private aggregation of teacher ensembles (PATE), was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, where the teacher knowledge transfer is performed over the unlabeled dataset instead of the labeled dataset.
While both CD and PATE improve each distributed ML model in a communication-efficient manner, the assumption that each distributed ML model is trained over a shared labeled dataset is suitable for parallel model training in the data center.
However, the assumption is not suitable for model training with data generated on mobile devices.
Unlike these training methods, we design an FL framework with model output exchange, enabling model training with mobile device-generated data subjected to challenging non-IID data distributions, as discussed in the previous section.</p>

Unlike CD and PATE that trains distributed ML models using a shared dataset, each mobile device trains each ML model using a local dataset, enabling ML model training with mobile device-generated data.
While FD performs well when the mobile device-generated data is identically and independently distributed, FD exhibits lower performance than the FL benchmark with model parameter exchange in non-IID data distributions.
This was experimentally verified in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> and the experiments presented in Section <a href="#S4" title="4 Experimental Evaluation ‣ Distillation-Based Semi-Supervised Federated Learning for Communication-Efficient Collaborative Training with Non-IID Private Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>.
To fill this gap, we design an FL framework with model output exchange achieving similar or higher performance than previously proposed approaches even when subjected to non-IID data distributions.</p>

The work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> aimed to improve vertical FL (VFL), which builds a machine learning model based on vertically portioned data (e.g., multiview images).
In this setting, the model parameters or gradients are not generally uploaded, and hence, the communication cost is negligible.
Being different from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, as in the benchmark frameworks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, this study considers horizontal partitioned data and addresses the communication costs for uploading model parameters or gradients.

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the FL with model parameter exchange, mobile users, called <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">clients</span> as per terminology, collaboratively train ML models while exchanging the model parameters, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1.2 Related Work and Paper Organization ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Distillation-Based Semi-Supervised Federated Learning for Communication-Efficient Collaborative Training with Non-IID Private Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> (a).
Specifically, the training procedure in FL with model parameter exchange includes four steps: “1. Update,” “2. Upload,” “3. Aggregation,” and “4. Broadcast.”
These steps follow an iterative process until training converges.
In “1. Update” step, every client trains its local ML model using its own labeled dataset.
The “1. Update” step is common to the DS-FL.
Subsequently, in “2. Upload” step, the clients share the model parameters with a remote server.
Finally, the server aggregates the uploaded model parameters to build the global model in the “3. Aggregation” step and broadcasts the parameters of the global model to the clients in the “4. Broadcast” step.</p>

In the FD, each client treats itself as a student, while aggregated logits act as teachers, where each local client model is trained using the aggregated logits.
The specific procedure in FD consists of the following six steps: “1. Update,” “2. Prediction &amp; Logit aggregation per label,” “3. Upload,” “4. Aggregation,” “5. Broadcast,” and “6. Distillation,” as shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1.2 Related Work and Paper Organization ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Distillation-Based Semi-Supervised Federated Learning for Communication-Efficient Collaborative Training with Non-IID Private Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> (b).
The differences between FD from the benchmark 1 are in the second and sixth steps.
After the “1. Update” step, using the trained local ML model, every client calculates the local logit representing the inferred probability that each data sample is classified into each class.
Subsequently, each local logit is aggregated to each client on a per-label basis in the “2. Prediction &amp; Logit aggregation per label” step.
The aggregated logits are uploaded to a remote server in the “3. Upload” step.
The uploaded logits are aggregated in the server in the “4. Aggregation” step, whereas the aggregated logits are broadcast to the clients in the “5. Broadcast” step.
Finally, in the “6. Distillation” step, each client re-trains its local model using both the pre-attached labels and the broadcasted logits.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p7.5" class="ltx_p">The model performance trained by FD is much lower than FL under non-IID data.
The reason is that the global logits of FD retain similar information to local labels already attached to each mobile device.
The global logit is calculated as the average of the local per-label average logits among the clients.
In the following, we explain the method to obtain global logit in FD more formally.

i.e., class probabilities of class “0,” “1,” and “7” of the global logit for class “1.”
Obviously, the largest probability of the logit is class “1.”
Under strong non-IID data, the probability of class “7” is as large as that of “0” and smaller than that under IID or weak non-IID.
This implies that the global logit under strong non-IID is more similar to one-hot than that of IID or week non-IID.
This may be the reason that the FD model performance is much lower than that of FL under strong non-IID data.</p>

<div id="S2.SS3.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The proposed DS-FL is motivated by the lower performance of the model trained following the FD benchmark presented in the previous section.
In FD, the global logits are used to distinguish the class to which each sample in the local dataset belongs.
However, as the dataset is already labeled, the “6. Distillation” step can result in a similar model to the one trained in the previous “1. Update” step (see Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1.2 Related Work and Paper Organization ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Distillation-Based Semi-Supervised Federated Learning for Communication-Efficient Collaborative Training with Non-IID Private Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> (b) and compare “1. Update” and “6. Distillation”).
Hence, the models trained in FD exhibit similar performance to the local model training, which is lower than the benchmark 1, i.e., FL, with model parameter exchange.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS3.SSS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Hence, the fundamental idea behind the proposed DS-FL is to share the unlabeled dataset and use global logit to identify what class each sample in the unlabeled dataset pertains.
This creates a new labeled dataset, based on which the local ML model is further trained, as shown in “6. Distillation” step in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1.2 Related Work and Paper Organization ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Distillation-Based Semi-Supervised Federated Learning for Communication-Efficient Collaborative Training with Non-IID Private Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> (c).
Due to this training procedure, the proposed DS-FL avoids the similarly in training between “1. Update” and “6. Distillation” steps can enhance the model performance benefitting from data augmentation effects.
In other words, DS-FL uses unlabeled distillation, where a neural network model is trained using other models’ prediction of the unlabeled data.
In the following, we detail the training procedure of the proposed DS-FL.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.2" class="ltx_p">First, we detail our motivation to propose ERA by highlighting that the simple baseline-aggregation-method, involving averaging only the local logits, results in a higher entropy of global logits in the heterogeneity of data distributions among clients than those without such heterogeneity.
Subsequently, we detail how to reduce entropy in ERA.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The motivation for reducing the entropy of global logits is to accelerate and stabilize DS-FL, particularly in non-IID data distributions.
In the collaborative learning with non-IID data, the entropy of global logits is much larger than appropriate ones.
Fig. <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 3.1 Motivation for Entropy Reduction Aggregation ‣ 3 Entropy Reduction Aggregation ‣ Distillation-Based Semi-Supervised Federated Learning for Communication-Efficient Collaborative Training with Non-IID Private Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> shows the comparison of global logits yielded via the simple aggregation method involving the averaging of the uploaded local logits for IID and non-IID data distributions.
Under non-IID data, the entropy in the early stage of training is higher than 2.0, which is approximately the upper limit of the entropy in the ten-class classification problem.
These maximum values of the entropy are meaningless because they do not identify to what class each input sample pertains.
Hence, it is difficult to train using such inappropriately high entropy logit in the simple aggregation method, and hence, the reduction of the entropy is required for training success.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Another favorable consequence of reducing the entropy of global logits is to enhance the robustness against various attacks corrupting local logits and noising open data.
In DS-FL, a malicious client can upload local logits that do not enhance or even harm model performance, which can occur by, for example, updating the local models over the dataset that is not labeled properly.
In addition to such noisy label, open data can be noised; for example, the inadequate data is added to the open data.
In these cases, similarly to under non-IID data distributions, the entropy of global logits yielded from the simple aggregation method averaging local logits becomes higher, leading to poorer model performances.
This fact is verified in Section <a href="#S4" title="4 Experimental Evaluation ‣ Distillation-Based Semi-Supervised Federated Learning for Communication-Efficient Collaborative Training with Non-IID Private Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>.
Hence, reducing the entropy of the global logit is expected to enhance the robustness against such attacks.</p>

Hinton et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> state that in KD, the scores in the logits can be interpreted as an inherent similarity between the corresponding label and the input samples.
For example, one handwritten digit labeled as “7” might provide a score of <math id="S3.SS2.p2.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="0.1" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.p2.3.m3.1a"><mn id="S3.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.cmml">0.1</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.p2.3.m3.1b"><cn type="float" id="S3.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1">0.1</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.p2.3.m3.1c">0.1</annotation></semantics></math> to the label “1” and that of <math id="S3.SS2.p2.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="0.01" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.p2.4.m4.1a"><mn id="S3.SS2.p2.4.m4.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.p2.4.m4.1.1.cmml">0.01</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.p2.4.m4.1b"><cn type="float" id="S3.SS2.p2.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p2.4.m4.1.1">0.01</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.p2.4.m4.1c">0.01</annotation></semantics></math> to the label “4.”
Given that the physical meaning of this score is the probability that each sample pertains to the corresponding label, these scores can be interpreted as how much the given handwritten digit is prone to be “1” and “4.”
As the above bias of this likeliness (0.1 to “1” and 0.01 to “4”) may be yielded due to the similarity between “7” and “1,” the given logit scores are interpreted as the similarity between the corresponding label and the input samples.
To transfer a similar structure,
we trained the student model using the logit create by the softmax function using a high temperature; thus,
emphasizing the non-highest scores.
In contrast, particularly under non-IID data, the global logits of DS-FL is much more ambiguous than the predictions of a well-trained teacher model such as the model used in KD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.
Moreover, the ambiguity may conceal the true classes each sample pertains, wherein the lower temperature is expected to be useful to balance the class information and a similar structure.

For the IMDb dataset, we only considered the top 20k words and the first 200 words of each movie review, following Keras <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> tutorial.
According to the frequency appearance, each word is converted to an integer.
Moreover, following the word order in the sentences, each sentence is converted to a sequence of integers.
For Reuters dataset, we only considered the top 10k words and each word was converted to a integer, as IMDb dataset.
In the sentences categorization task, such as Reuters dataset, the type of words are more useful than the word order.
Thus, we employed the Bag-of-Words method, which is often used as a preprocessing for the Reuters dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>,
i.e., the headline is converted to a binary vector, indicating the sentence composition of words.</p>

For the text classification tasks, we examined two ML models designed for either IMDb or Reuters dataset.
The IMDb dataset is semantic classification, where the word order in the sentences is useful.
Thus, for the IMDb dataset, we employed long short-term memory (LSTM),
which can learn the time-dependent relationships among inputs and outputs.
Specifically, the model for IMDb consisted of a simple LSTM model, which followed Keras <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> tutorial, consisting of a embedding layer (output dimension of each word was 32), a LSTM layer (32 nodes), and a fully-connected layer (2 unit was activated by softmax).
For Reuters dataset, we employed a simple multi-layer perceptron (text-DNN).
Specifically, the model was a three layer perceptron (512 and 128 units activated by ReLU and batch normalized and another 46 units activated by softmax).

We assumed that all clients had the same degree of noisy labeled datasets, i.e., mistakenly labeled private data.
This was regarded as a situation where all clients can be considered as attackers.
Thus, we evaluated DS-FL and FL in a worst-case scenario, which we believed was sufficiently worthwhile to understand the attack robustness in practical and severe situations.

As seen in the tables, the communication costs of the proposed DS-FL and the FD benchmark is smaller than that of the FL benchmark and do not depend on the model sizes.
The reason for this result is that the payload size of the logits uploaded in the DS-FL and the FD benchmark is smaller than that in the ML model parameter used in the FL benchmark and does not depend on the number of model parameters.
Furthermore, the communication cost of the FD benchmark is 100 times smaller than that of DS-FL.
The reason is that the number of logits uploaded by a DS-FL client is more than that of the FD.
In the FD benchmark, the clients upload local logits on a per-classy basis, while in the DS-FL, they upload local logits on a per-sample basis in the unlabeled dataset.
However, the proposed DS-FL exhibits a higher classification accuracy than that of the FD benchmark, which is verified in the following results.</p>

The cumulative communication cost of DS-FL includes an initial cost to distribute the unlabeled data to the clients in addition to the per round cost, while that of other baselines did not include the initial cost.
The initial cost is described as ComU@I in Table <a href="#S4.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ 4.2 Results ‣ 4 Experimental Evaluation ‣ Distillation-Based Semi-Supervised Federated Learning for Communication-Efficient Collaborative Training with Non-IID Private Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>.
In both the FL and DS-FL, as the training processes progress, i.e., the cumulative communication costs to share models or logits increase, and the accuracy improves.
DS-FL performance is evaluated using the global model, which is trained on the server as described in Section 2.3.2.
Meanwhile, the FD accuracy remains approximately <math id="S4.SS2.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="20\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p2.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S4.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">20</mn><mo id="S4.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p2.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S4.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S4.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.2">20</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p2.2.m2.1c">20\%</annotation></semantics></math>, which is almost similar to that of a single client.
In both tasks: MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, the proposed DS-FL outperforms the FL (benchmark 1) in terms of cumulative communication cost while achieving comparable accuracy.
As shown in Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ 4.2 Results ‣ 4 Experimental Evaluation ‣ Distillation-Based Semi-Supervised Federated Learning for Communication-Efficient Collaborative Training with Non-IID Private Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>, the results could be due to the communication cost per round of the DS-FL that is lower than that of FL.
If the aggregation methods in DS-FL are compared, the proposed ERA obtains almost the same accuracy as that of the SA baseline, while the cumulative communication cost to the convergence of ERA is smaller than that of SA due to the acceleration effect of ERA.
Based on these results, we can conclude that the DS-FL with the proposed ERA reduces the communication costs substantially while achieving similar performance to the FL benchmark, i.e., ERA accelerates the convergence speed.</p>

The results show a similar trend to computer vision tasks, i.e., MNIST and Fashion-MNIST tasks.
In both the FL and DS-FL, as the training processes progress, i.e., the cumulative communication costs to share models or logits increases, and the accuracy improves.
In both tasks, IMDb and Reuters, the proposed DS-FL outperforms the FL (benchmark 1) in terms of cumulative communication cost while achieving comparable accuracy. In contrast, the accuracy of FD is much lower than that of FL, i.e., 23.3% and 39.0% lower for IMDb and Reuters, respectively.
If the aggregation methods in DS-FL are compared, the proposed ERA obtains almost the same accuracy as that of the SA baseline, while the cumulative communication cost to the convergence of ERA is smaller than that of SA, due to the acceleration effect of ERA.</p>

In the Fashion-MNIST and Reuters tasks, the Top-Accuracy of the DS-FL with ERA is higher than that of FL for all cases.
In the IMDb task, the Top-Accuracy of the DS-FL with ERA is 4.7% lower than that of FL, whereas it is 18.6% higher than that of FD.
Hence, we can again conclude that DS-FL with ERA achieves similar test performance to the FL benchmark while drastically reducing the communication costs.
Comparing the Top-Accuracy of the proposed ERA and SA baseline, SA achieves higher Top-Accuracy relative to ERA for the MNIST task even though the difference becomes smaller as the number of samples in the unlabeled open dataset increases.
Meanwhile, regarding the Fashion-MNIST task, the proposed ERA achieves higher Top-Accuracy than SA, where the difference ranges from 4.0% to 13.7%.
Hence, recall that Fashion-MNIST is a more complicated task than MNIST <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>.
In the IMDb and Reuters tasks, the proposed ERA achieves higher accuracy than SA.
These results provide insight into the importance of reducing the entropy global logits, particularly in more complicated tasks, to enhance the DS-FL model performance.</p>

However, FD+FAug requires clients to upload a part of their labeled data, which does not satisfy the intentions of comparing FL frameworks under the same clients’ privacy level.
Thus, comparing DS-FL to other approaches that let clients share their raw data, such as FD+FAug and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> is beyond the scope of this study.</p>

Regarding the DS-FL with SA and FL, Fig. <a href="#S4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 4.2 Results ‣ 4 Experimental Evaluation ‣ Distillation-Based Semi-Supervised Federated Learning for Communication-Efficient Collaborative Training with Non-IID Private Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a> shows that as the noised classes increase, the Top-Accuracy decreases.
However, the DS-FL with ERA maintains the Top-Accuracy, when the noised-classes increase.
This indicates that the DS-FL with ERA is more robust to IID noising than the FL.
The following section presents an analysis of the global logit entropy to explain the robustness.</p>

Hence, we can conclude that the proposed ERA is more robust against a noisy open dataset than the SA baseline.
This result is because the proposed ERA alleviates the increase in the entropy of global logits due to the noisy unlabeled data relative to the SA baseline, as shown in the following section.</p>

The objective of the malicious client was to replace the global model with the model achieving high-test accuracy on both the main and the backdoor tasks.
In FL, the global model achieved high-test accuracy on both the main and the backdoor tasks.
This result implies that the objective of the malicious client was achieved.
In contrast, in DS-FL with SA and with ERA, the test accuracy of the global model on the main task was as high as that in FL; however, the accuracy on the backdoor task was much lower than that in FL.
This result implies that the objective of the malicious client was not achieved; thus, the attack failed.
The reason is that DS-FL asks clients to transmit only logit but not ML model parameters,
which prevents the malicious client from the attack that needs altering the uploading model parameters.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We proposed a cooperative learning method, named DS-FL, designed to be scalable according to model sizes in terms of communication efficiency while achieving similar accuracy to benchmarks FL algorithms.
The fundamental idea of the proposed DS-FL was the model output exchange for an unlabeled open dataset.
Additionally, we proposed a logit aggregation method for the DS-FL, which aimed to accelerate the training process and enhance robustness under the non-IID data.
The simulations showed that the proposed DS-FL method outperformed the benchmark method FL in terms of communication cost and robustness while achieving similar or superior accuracy to that of the FL.
Moreover, the experimental results showed that the DS-FL with ER was more communication efficient and robust than the DS-FL with SA.
To explain the performance of the proposed methods, we analyzed the experimental results from the perspective of entropy.
Additionally, the impact of the open dataset volume was evaluated.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The future works will include developing the logit aggregation method, considering the individual device characteristics.
For example, enhancing the impact of the logits uploaded by the reliable or high-performance client with respect to the global logit.
However, how to evaluate the reliability of the clients, and how to control the impact of the uploaded logit are unknown.
Another interesting direction is leveraging the logits had uploaded in the past round.
In this work, the server and the clients used the logits uploaded at the current round.
However, it might be useful to note that the logits had been uploaded in the past rounds.
Moreover, another direction of future work is to design an FL framework performing under non-IID data distributions and unbalanced and massively distributed data while achieving communication costs scalability.
To evaluate the FL framework under unbalanced and massively distributed data, the benchmarking framework for FL, LEAF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, will be helpful.</p>
