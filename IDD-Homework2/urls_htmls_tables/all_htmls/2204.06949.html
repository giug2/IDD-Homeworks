<p id="2.1" class="ltx_p">Deep learning methods have revolutionized mobile robotics, from advanced perception models for an enhanced situational awareness to novel control approaches through reinforcement learning. This paper explores the potential of federated learning for distributed systems of mobile robots enabling collaboration on the Internet of Robotic Things. To demonstrate the effectiveness of such an approach, we deploy wheeled robots in different indoor environments. We analyze the performance of a federated learning approach and compare it to a traditional centralized training process with a priori aggregated data. We show the benefits of collaborative learning across heterogeneous environments and the potential for sim-to-real knowledge transfer. Our results demonstrate significant performance benefits of FL and sim-to-real transfer for vision-based navigation, in addition to the inherent privacy-preserving nature of FL by keeping computation at the edge. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first work to leverage FL for vision-based navigation that also tests results in real-world settings.</p>

Connected robots open a wide variety of opportunities within the Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, specifically as mobile sensor networks capable of intelligent behavior and multi-modal data acquisition.

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The relevance of AI and deep learning (DL) in robotic systems has increased significantly as DL methods enable higher degrees of situational awareness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. For a variety of tasks in robotics, mobile navigation, human-like walking, teaching through demonstration, and collaborative automation, to mention a few examples, DL or machine learning has attained state-of-the-art performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. One of the areas where DL has had more impact is arguably computer vision, which has led us to put the focus on a relevant use-case for autonomous mobile robots: vision-based obstacle avoidance. Moreover, vision-based obstacle avoidance is instrumental not only for robot navigation but could also aid visually handicapped citizens <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Research has shown that DL can boost vision-based obstacle avoidance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> and, especially when combined with specific technologies such as multi-view structure-from-motion, can reach a better degree of precision than other approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this manuscript, we focus on studying a federated learning approach for vision-based obstacle avoidance in distributed IoRT systems. A collective model built from and shared within a team of robots operating in different environments can bring numerous benefits, including more robust performance but more importantly higher readiness levels to operate in new environments or properly react to new situations. Collaborative multi-robot systems can be more efficient and have higher success rates in heterogeneous environments including unknown ones <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning brings multiple benefits to collaborative learning in the IoRT. Compared to cloud-based centralized learning, it allows for optimization of networking resources and the preservation of data privacy by computing model updates directly at the edge. We propose a FL approach that combines data from both simulated and real robotic agents. A conceptual illustration of such system is illustrated in <a href="#S1.F1" title="In I Introduction ‣ Federated Learning for Vision-based Obstacle Avoidance in the Internet of Robotic Things" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">fig.</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. We study the performance of FL over centralized learning in the simulated and real worlds separately, analyze the improvements of merging data from heterogeneous scenarios, and finally the potential for sim-to-real knowledge transfer.</p>

<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Partly owing to the benefits of sharing knowledge without transferring raw data, FL as a privacy-preserving distributed learning has been utilized in multiple domains in robotics and autonomous system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. These domains include, but certainly are not limited to, navigation, cooperative SLAM based on visual-Lidar, trajectory forecasting, human-robot collaborative learning, and robot perception. To the best of our knowledge, however, there is no specific work related to applying FL in robotic vision-based obstacle avoidance in real-world scenarios.</p>

<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In summary, in this work, we explore the potential for FL within hybrid teams of simulated and real robotic agents.
The main contributions of this work are the following. First, the design, implementation, deployment, and evaluation of a vision-based deep-learning approach to obstacle avoidance in mobile robots in heterogeneous simulated and real scenarios. We then evaluate the performance benefits of such an approach over offline learning or learning from more limited data sources. We put an emphasis on the benefits when robots are deployed in heterogeneous environments, showing that collaborative learning improves performance even for robots that do not change their environment. For this work, we deploy robots in highly photorealistic and physically-accurate virtual environments and study the ability of such a setup for sim-to-real transfer.

In a recent relevant study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, the authors demonstrate the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to perform obstacle avoidance via a monocular camera mounted on a UAV with minimal knowledge of the environment. In addition, DRL could perform more effectively even with irregular input by embedding the image’s depth and semantic information. By adding noise to the depth information, the DRL model’s resilience was increased to near-state-of-the-art levels in some unseen virtual and real-world circumstances <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Availability of data is one of the key challenges for the application of DL to robotics. Synthetic data and data from simulated environments have therefore played a key role in numerous studies. However, traditional robotics simulators such as Gazebo, widely used in the development of mobile robots, are incapable of generating realistic visuals. Therefore, while they are efficient for testing autonomy stacks based on other types of sensors such as lidars, which only need accurate geometric data, they are unsuitable for vision-based approaches and limit the sim-to-real knowledge transferability. A number of simulation platforms have emerged in recent years to address this issue. We have listed a relevant set of simulators in <a href="#S2.T1" title="In II-D Photorealistic simulation platforms ‣ II Related Work ‣ Federated Learning for Vision-based Obstacle Avoidance in the Internet of Robotic Things" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">table</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>. Among these, Carla <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> has been widely used in research for self-driving cars, while AirSim <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> has been used in a wide variety of application scenarios. We have chosen for this study, however, the more recent NVIDIA Isaac Sim platform owing to the high-quality visuals but also tools that enable seamless generation of randomized environments for synthetic data acquisition. Randomization and the ability to alter the environments has been shown to be a key parameter to collaborative learning approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. An additional advantage is a common ecosystem of tools with the embedded NVIDIA Jetson platforms, the state-of-the-art in embedded computing for robots that need discrete GPUs for DL inference.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to achieve vision-based obstacle avoidance for the operation of mobile robots, we have chosen to train a generic DL model to assist robots in discriminating between different types of obstacles across heterogeneous environments. This approach comes in contrast to other options, including the detection of individual objects or semantic segmentation (e.g., for segmenting free floor from objects and walls). The selected approach enables us to focus on analyzing the performance of a federated learning approach and the ability for sim-to-real transfer rather than on the design of a specific obstacle avoidance strategy, which is the main objective of this study</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the last part of our experiments, we evaluate the ability of both the centralized and federated learning approaches to transfer knowledge from simulation environments to the real world. To do this, we rely on the same simulation environments but introduce an independent data validation set (<math id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathcal{R}^{*}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><msup id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">ℛ</mi><mo id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">∗</mo></msup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">ℛ</ci><times id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3"></times></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1c">\mathcal{R}^{*}</annotation></semantics></math>) from a navigation mission across different types of indoor spaces. The accuracy for each of the trained models is shown in <a href="#S4.F5" title="In IV-B Sim-to-real performance evaluation ‣ IV Experimental Results ‣ Federated Learning for Vision-based Obstacle Avoidance in the Internet of Robotic Things" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">fig.</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>. We can observe that relatively low performance is achieved with either approach when only one of the simulation environments is used for training the models. This may result from overfitting the model to non-realistic features in the simulated worlds. However, when heterogeneous data is introduced in training, the federated learning approach significantly improves. Our results also show that only when aggregating data from all three simulation environments the centralized learning approach is able to improve the performance to the level of federated learning. The specific reason behind this behaviour requires further study and will be the object of future research.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We have presented a federated learning approach for vision-based obstacle avoidance in mobile robots that leverages data from both simulated agents and real robots with additional sensors. We have shown that interconnected robots relying on deep learning for vision-based navigation can aid each other without sharing raw data. Specifically, we show how training the same model with data from heterogeneous environments improves performance across the simulated and real worlds. More importantly, the performance improvements are better when the models are trained through a federated learning approach compared to centralized learning. In addition to the application-specific improvements, the federated learning approach brings inherent benefits in terms of communication optimization and preservation of data privacy, enabling collaboration across organizations or users. Finally, we have shown that the presented approach is able to transfer knowledge from simulation to reality effectively.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Owing to the potential for sim-to-real transfer and accounting for the better performance of federated over centralized learning, future work will be directed towards lifelong FL through a combination of simulated and real agents. Additionally, we will further explore the reasons behind the differences in performance across the approaches presented in this manuscript.</p>
