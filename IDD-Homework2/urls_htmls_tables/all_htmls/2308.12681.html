<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is an emerging approach for training machine learning models collaboratively while preserving data privacy. The need for privacy protection makes it difficult for FL models to achieve global transparency and explainability.

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">Introduction</h2>

<div id="Sx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kairouz, McMahan et al. <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> is a collaborative training paradigm that jointly trains artificial intelligence (AI) models from a set of FL clients without exposing their local data. Under the guidance of a central server, clients improve their local models from the information gained from other clients. The general idea is that clients upload their model updates rather than data to the FL server. The server aggregates the received models and returns the updated global model to clients so that they can further train it. This privacy-protection joint training schema, however, introduces complexities, particularly in explaining the decision-making process, given the server’s lack of direct access to client datasets.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Explainable AI (XAI) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Gunning et al. <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Xu et al. <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Yu et al. <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite> is gaining attention in recent years. The aim of XAI is to make AI model behaviours interpretable to humans by providing explanations. A wide range of studies have successfully provided explanations for black-box AI models. For instance, approaches like Grad-CAM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Selvaraju et al. <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> analyse the output of the final convolutional layer of a given neural network and calculate how changes to each region of an input image affect the output to identify the most important image regions for decision-making. Model-agnostic algorithms like SHAP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lundberg and Lee <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> and LIME <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ribeiro, Singh, and Guestrin <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite> assess the importance of features at the instance level. However, these approaches cannot clearly illustrate the model decision-making processes, but rather provide a post-hoc analysis of the models.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Concept-based models, as a bridge between symbolic AI (based on rules and logic) and statistical AI (e.g., neural networks), extract concepts from the model by mapping the hidden information of the last layer of neurons in a neural network to human-understandable concepts <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kim et al. <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> or constraining concepts as a part of a neural network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Koh et al. <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. However, the concepts are still isolated and at the instance level. Logic rules, however, can connect the activated concepts during the prediction to illustrate the reasoning process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lee et al. <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. Instance-level logic rules can be further connected to form a global class-level rule <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Barbiero et al. <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. Such logic-based explanations are beneficial as they illustrate the decision-making process in a manner that is readily understood by humans.</p>

<div id="Sx1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Traditional logic-based concept models are designed for centralised AI frameworks and cannot be directly applied in FL settings. Integrating logic rules into FL faces three important challenges:</p>

<div id="Sx2.SSx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx2.SSx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Concept-based XAI focuses on identifying high-level abstractions or “concepts” in data. In traditional deep learning models, the lower layers often detect edges or textures, while the upper layers detect more abstract features like shapes or objects. Concept-based learning regards the abstract features as “concepts” and aims to make them more explicit. The concepts are often obtained by linking the hidden information of the last layer of a neural network to human-understandable concepts <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kim et al. <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Kazhdan et al. <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, or constraining the structure of the neural network to learn the concepts <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Chen, Bei, and Rudin <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Ciravegna et al. <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Koh et al. <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Stammer, Schramowski, and Kersting <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Barbiero et al. <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. The design of a concept-based model makes it suitable to provide explanations for the decision-making process as the concepts are intuitive and understandable for humans, thereby making the decision process transparent. For instance, if a model trained on animal images learns the concept of “wings” and “beaks”, it can explain a classification decision by reasoning that the presence of wings in an image is a strong indicator for the “bird” category.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx2.SSx1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx2.SSx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Logic rules serve as a means to link extracted concepts, enabling the decisions made by the model to be explained based on the concepts it incorporates. Logic rules are inherently straightforward and deterministic. Traditional rule-based systems, such as Decision Trees (DTs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Quinlan <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">1986</a>)</cite>, offer intuitive explanations through logic rules. In DTs, each decision path can be interpreted as a rule. Nonetheless, including all features in a decision path can render a rule excessively lengthy with unnecessary features, and consequently diminish its comprehensibility. In the domain of natural language processing, logical reasoning has been adopted for tasks like sentiment analysis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lee et al. <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> and text prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Jain et al. <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. For image and tabular data, a novel entropy-based linear layer has been introduced to produce rule-based explanations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Barbiero et al. <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. However, these approaches require direct access to the training data, making them unsuitable for operations under FL settings.</p>

<div id="Sx2.SSx2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx2.SSx2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FL offers a decentralised and privacy-preserving approach to training AI models on distributedly owned data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kairouz, McMahan et al. <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. Instead of moving potentially sensitive raw data, only model updates are being sent back and forth between the FL server and the FL clients. However, such a training approach makes it challenging for explaining the decision-making rationale behind the resulting FL model. The FL field has recognised the potential for logic rules to address this challenge. There have been several notable attempts to integrate logic rules into FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx2.SSx2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx2.SSx2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(An and Ma <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>, signal temporal logic is employed to discern the properties of client devices, which are subsequently leveraged to cluster them during model aggregation to produce personalised FL models. Similarly in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Cha et al. <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>, fuzzy logic is used to enhance client selection in vehicular networks. Besides, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhu et al. <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, the Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy rule is integrated into FL for federated fuzzy clustering. Nevertheless, these approaches are predominantly focused on FL client selection and clustering. They are not designed to address the challenges of building explainable FL with logical reasoning. The proposed <span id="Sx2.SSx2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">LR-XFL</span> approach bridges this important gap.</p>

<div id="Sx3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The base model under the proposed <span id="Sx3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">LR-XFL</span> approach is the entropy-based logic explanations of neural networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Barbiero et al. <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. This model adeptly extracts logic-based explanations from neural networks, representing them in logic rules. Designed to handle both images and tabular data, the model provides classification together with rule-based explanations.
For image data, it first employs the ResNet10 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(He et al. <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite> image processing network to map a given image from the pixel space to the concept space. For tabular data, the mapping can be achieved by linear models. Subsequently, the concept space embedding is mapped to the target class using the entropy-based linear layer. The activated concepts are then derived from the parameters of the entropy-based layer to form logic rules.</p>

<p id="Sx4.SSx2.p7.1" class="ltx_p">When either diagonality or exclusivity exceeds a predefined hyperparameter threshold , the connector is designated as OR due to the heightened probability of feature conflicts. Otherwise, it is determined as AND. Both diagonality and exclusivity are computed on the client side based on their sample-based rules. During global rule aggregation, the FL server employs a majority voting mechanism from all client logical connectors to determine the optimal global connector. Note that, in most scenarios, the adopted logical connectors are the same for all FL clients. This consensus arises since the process of determining the logical connectors hinges on potential feature conflicts, which is an intrinsic quality of the features that remains consistent regardless of data distribution. Given that all clients share the same feature space, their assessments concerning potential feature conflicts are likely to align.

After local training, clients share their respective decision trees with the server. The server then evaluates the received local decision trees on a validation dataset to identify the optimal tree. This top-performing local tree is subsequently used as the global decision tree for both predictions and rule generation. As decision trees are not an iterative process, clients are restricted to using the global decision tree without any further optimisation. Decision trees naturally produce rules.

<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsubsection">Model Performance</h4>

<div id="Sx5.SSx4.SSSx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx5.SSx4.SSSx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Under all experiment settings, <span id="Sx5.SSx4.SSSx1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">LR-XFL</span> achieves the highest test accuracy among the federated approaches. Compared to Centralised Learning, which serves as a reference point for non-FL settings with direct access to raw data, <span id="Sx5.SSx4.SSSx1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">LR-XFL</span> often matches or even surpasses its performance. The performance can be attributed to the effectiveness of the <span id="Sx5.SSx4.SSSx1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">LR-XFL</span> automatic logical connector selection method when applied on the client side on local sample-level rules.
Under FL settings, <span id="Sx5.SSx4.SSSx1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">LR-XFL</span>’s advantage over FedAvg-Logic is primarily due to its client weight assignment mechanism. This mechanism effectively identifies clients whose rules make a significant contribution to the global rule set, subsequently granting them increased weights. As a result, the global server relies more heavily on these high-performing clients.
Both <span id="Sx5.SSx4.SSSx1.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">LR-XFL</span> and FedAvg-Logic often outperform DDT. This can be attributed to their capability to leverage insights from multiple FL clients during the training phase. In contrast, DDT selects the local model with the best rule accuracy on the validation set, without integrating local models from other FL clients.
On average, <span id="Sx5.SSx4.SSSx1.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">LR-XFL</span> achieves 1.19% and 3.58% higher model accuracy than FedAvg-Logic and DDT, respectively.</p>

<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsubsection">Rule Generation Performance</h4>

<div id="Sx5.SSx4.SSSx2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx5.SSx4.SSSx2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Rule accuracy and rule fidelity are critical for evaluating the interpretability and trustworthiness of a model. Under FL settings, <span id="Sx5.SSx4.SSSx2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">LR-XFL</span> consistently achieves higher or comparable performance in these respects compared to FedAvg-Logic and DDT. Large differences in rule accuracy between <span id="Sx5.SSx4.SSSx2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">LR-XFL</span> and FedAvg-Logic have been observed under the CUB and V-Dem datasets. This highlights the advantage of the automatic logical connector selection method of <span id="Sx5.SSx4.SSSx2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">LR-XFL</span>. Unlike FedAvg-Logic, which aggregates local rules with the OR logical connector, <span id="Sx5.SSx4.SSSx2.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">LR-XFL</span> determines the most appropriate logical connector for any given scenario. In addition, the performance gain of <span id="Sx5.SSx4.SSSx2.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">LR-XFL</span> over FedAvg-Logic can also be attributed to its rule selection and the client weight assignment mechanisms during FL model aggregation. DDT, given its inherent structure that precludes rule aggregation, occasionally outperforms FedAvg-Logic by avoiding potential issues of indiscriminate rule expansion. On average, <span id="Sx5.SSx4.SSSx2.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">LR-XFL</span> achieves 5.81% and 0.27% higher rule accuracy than FedAvg-Logic and DDT, respectively.</p>

<p id="Sx5.SSx4.SSSx2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The high rule fidelity achieved by <span id="Sx5.SSx4.SSSx2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">LR-XFL</span> highlights the consistency between the rules and the FL model predictions. The rule fidelity is not applicable for DDT since it is inherently rule-based. This metric, which evaluates the alignment between rule-based and model-based predictions, is always 100% for models where rules are direct representations of the model predictions. On average, <span id="Sx5.SSx4.SSSx2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">LR-XFL</span> achieves 5.41% higher rule fidelity than FedAvg-Logic.</p>

<div id="Sx5.SSx4.SSSx3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx5.SSx4.SSSx3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We also conduct experiments to study the robustness of DDT, FedAvg-Logic and <span id="Sx5.SSx4.SSSx3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">LR-XFL</span> against noise in FL clients’ local data, taking the CUB dataset as a benchmark. Figure <a href="#Sx5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ Experiment Settings ‣ Experimental Evaluation ‣ LR-XFL: Logical Reasoning-based Explainable Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> illustrates the experiment results under different noise level settings. It can be observed that as the noise level increases, both model accuracy and rule accuracy decrease for all approaches. However, rule fidelity remains relatively stable, suggesting that the alignment of rules with model predictions is upheld. <span id="Sx5.SSx4.SSSx3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">LR-XFL</span> consistently achieves the highest model accuracy under various noise levels. Moreover, the degradation in its performance is moderate compared to FedAvg-Logic and DDT as the noise levels increase. Notably, the rule accuracy of <span id="Sx5.SSx4.SSSx3.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">LR-XFL</span> remains relatively stable up to a noise level of 60%. This can be attributed to its rule selection and client weight assignment mechanism, which guards the global FL model against integrating information from noisy clients. Interestingly, the DDT model achieves the best performance when the noise level reaches 80%. This can be attributed to its strategy of only adopting the best single client model as the global decision tree, maximally mitigating the exposure to noise at the expense of limiting knowledge sharing among FL clients.</p>

In the experiments, threshold values for diagonality and exclusivity were set to 0.9 and 0.8, respectively, based on hyperparameter tuning. Since the logical connector chosen by <span id="Sx5.SSx5.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">LR-XFL</span> for the CUB dataset is AND, we created an ablated version of <span id="Sx5.SSx5.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">LR-XFL</span> using OR as the logical connector for rules under the CUB dataset.

The results demonstrate that using OR to connect rules can erroneously reduce global rule accuracy when rules may contain complementary information.

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">Conclusions</h2>

<div id="Sx6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed <span id="Sx6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">LR-XFL</span>, a first-of-its-kind logic-based explainable federated learning framework. It is capable of deriving accurate global rules from local rules without requiring access to clients’ local data. The most appropriate logical connectors for aggregating client rules are automatically determined by <span id="Sx6.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">LR-XFL</span> based on the characteristics of clients’ local data. This novel design significantly enhances the trustworthiness of the resulting model. Moreover, the aggregated rules play a pivotal role in determining client weights during FL model aggregation. This transparent design enables domain experts to engage actively in the validation, refinement and adjustment of the rules, thereby helping improve the result FL model as well.</p>

<p id="A1.SSx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In federated learning (FL) settings, the dataset is partitioned to facilitate both server-based and client-based operations. Specifically, 20% of the data is allocated to the server: 10% for the validation of user selection based on their generated rules and the remaining 10% for testing the aggregated global rules and assessing global rule accuracy. For our experiments, we set up 10 FL clients, with each client holding 10% of total client data. Within each client’s data portion, a split of 90% for training, 5% for validation, and 5% for testing is adopted.</p>
