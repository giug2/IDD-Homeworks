<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">We introduce Federated Learning for Relational Data (Fed-RD), a novel privacy-preserving federated learning algorithm specifically developed for financial transaction datasets partitioned vertically and horizontally across parties. Fed-RD strategically employs differential privacy and secure multiparty computation to guarantee the privacy of training data. We provide theoretical analysis of the end-to-end privacy of the training algorithm and present experimental results on realistic synthetic datasets. Our results demonstrate that Fed-RD achieves high model accuracy with minimal degradation as privacy increases, while consistently surpassing benchmark results.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Financial crime poses an increasing threat to global safety and security, both physical and financial. According to UN estimates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, between 80 and 200 billion USD is laundered every year, with these illicit funds being used to facilitate crimes such as illegal arms sales, human trafficking, and terrorism. Further, a recent Nasdaq Verafin report <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> estimates 485.6 billion USD in total losses in 2023 from fraud scams and bank fraud schemes. This immense impact necessitates new technologies that can efficiently and accurately detect and help prevent criminal financial activity.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The vast amounts of data collected on financial customers and transactions provide a rich source of information to construct machine learning (ML) models that can detect anomalous financial transactions connected to criminal activity. Although various machine-learning techniques for financial fraud detection have been explored <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, they rely on centralized methods where all data management and training processes are consolidated into a central hub.
This centralization poses serious threats to the confidentiality of participant data and may lead to potential privacy breaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
Such vulnerabilities can have particularly adverse effects in domains like finance, where maintaining the privacy of various parties is imperative, and financial organizations might be reluctant to share their data due to regulatory constraints and concerns about losing competitive advantage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. These conflicting demands present a challenge in striking a balance between facilitating adequate utilization of ML methodologies for detecting anomalous financial behavior and restricting the leakage of confidential data that could occur through data sharing.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">A promising option is to employ federated learning (FL), a distributed machine learning paradigm where parties jointly train a global model without directly sharing raw data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. In FL algorithms, parties instead exchange intermediate updates, such as model gradients, throughout the training process. However, restricting access to the raw data is not sufficient to protect privacy, and it has been shown that information can be leaked through the intermediate updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
Such leakage could reveal details about individual transactions, account holders, or financial patterns, leading to privacy breaches and regulatory non-compliance.
Furthermore, the majority of FL methods assume that the training data is partitioned in one of two ways: horizontally, where the parties share the same feature space <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, or vertically, where each party has a distinct feature space for the same set of sample IDs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. These assumptions may not hold in complex real-world scenarios, such as financial crime detection. Thus, we need a privacy-preserving FL approach that is targeted specifically for financial transaction data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">We propose Federated Learning for Relational Data (Fed-RD), a privacy-preserving model training algorithm for detecting anomalous
financial transactions.
Fed-RD addresses training data that is partitioned between a <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">transaction party</em> that stores features about individual financial transactions and a set of <em id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">account parties</em>, e.g., banks, that hold information about the accounts involved in these transactions. This data arrangement is novel to FL in that it includes a many-to-many vertical partitioning between the transaction dataset and the account dataset, with one transaction corresponding to a sender and receiver account and one account corresponding to one or more transactions. It also includes horizontal partitioning of the account dataset across banks. To safeguard the privacy of participant data, Fed-RD makes targeted use of differential privacy (DP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> and secure multiparty computation (MPC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> at information leak points in the algorithm. Our approach provides provable privacy protection with minimal degradation of accuracy in the final model.</p>

We refer the reader to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> for MPC protocols that can be applied in FL.

Each party (bank) stores information for a disjoint subset of accounts, such as account identifiers, flags, and addresses.
A one-to-many relationship exists between transactions and accounts, each transaction linking to two accounts, a sender and a receiver. Additionally, there is a one-to-many relationship between accounts and transactions; a single account may participate in multiple transactions, either as a sender or a receiver.
Our system also contains an <em id="S3.SS1.p2.3.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">active party</em> that holds the labels for the training data; a transaction is labeled 1 if it is anomalous and 0 otherwise. If the transaction party holds the labels, it plays the role of the active party.</p>

We propose two variations for the fusion model; in the first, the fusion model accepts a concatenation of the three embeddings, and in the second, it accepts a sum of the three embeddings. We discuss these two approaches and their tradeoffs in the following sections.
We place no restrictions on the types of models; they may be simple, such as linear models, or more complex, such as neural networks.</p>

This noise may adversely affect the accuracy of the training. While Approach 2 requires less noise, this comes at the expense of a less flexible fusion model since embeddings are summed before they are input into the fusion model.

While all versions of the algorithm converge at a similar rate, the AUPRC is lower for the privacy-preserving versions of Fed-RD compared to those that do not provide privacy.
This difference is because DP adds noise, which impacts the model’s accuracy. We further observe that the summation approach slightly outperforms the concatenation approach in this experiment, which is in line with the previous experiments.

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Researchers have widely adopted MPC and DP to protect data or models in FL. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> propose using MPC protocols for VFL but do not integrate DP during training. Therefore, information leakage is still possible from the results of the MPC computations. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> provides a VFL algorithm that guarantees end-to-end privacy through a combination of PBM and MPC. Privacy protection for training data has also been explored in HFL.
For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> combines DP and MPC to protect privacy during the aggregation of party gradients. However, it does not provide end-to-end privacy guarantees. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> utilizes PBM and MPC to protect gradient computations and also proves end-to-end data privacy for HFL training.
It is important to note that although we utilize the same mechanisms as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, there are significant differences in their application and privacy analysis. These works consider data distributions that are either horizontal or vertical, but not both simultaneously, as is the case in our setting. Our unique data partitioning necessitates a novel application of PBM and MPC, as well as new privacy analysis. Recent work proposes TDCD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, an FL algorithm for settings where data is vertically partitioned across parties and then horizontally partitioned within them. This bears some similarity to the Fed-RD setting. However, TDCD does not protect the privacy of training data. Recent works have proposed various solutions to the problem studied in this work. For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> develops a hybrid privacy-preserving framework by partitioning data horizontally and vertically and enhancing privacy by employing MPC and DP. The proposed work is limited to the SWIFT dataset, as it relies solely on the ‘receiver flag’ feature within bank datasets, whereas our approach generalizes to different datasets and different account features.
In addition, the work assumes that either the aggregator or the active party are attackers, but not both, which is not a limitation in Fed-RD.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> also employs a separate bank account model but uses an autoencoder rather than supervised training.
The account model parameters are averaged at the active party, and the average model is shared with the banks. No privacy mechanisms are employed in this step, and information leakage is possible. Similar to Fed-RD, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> uses Gaussian noise to protect account embeddings. However, the work does not provide formal privacy analyses or guarantees for this sharing. In contrast, in Fed-RD, we protect all sites from potential information leaks and provide formal privacy guarantees for end-to-end training.</p>

</h2>

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Fed-RD presents a robust theoretical foundation for privacy-preserving FL in financial crime detection. We provided formal definitions of data privacy within this setting and gave a theoretical analysis of the privacy of end-to-end training. We then presented experimental results demonstrating the tradeoffs among accuracy, privacy, and communication costs.</p>
</div>
<div id="S8.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The practical deployment of Fed-RD necessitates addressing stringent regulatory requirements such as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),
California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), Bank Security Act (BSA), and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws, which mandate compliance while ensuring privacy and security across jurisdictions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. Fed-RD incorporates advanced privacy-preserving techniques, including DP and MPC, and can handle both vertically and horizontally partitioned data for collaborative analysis without direct data sharing, to meet these regulatory standards. To handle real-time data processing, Fed-RD must be capable of efficiently managing and processing continuous streams of transactional data. This involves optimizing the algorithm to support incremental learning and real-time updates without compromising privacy guarantees.
Another important concern is privacy protection for labels.
We will explore such extensions in future work.</p>

Adam demonstrates faster convergence, reaching higher AUPRC values more quickly than SGD. This rapid progression can be attributed to Adam’s momentum components, which help in navigating the parameter space more effectively. In contrast, SGD shows a slower initial increase in performance but demonstrates gradual and consistent improvement. However, it does not surpass the performance of Adam within the span of 200 training epochs.</p>
