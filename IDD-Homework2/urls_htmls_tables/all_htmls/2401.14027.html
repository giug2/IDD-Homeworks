<p id="id17.id1" class="ltx_p">To tackle the scarcity and privacy issues associated with domain-specific datasets, the integration of federated learning in conjunction with fine-tuning has emerged as a practical solution. However, our findings reveal that federated learning has the risk of skewing fine-tuning features and compromising the out-of-distribution robustness of the model. By introducing three robustness indicators and conducting experiments across diverse robust datasets, we elucidate these phenomena by scrutinizing the diversity, transferability, and deviation within the model feature space. To mitigate the negative impact of federated learning on model robustness, we introduce GNP, a <span id="id17.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">G</span>eneral <span id="id17.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">N</span>oisy <span id="id17.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">P</span>rojection-based robust algorithm, ensuring no deterioration of accuracy on the target distribution. Specifically, the key strategy for enhancing model robustness entails the transfer of robustness from the pre-trained model to the fine-tuned model, coupled with adding a small amount of Gaussian noise to augment the representative capacity of the model. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach markedly enhances the robustness across diverse scenarios, encompassing various parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods and confronting different levels of data heterogeneity.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Large language models have garnered considerable attention from both academic and industrial communities, providing artificial intelligence with the capability to adeptly integrate into myriad downstream applications. The deployment of large language models typically involves two discernible phases. As depicted in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ The Risk of Federated Learning to Skew Fine-Tuning Features and Underperform Out-of-Distribution Robustness" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, the initial stage focuses on pre-training the model on an extensive corpus, facilitating the acquisition of broad language knowledge and structures. <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Pre-trained Language Models</span> (PLMs), exemplified by the transformer architecture, have witnessed widespread open-sourcing, with notable instances such as Google’s BERT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Devlin <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>, the T5 model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Raffel <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, and Meta’s LLaMA model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Touvron <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>. Following the pre-training phase, clients engage in fine-tuning the model using domain-specific datasets, thereby enhancing its adaptability to the nuanced data distribution.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, in fields such as network security and healthcare, proprietary domain datasets held by individual clients or enterprises typically demonstrate scarcity and involve privacy-sensitive information. Using the sentence classification task as an example, the volume of the fine-tuning dataset usually ranges from 30k to 400k instances. Consequently, the data held by an individual client is often insufficient to meet the criteria of data quality and quantity required for fine-tuning. To tackle the challenges posed by privacy constraints and data scarcity, recent studies have proposed <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">federated fine-tuning</span>, employing federated learning in the fine-tuning stage. Nevertheless, the impact of federated fine-tuning on the model’s out-of-distribution robustness has not yet been thoroughly investigated. Intuitively, machine learning models must demonstrate generalization to unforeseen data existing in diverse distributions yet pertinent to the same task. This necessity becomes particularly critical in cases where the model robustness of new features and distributions plays a pivotal role in ensuring the reliable deployment of machine learning models with confidence.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Given the robustness requirements and constraints imposed by data scarcity, we contemplate an interesting question: <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Does the federated fine-tuning impact the out-of-distribution robustness of the model?</span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we systematically introduce three robustness indicators—<span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Singular Value Entropy</span> (SVE), <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Largest Singular Value Ratio</span> (LSVR), and <span id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Gradient Deviation Angle</span> (GDA). By monitoring the variations in these three indicators at the classifier layer of the model, we capture insights into the diversity, transferability, and deviation in the model’s feature space. Simultaneously, extensive experiments on different robust datasets are orchestrated. Our experimental results indicate that federated fine-tuning can skew fine-tuning features and underperform the model’s robustness.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Specifically, in federated learning scenarios, two prominent features include data heterogeneity and communication limitations arising from geographically dispersed clients. Taking full fine-tuning as an example, as the heterogeneity of client data increases, the model’s accuracy on in-distribution (ID) datasets exhibits controllable fluctuations. Conversely, the accuracy of the robust dataset decreases relatively swiftly. For instance, with a label distribution shift, the accuracy on the ID dataset increases from 89.6% to 90.8%, while on the robust dataset Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST), it decreases from 72.3% to 60.0%. Moreover, during the fine-tuning phase, a significant exchange of model parameters occurs between clients and servers, often reaching scales of millions or even billions. This underscores the critical need to implement parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods practically. Specifically, these methods involve freezing the majority of parameters and updating only a small fraction of a large model. Representative approaches include BitFit <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Zaken <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, Prefix tuning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Li and Liang (<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, Adapter tuning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Houlsby <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>, and LoRA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Hu <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. However, in our experiments, we observed that when the dataset exhibits a significant degree of heterogeneity, the model’s robustness demonstrates an inverse correlation with the communication efficiency of PEFT methods. For example, Prefix tuning achieves a communication reduction of 12x but achieves only 37.4% accuracy on the robust dataset SST. In contrast, BitFit achieves a communication reduction of 190x with an accuracy of 60.2%. Building upon these findings, there is an urgent need for research to delve into the impact of federated learning on model robustness.</p>

<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To improve model robustness, adaptable to various PEFT methods under increased data heterogeneity, we present GNP, a <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">G</span>eneral <span id="S1.p6.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">N</span>oisy <span id="S1.p6.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">P</span>rojection-based robust algorithm. Our design involves the ingenious creation of a robust vector to transfer robustness from the pre-trained model to the fine-tuned model. Furthermore, we introduce carefully designed quantitative Gaussian noise to enhance the model’s robustness without compromising performance.

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We initially evaluate the OOD robustness of the model by assessing its performance on three robust datasets. As depicted in Figure <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 3.3 Data Heterogeneity can Undermine Model Robustness ‣ 3 Understanding the Impact of Federated Learning on Out-of-distribution Robustness ‣ The Risk of Federated Learning to Skew Fine-Tuning Features and Underperform Out-of-Distribution Robustness" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, on the ID dataset Amazon, the model’s accuracy exhibits a trend of initially increasing and then decreasing with the strengthening of data heterogeneity. Conversely, on the robust datasets Dynasent, SemEval, and SST, the heatmap colors lighten from left to right. This indicates that with increasing data heterogeneity, the model’s accuracy significantly decreases on the robust datasets. In terms of specific numerical values, the model’s accuracy appears relatively stable on the ID dataset. Taking the full fine-tuning method as an example, as the Dirichlet parameter <math id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\alpha" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">α</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝛼</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1c">\alpha</annotation></semantics></math> varies from 10.0 to 0.1, the accuracy on the ID dataset changes from 89.6% to 90.8%. However, on the robust datasets DynaSent, SemEval, and SST, the accuracy decreases from 41.8% to 37.9%, 50.9% to 40.4%, and 72.3% to 60.0%, respectively. The observation of a significant decrease in the model’s accuracy on robust datasets reveals that with enhanced data heterogeneity, the model’s robustness experiences notable deterioration. This phenomenon also indicates a lack of generalization ability across different distributions for the same task. We further conduct feature space analysis to unearth the underlying reason for the loss in robustness.</p>

This indirectly implies that data heterogeneity diminishes the transferability of models. Additionally, GDA oscillates upward with the augmentation of data heterogeneity, indicating a greater deviation between the pre-trained and fine-tuned models. This suggests that as data becomes more diverse, the adjustments specific to the task might deviate more significantly from the initial pre-trained model, potentially affecting performance. Hence, balancing adapting to task-specific data and retaining the robustness acquired during pre-training becomes pivotal.</p>

Our observations reveal that BitFit demonstrates a significantly larger SVE and a smaller LSVR compared to the FT method. This finding suggests that the BitFit method effectively captures more data features and possesses greater transferability. Remarkably, our observations indicate an inverse correlation between SVE values and the scale of trainable parameters within the model. Specifically, the utilization of more communication-efficient fine-tuning methods seems to result in higher SVE values. We posit that this phenomenon is primarily attributed to the reduced number of trainable parameters, enabling the classifier layer to capture information within the data comprehensively. This elucidates the significant disparity in accuracy between Bitfit, exhibiting a communication overhead of 12x, and the Prefix method, which demonstrates a substantially higher communication overhead of 190x.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, in the evaluation of GDA values, the LoRA method demonstrates the highest GDA value, contrasting with the FT method, which exhibits the lowest GDA value. We believe this may be related to the principle of LoRA using a low-rank approximation for fine-tuning. The reduction in matrix rank necessitates a larger GDA in the classifier layer to capture the data features effectively.</p>

This inclusion of Gaussian noise serves two critical purposes: Firstly, it contributes to the augmentation of the SVE, facilitating the incorporation of a more comprehensive data structure across broader dimensions. Secondly, the randomness introduced by the noise can generally enhance the model’s out-of-distribution robustness.

This implies that the GNP-based methods effectively introduce mechanisms capable of reducing the model’s deviation. However, Prefix tuning exhibits a larger fluctuation, correlating with the accuracy performance observed in Table <a href="#S5.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 5.2 Model Accuracy Comparison ‣ 5 Experiment ‣ The Risk of Federated Learning to Skew Fine-Tuning Features and Underperform Out-of-Distribution Robustness" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. We attribute this phenomenon to the decline of SVE values reaching a critical threshold during model training in the context of Prefix tuning methods. Since our approach to enhancing SVE values involves introducing general Gaussian noise, although this facilitates the model to traverse additional dimensions, the efficacy is finite and fails to produce satisfactory results when SVE descends to the threshold. Moreover, the excessive addition of Gaussian noise can also impact the model’s accuracy. Based on the observations above, an explanation is provided for why the introduction of GNP leads to diverse OOD robustness performance across different fine-tuning methods.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we initially disclose that federated learning has the risk of distorting model features and compromising out-of-distribution robustness when fine-tuning. To alleviate the negative impact of data heterogeneity and communication limitations, we propose a General Noise Projection-based robust algorithm, denoted as GNP. Specifically, by incorporating three robustness indicators, robust vectors are meticulously crafted from the fine-tuned model to inherit robustness from the pre-trained model. Subsequently, Gaussian noise is introduced to enhance the model’s representative capacity, thus improving robustness without compromising model performance. Compared with other parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, our approach maintains commendable robustness without sacrificing accuracy in the ID distribution.</p>

This decision is motivated by two primary reasons: firstly, confining computation to the classifier’s weight layer significantly reduces computational costs, supported by research indicating the adequacy of shallow model representations; secondly, the classifier layer, operating as a generic linear layer, enables the consistent computation of robust indicators across the diverse parameter-efficient fine-tuning models.</p>
