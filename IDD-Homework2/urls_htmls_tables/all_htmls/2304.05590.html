<h6 class="ltx_title ltx_title_abstract">Abstract</h6>
<p id="id12.id1" class="ltx_p">Since the concern of privacy leakage extremely discourages user participation in sharing data, federated learning has gradually become a promising technique for both academia and industry for achieving collaborative learning without leaking information about the local data.
Unfortunately, most federated learning solutions cannot efficiently verify the execution of each participant’s local machine learning model and protect the privacy of user data, simultaneously.
In this article, we first propose a Zero-Knowledge Proof-based Federated Learning (ZKP-FL) scheme on blockchain.
It leverages zero-knowledge proof for both the computation of local data and the aggregation of local model parameters, aiming to verify the computation process without requiring the plaintext of the local data.
We further propose a Practical ZKP-FL (PZKP-FL) scheme to support fraction and non-linear operations.
Specifically, we explore a Fraction-Integer mapping function, and use Taylor expansion to efficiently handle non-linear operations while maintaining the accuracy of the federated learning model.
We also analyze the security of PZKP-FL.
Performance analysis demonstrates that the whole running time of the PZKP-FL scheme is approximately less than one minute in parallel execution.</p>

</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been widely used by both academic and industrial communities for many applications ranging from healthcare to commercial products.
For instance, Lampos <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> explored a Machine Learning (ML) model for helping the communication with children with autism.
Esteva <span id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) by using a dataset of clinical images to classify skin cancer.
AI is also a common tool in a variety of industrial products, including face recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> and personalized recommendation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The existing AI learning process can generally be divided into two categories.
One is centralized learning, where all of the training data is managed using a central server. This is the conventional way to train AI models and update model parameters.
The other is decentralized learning, where the training data is distributed among multiple users.
<span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Each user has only parts of the training data as their local data.</span>
In this case, each user firstly trains parameters with local data, and then integrates all of the local parameters into a global one.
Users finally update their local model parameters by the global model parameters and iterate to train with their local data till the model converges.
With the development of edge computing, the computation power of edge nodes extremely has grown significantly in recent years <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.
Consequently, federated learning as advanced collaborative learning has become more widespread <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is aspired by enterprises for multiple reasons.
Laws and regulations related to privacy protection expect enterprises to apply the federated training, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, USA’s California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, and Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) of the People’s Republic of China <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>.
Once users’ local data is leaked due to security vulnerabilities or illegally collected without their permission, then enterprises have to face a huge penalty.
For an instance, Facebook was accused because it scanned faces in the user photo library and offered suggestions about who the person might be without user permission.
Eventually, Facebook paid $650 million to 1.6 million users <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>.
Clearly, given the scale of information systems, massive data can be used for elaborating AI models.
However, data are likely to be from multiple sources and requires multiple enterprises to collaborate.
Since different enterprises have distinct requirements and goals, they might have some conflicts of interest.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Unfortunately, there is still a critical challenge in existing federated learning solutions.
<span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">More concretely, it is difficult to publicly verify all of the local training results without exposing local data.
Since local data are best to not be shared with all the participants for preventing the violation of data privacy, a malicious participant can generate local parameters by providing an appropriate random number rather than training with local data. </span>
Moreover, although local data are possessed by each user only, there are still several attacks based on the local parameters or gradients updated by user participants. For instance, Zhu <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> presented an optimized detection algorithm to obtain both local training input and label from the publicly shared gradients in a few iterations.
Luo <span id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> proposed a set of label inference attacks that achieved an outstanding performance to resist vertical federated learning.
Lam <span id="S1.p4.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> demonstrated that an unreliable central server can perform a dis-aggregate attack to recover the user participant matrix, which enabled traditional gradient inference attacks on users’ personal training data.
<span id="S1.p4.1.5" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Besides, Abadi <span id="S1.p4.1.5.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> attempted to use differential privacy for effectively protecting users’ local data. However, these works did not discussed the public verification for the local training process.</span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">There are existing works aiming at verification in federated learning.
Zhang <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> proposed a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) protocol for verifying the prediction result of a decision tree.
Liu <span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> introduced a ZKP scheme for verifying the prediction result of CNN.
Weng <span id="S1.p5.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> designed a ZKP system to prove the correctness of the training and utilization process.
However, these ZK protocols can only prove to one verifier at a time, and the communication cost is fairly high, when compared with succinct ZKPs like zk-SNARKs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.
More importantly, the aforemnetioned works only supports the verification of the computational process in the use of the model, but not in the training process.
Ruckel <span id="S1.p5.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> investigated a federated learning system, enabling verification of the correctness of the training process.
Nevertheless, their system only supports linear regression that is not a general approach for federated learning algorithms.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Considering the limitations of the existing solutions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>,
<span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">ZKP is intuitively used to achieve public verification and preserve data privacy in the training process for general AI models, simultaneously.
It can transform the training process into the corresponding arithmetic circuit constraints, so the verification can be achieved by proving the circuit satisfiability.</span>
<span id="S1.p6.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">However, it brings a new challenge from the viewpoint of efficiency. </span>
<span id="S1.p6.1.3" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">To the best of our knowledge, most existing zero-knowledge proof schemes are not practical to be directly applied for federated learning with scalable deep learning and machine learning models,
because their computational cost is too heavy, and the privacy of intermediate parameters cannot be sufficiently guaranteed, which pose a privacy threat to the local data of each participant. </span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">To solve all of the aforementioned problems together, in the local parameter generation process, we first separate a complex arithmetic circuit into multiple relatively simple sub-circuits.
This is used to speed-up the verification process by parallel computing. Moreover, if the output of a sub-circuit is directly used as the input of the next sub-circuit, it can violate the privacy of local data.
So, we construct a special ZK proof structure in each sub-circuit, and provide the corresponding ZK proof for the continuity of the input and output between two adjacent sub-circuits.
Furthermore, in the global parameter generation process, noise data are used for perturbing the original data, including the local gradients for deep learning model or local vectors for machine learning model.
Meanwhile, we design a secure sum protocol on blockchain to achieve the public verification of global aggregation.
Besides, a practical FL scheme has to support the operations with float numbers and non-linear functions, because FL is involved in the fractional data types and various complex operations, such as exponential and logarithmic operations.
Consequently, we construct a special mapping algorithm to bridge the gap between float numbers and integers, such that an arbitrary machine learning algorithm can follow the arithmetic circuit constraints. </span></p>

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The concept of federated learning was first introduced by Google <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> in 2016 and has increasingly become popular topic in research.

The original intent of smart contract was to digitize a set of commitments to enable the various participants to follow the committed steps of the protocol. This makes it difficult for the participants to do evil and the protocol can achieve the desired results. The trusted execution and decentralized nature of blockchain for transactions makes smart contracts no longer remain a concept, but actually a program that can run on the blockchain system to execute transactions automatically.</span></p>

The publisher first issues an AI model with initiative parameters.
The trainers run the AI model based on their local data, and they report the local parameters.
The publisher keep aggregating all of the local parameters and starting a new round with the aggregated parameters till the AI model converges.
For the decentralized FL, all of the trainers can negotiate to decide the AI model with the initiative parameters and the aggregation rules at the start.
They can use any decentralized techniques like blockchain to be the communication channel for exchanging the local and aggregated parameters.</span></p>

First, the publisher issues an AI model with initiative parameters as the training task.
Then, all the trainers run the AI model with their local data and generate ZKPs for the training process.
Here, ZKPs are used to convince the publisher that the local model is correctly computed.
<span id="S4.SS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Following by that, the publisher computes the aggregated parameters by executing a secure sum protocol via a well-designed smart contract on blockchain. The secure sum protocol essentially plays the role of the aggregation rule.
And the smart contract guarantees trusted parameter aggregation result. All the above steps are continuously executed till the AI model converges.
The adjustment is considered for protecting local data from being exposed by other trainers and the publisher from analyzing the intermediate parameters, such as the local and aggregated gradients of an artificial neural networks. </span></p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Intuitively, as long as we can convert the training algorithm into an arithmetic circuit, we can generate the ZKP arguing for the correctness of the training process.
However, there could be memory limitations as the typical training algorithm might be too big to be converted into a circuit.
For a simple gradient descent algorithm, consider 90 input samples and iterate through 100 rounds, more than one hundred gigabytes of memory is required for converting the entire computation process into a circuit.
Hence, the trainer has to split the original algorithm into pieces to make the conversion possible and practical.
Then, the trainer can generate several smaller circuits for ZKPs instead of the big ones.
The division of the training algorithm not only decreases the size of the algorithm, but also improves the efficiency, because the conversion is smaller and only needs to be done once.
Besides, all the proofs can be generated in parallel after the training.</p>

<p id="S6.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">While handling the parameters in the ZKP-FL scheme, we observed that the majority of the parameters involved in ML algorithms were fractions.
However, for ZKP, the parameters are merely integers.
Thus, all of the fractions have to be mapped to the integer domain for supporting the execution of cryptographic operations based on elliptic curves.
We use the scaling method described in Algorithm <a href="#alg6" title="Algorithm 6 ‣ 6.1 The Fraction and Integer Mapping ‣ 6 The PZKP-FL Scheme ‣ Zero-Knowledge Proof-based Practical Federated Learning on Blockchain" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> to solve this problem.
Precisely, trainers first reserve a certain decimal place for all fractions in the training process.
The concrete decimal places are decided by the accuracy of the local training.
Each trainer can reserve the appropriate decimal places according to the training process for their local data.
Then, trainers can change the truncated fractions into integers by multiplying with a certain ratio <math id="S6.SS1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="rat" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S6.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S6.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S6.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">r</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S6.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S6.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S6.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S6.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">a</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S6.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1a" xref="S6.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S6.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.4" xref="S6.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.4.cmml">t</mi></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS1.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S6.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1"><times id="S6.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1"></times><ci id="S6.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝑟</ci><ci id="S6.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑎</ci><ci id="S6.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.4.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.4">𝑡</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS1.p1.1.m1.1c">rat</annotation></semantics></math>.

<div id="S6.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS2.p1.2" class="ltx_p">Non-linear operations are common in the federated learning algorithm.
Here, we take the activation function of neural network as an example to demonstrate the proposed scheme can support non-linear operations.
Most of the activation functions have relatively non-linear operations, such as <span id="S6.SS2.p1.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Sigmoid</span>, and <span id="S6.SS2.p1.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">tanh</span> functions, which contain <span id="S6.SS2.p1.2.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">exp(x)</span>, <span id="S6.SS2.p1.2.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">sqrt(x)</span> operations.
Such complex operations are not friendly to the languages describing arithmetic circuits.
We approximate complex operations by linear operations through a Taylor expansion method described in Algorithm <a href="#alg7" title="Algorithm 7 ‣ 6.2 Non-linear Operations ‣ 6 The PZKP-FL Scheme ‣ Zero-Knowledge Proof-based Practical Federated Learning on Blockchain" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a> in the PZKP-FL scheme.
The degree of the expansion is determined by a certain error, which reduces the impact of the approximation on the accuracy with shorter expression.

The computation is carried out by miners according to the given smart contract, and the correctness can be checked by any user available to the blockchain.
So it is negligible that the computation result can be changed, due to the soundness of the smart contract and the consensus mechanism used in the blockchain system.

There are two kinds of participants in this experiment, the publisher and the trainer.
All the evaluations run on an Ubuntu 18.04 instance with 4GiB RAM and Intel Xeon Gold 5128 CPU.
The ZKP toolbox we used is ZoKrates, which can convert codes into arithmetic circuit constraints and generate ZKPs based on inputs.</p>

All of these are sent to each trainer.
As the trainers carry out the training process with the integer algorithm and preserve all the intermediate data, they can generate the ZKP by using the algorithms described in Section <a href="#S5" title="5 The ZKP-FL Scheme ‣ Zero-Knowledge Proof-based Practical Federated Learning on Blockchain" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>.
Once the training is completed, the trainer sends all the proofs with the local model to the publisher.
As proofs are verified, the publisher and trainers run the secure sum protocol to aggregate the global model.
Finally, the global model is verified.
The experimental parameters involved in the above procedure are shown in Table <a href="#S8.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ 8 Performance Analysis ‣ Zero-Knowledge Proof-based Practical Federated Learning on Blockchain" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>.
We take the iris classification task as an example to illustrate the experiment process.
In the iris classification task, we have 75 training samples, the model is trained 1,200 times.
Regarding each sample in each iteration as one piece, then we have 90,000 pieces in total.

Considering the error between the approximate function and the original function as 0.0001, we set the approximate function to the fifth-order Taylor expansion.
Next, we convert a training process in fraction into integer form.
We run the integer version training algorithm, while saving all the intermediate values and the local result.
The accuracy of the local result is 96%, which is the same as the original fraction version.
As each piece contains the same computational operation, we compile only one piece of code into ZoK language.
With the arithmetic circuit generated by ZoKrates through the ZoK code, the setup in ZKP is complete.
Then, we can generate the proof of correctness of the computation process in each piece through Groth16 and Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ 5.2 Model Training ‣ 5 The ZKP-FL Scheme ‣ Zero-Knowledge Proof-based Practical Federated Learning on Blockchain" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, with inputs and outputs of each piece saved while training.

Finally, we generate 90,000 ZKPs about the correctness of the whole training process.
It is worth noting that the splitting method is determined based on the memory required for the initialization operation.
The splitting method given in the following table allows the publisher to complete the setup within a memory size of 4GB.</p>

Given the secure sum protocol is an interactive process and consumes less time and computation, the experiment only counts the time spent on the setup, proof generation, and proof verification parts.
If we train the model for the iris classification task without splitting the training algorithm, then during the proof generation process, the memory required to perform the setup will be 30 TiB at least, while the runtime is nearly 1000 days, which is completely unrealistic.
Even if the required arithmetic circuit constraints are obtained, it takes more than 90 days to generate the proofs and more than 25 days to verify them, which is not practical.
Splitting not only makes setup operations practical, but also allows both proof generation and verification operations to be executed in parallel.
The time required for all proof generation and verification operations can be reduced by parallel execution on multiple processors.</p>

<p id="S8.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Another experiment explores the relationship between the size of one piece and the running cost.
Take the price prediction task as an example.
The entire model needs to be trained for 500 rounds.
We define the piece size that splits each round as a piece as 1.
We take 5 different piece sizes, including 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10.
The running cost is shown in Table <a href="#S8.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ 8 Performance Analysis ‣ Zero-Knowledge Proof-based Practical Federated Learning on Blockchain" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a> and Figs. <a href="#S8.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 8 Performance Analysis ‣ Zero-Knowledge Proof-based Practical Federated Learning on Blockchain" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, <a href="#S8.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 8 Performance Analysis ‣ Zero-Knowledge Proof-based Practical Federated Learning on Blockchain" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, and <a href="#S8.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 8 Performance Analysis ‣ Zero-Knowledge Proof-based Practical Federated Learning on Blockchain" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>.
The circuit size (<span id="S8.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.,</span> a set of constraints) is proportional to the size of piece.
It influences the circuit generation time (setup), proof generation time (per proof), file size of proving key and circuit, which are all proportional to the size of piece.
The verification time (per proof), the size of file for verification (verification key, proof) is constant and relatively smaller.
The overall proof generation time is effected by both the size and the number of pieces.
However, as the proof generation can run in parallel, the smaller the piece size, the shorter the overall running time will be for trainers.</p>

<p id="S9.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we have proposed the ZKP-based Federated Learning (ZKP-FL) scheme to protect privacy while achieving accuracy in federated learning tasks.
Specifically, we use ZKP and secure multi-party computation to prove the correctness of local computation and global model parameters without exposing local data and local model parameters.
Then, we propose a Practical ZKP-FL (PZKP-FL) scheme to support fraction and non-linear operations by building a Fraction-Integer mapping and using the Taylor expansion.
Both security and performance of the proposed schemes are also analyzed to demonstrate the PZKP-FL scheme is practical.</p>
