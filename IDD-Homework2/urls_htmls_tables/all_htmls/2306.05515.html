<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">We present PeFLL, a new personalized federated learning algorithm that improves over the state-of-the-art in three aspects: 1) it produces more accurate models, especially in the low-data regime,
and not only for clients present during its training phase, but also for any that may emerge in the future;
2) it reduces the amount of on-client computation and client-server communication by providing future clients with ready-to-use personalized models that require no additional finetuning or optimization;
3) it comes with theoretical guarantees that establish generalization from the observed clients to future ones.</p>
<p id="id5.id2" class="ltx_p">At the core of PeFLL lies a <em id="id5.id2.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">learning-to-learn</em> approach that jointly trains an embedding network and a hypernetwork. The embedding network is used to represent clients in a latent descriptor space in a way that reflects their similarity to each other. The hypernetwork takes as input such descriptors and outputs the parameters of fully personalized client models.
In combination, both networks constitute a learning algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art performance in several personalized federated learning benchmarks.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al., <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> has emerged as a de-facto standard for
privacy-preserving machine learning in a distributed setting, where a
multitude of clients, e.g.<span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text"></span>, user devices, collaboratively learn prediction
models without sharing their data directly with any other party.
In practice, the clients’ data distributions may differ significantly from each other,
which makes learning a single global model sub-optimal <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Kairouz et al., <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>.
Personalized federated learning (pFL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Smith et al., <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> is a means of dealing with such statistical heterogeneity, by allowing clients to learn individual models while still benefiting from each other.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A key challenge of personalized federated learning lies in balancing the benefit of increased data
that is available for joint training with the need to remain faithful to each client’s own
distribution.
Most methods achieve this through a combination of global model training and some form of finetuning
or training of a client-specific model.
However, such an approach has a number of shortcomings.
Consider, for instance, a federated learning system over millions of mobile devices, such as <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Gboard</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Hard et al., <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>. Only a fraction of all possible devices are likely to be seen during training, devices can drop out or in at any time, and it should be possible to produce models also for devices that enter the system at a later time.
Having to train or finetune a new model for each such new device incurs computational costs. This is particularly unfortunate when the computation happens on the client devices, which are typically of low computational power.
Furthermore, high communication costs emerge when model parameters or updates have to be communicated repeatedly between the server and the client.
The summary effect is a high latency before the personalized model is ready for use.
Additionally, the quality of the personalized model is unreliable, as it depends on the amount of data available on the client, which in personalized federated learning tends to be small.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we address all of the above challenges by introducing a new personalized federated learning algorithm.
In PeFLL (for <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Personalized Federated Learning by Learning to Learn</em>), it is the server that produces ready-to-use personalized models for any client by means of a single forward pass through a <em id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">hypernetwork</em>.
The hypernetwork’s input is a descriptor vector, which any client can produce by forward passing some of its data through an <em id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">embedding network</em>.
The output of the hypernetwork is the parameters of a personalized model, which the client can use directly without the need for further training or finetuning.
Thereby <span id="S1.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">PeFLL overcomes the problems of high latency and client-side computation cost</span> in model personalization from which previous approaches suffered
when they required client-side optimization and/or
multi-round client-server communication.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The combined effect of evaluating first the embedding network and then
the hypernetwork constitutes a <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">learning method</em>: it produces model parameters from input data.
The process is parametrized by the networks’ weights, which
PeFLL trains end-to-end across a training set of clients.
This <em id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">learning-to-learn</em> viewpoint allows for a number of
advantageous design choices.
For example, <span id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">PeFLL benefits when many clients are
available for training</span>, where other approaches might
suffer in prediction quality.
The reason is that the client models are created by end-to-end
trained networks, and the more clients participate in the
training and the more diverse these are, the better the
networks’ generalization abilities to future clients.
Also, <span id="S1.p4.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">PeFLL is able to handle clients with small datasets</span>
better than previous approaches.
Because the descriptor evaluation is a feed-forward process, it
is not susceptible to overfitting, as any form of on-client
training or finetuning would be.
At the same time, already during training the client descriptors
are computed from mini-batches, thereby anticipating the setting
of clients with little data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">PeFLL’s strong empirical results, on which we report in Section <a href="#S4" title="4 Experiments ‣ PeFLL: Personalized Federated Learning by Learning to Learn" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> are not a coincidence, but they
can be explained by its roots in theory.
Its training objective is derived from a <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">new generalization bound</span>, which we prove in Section <a href="#S3.SS2" title="3.2 Generalization Guarantees ‣ 3 Method ‣ PeFLL: Personalized Federated Learning by Learning to Learn" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.2</span></a> and which yields tighter bounds in the federated setting than previous ones.
PeFLL’s training procedure distributes the necessary computation between the server and the clients in a way that ensures that the computationally most expensive task happen on the server yet stays truthful to the federated paradigm.
The optimization is stateless, meaning that clients can drop
out of the training set or enter it at any time.
Nevertheless, as we show in Section <a href="#S3.SS1" title="3.1 Convergence Guarantees ‣ 3 Method ‣ PeFLL: Personalized Federated Learning by Learning to Learn" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.1</span></a>, it <span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">converges at a rate comparable to standard federated averaging</span>.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><em id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Personalized federated learning (pFL)</em> is currently one of the promising techniques for learning models that are adapted to individual clients’ data distributions without jeopardizing their privacy.
Existing approaches typically follow one of multiple blueprints:

between clients, e.g.<span id="S2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text"></span> through regularization towards a central model.
<em id="S2.p1.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Meta-learning methods</em> learn a shared model, which
the clients can quickly adapt or finetune to their individual data
distributions, e.g.<span id="S2.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text"></span> by a small number of gradient updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Fallah et al., <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Jiang et al., <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Wu et al., <a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023a</a>)</cite>.

parameters into two groups: those that are meant to be shared between clients (e.g.<span id="S2.p1.1.7" class="ltx_text"></span> a feature representation) and those that are learned on a per-client basis (e.g.<span id="S2.p1.1.8" class="ltx_text"></span> classification heads).

divide the clients into a fixed number of subgroups and learn individual models for each cluster.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><em id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Hypernetworks</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ha et al., <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> have only recently been employed in the context of pFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ma et al., <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Yi et al., <a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>.
Typically, the hypernetworks reside on the clients, which limits the methods’ efficiency.
Closest to our work are <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Shamsian et al. (<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> and
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Li et al. (<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>, which also generate each clients’ personalized model using server-side hypernetworks.
These works adopt a non-parametric approach in which the server learns and stores individual descriptor vectors per client.
However, such an approach has a number of downsides.
First, it entails a stateful optimization problem, which is undesirable because it means the server has to know at any time in advance which client is participating in training to retrieve their descriptors.
Second, the number of parameters stored at the server grows with the number of clients, which can cause scalability issues in large-scale applications.
Finally, in such a setting the hypernetwork can only be evaluated for clients with which the server has interactive before. For new clients, descriptors must first to be inferred, and this requires an optimization
procedure with multiple client-server communication rounds.
In contrast, in PeFLL the server learns just the embedding network, and the client descriptors are computed on-the-fly using just forward-evaluations on the clients.
As a consequence, clients can drop in or out at any time, any number of clients can be handled with a fixed memory budget, and even for previously unseen clients, no iterative optimization is required.</p>

In this work, we use the term <em id="S2.p3.1.7" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">learning-to-learn</em>, because it best describes the aspect that the central object that PeFLL learns is a mechanism for

<p id="S3.p7.1" class="ltx_p">The above analysis shows that PeFLL has a number of desirable properties:
<span id="S3.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">1) It distributes the necessary computation in a
client-friendly way</span>.
The hypernetwork is stored on the server and evaluated
only there. It is also never sent via the communication channel.
This is important, because hypernetworks can be quite
large, as already their output layer must have as
many neurons as the total number of parameters of
the client model.
Therefore, they tend to have high memory and computational
requirements, which client devices might not be able
to provide.</p>

<div id="S3.p8" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.p8.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S3.p8.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">2) It has low latency and communication cost.</span>
Generating a model for any client requires
communicating only few and small quantities:
a) the parameters of the embedding network,
which are typically small, b) the client descriptors,
which are low dimensional vectors, and c) the
personalized models, which typically also can
be kept small, because they only have to solve
client-specific rather than general-purpose tasks.
For the backward pass in the training phase, three
additional quantities need to be communicated:
a) the clients’ suggested
parameter updates, which are of equal size as the
model parameters, b) gradients with respect to the
client descriptors, which are of equal size as the
descriptors, and c) the embedding network’s updates,
which are of the same size as the embedding network.
All of these quantities are rather small compared
to, e.g.<span id="S3.p8.1.2" class="ltx_text"></span>, the size of the hypernetwork, which
PeFLL avoids sending.</p>

<p id="S3.p9.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S3.p9.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">3) It respects the federated paradigm.</span>
Clients are not required to share their training data but
only their descriptors and—during training—the gradient
of the loss with respect to the model parameters.
Both of these are computed locally on the client
devices.
Note that we do not aim for formal privacy guarantees
in this work. These could, in principle, be provided
by incorporating

Since a descriptor is an average of a batch of embeddings, this step can be made differentially private with some added noise using standard DP techniques such as Gaussian or Laplace mechanisms.
This, however, could add the need for additional trade-offs, so we leave the analysis to future work.</p>

our result of independent interest: 1) due to the non-linearity
of the hypernetwork, gradients computed from batches might
not be unbiased; 2) the updates to the network parameters
are not simple averages, but consist of multiple gradient steps
on the clients, which the server processes further using
the chain rule;
3) the objective includes regularization terms that only the

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.10" class="ltx_p">In this section, we prove a generalization bound that
justifies PeFLL’s learning objective.
Following prior work in learning-to-learn theory
we adopt a PAC-Bayesian framework.
For this, we assume that the embedding network,
the hypernetwork and the personalized models are
all learned stochastically.

models on future clients (which is the actual quantity of interest) can be controlled
by the empirical loss on the observed clients’ data (which we can compute) plus
two terms that resemble regularizers. The first term penalizes extreme values in
the parameters of the hypernetwork and the embedding network.
Thereby, it prevents overfitting for the part of the learning process
that accumulates information across clients.
The second term penalizes extreme values in the output of the hypernetwork,
which are the parameters of the per-client models. By this, it prevents
overfitting on each client.
Because the guarantee holds uniformly over all parameter vectors,
we can optimize the right hand side with respect to <math id="S3.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\eta" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S3.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">η</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S3.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝜂</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.m1.1c">\eta</annotation></semantics></math>

The PeFLL objective is modeled after the right hand side of

we drop constant terms and use just the mean vectors of the network
parameters instead of sampling them stochastically. Also, we drop the
square roots from the regularization terms to make them numerically
better behaved.</p>

With the exception of kNN-Per all other methods require some form of finetuning in order to obtain personalized models for new clients. Per-FedAvg and pFedMe obtain personal models by finetuning the global model locally at each client for some small number of gradient steps. FedRep freezes the global feature extractor and optimizes a randomly initialized head locally at each new client. pFedHN freezes the trained hypernetwork and optimizes a new embedding vector for each new client, which requires not just local training but also several communication rounds with the server. The most efficient baseline for inference on a new client is kNN-Per, which requires only a single forward pass through the trained global model and the evaluation of a <math id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="k" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">k</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝑘</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1c">k</annotation></semantics></math>-nearest-neighbor-based predictor.</p>

For our experiments the hypernetwork is a three layer fully connected network which takes as input a client descriptor vector, <math id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="v\in\mathbb{R}^{l}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">v</mi><mo id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">∈</mo><msup id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2" xref="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml">ℝ</mi><mi id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3" xref="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml">l</mi></msup></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.1.m1.1.1"><in id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1"></in><ci id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝑣</ci><apply id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2">ℝ</ci><ci id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3">𝑙</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.1.m1.1c">v\in\mathbb{R}^{l}</annotation></semantics></math>, and outputs the parameters of the client model, <math id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\theta\in\mathbb{R}^{d}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">θ</mi><mo id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">∈</mo><msup id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2" xref="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2.cmml">ℝ</mi><mi id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3" xref="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3.cmml">d</mi></msup></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.2.m2.1.1"><in id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.2.m2.1.1.1"></in><ci id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.2.m2.1.1.2">𝜃</ci><apply id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2">ℝ</ci><ci id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3">𝑑</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.2.m2.1c">\theta\in\mathbb{R}^{d}</annotation></semantics></math>.

Note that the final layer of the client model predicts across all classes in the dataset. In case that a client knows which classes it wishes to predict for (e.g.<span id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.3.1" class="ltx_text"></span> from its training data) it can select only the outputs for those classes.
For the embedding network we tested two options, a single linear projection which takes as input a one-hot encoded label vector, and a LeNet-type ConvNet with the same architecture as the client models except that its input is extended by <math id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="C" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.3.m3.1a"><mi id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.3.m3.1.1" xref="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml">C</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.3.m3.1b"><ci id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.3.m3.1.1">𝐶</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.3.m3.1c">C</annotation></semantics></math> extra channels that encode the label in one-hot form.
The choice of such small models for our embedding network is consistent with the fact that the embedding network must be transmitted to the client. We find that for CIFAR10 and FEMNIST the ConvNet embedding network produces the best results while for CIFAR100 the linear embedding is best, and these are the results we report.</p>

For FEMNIST we fix the number of clients participating per round to 5.
The Local baseline trains on each client independently for 200 epochs.
The hyperparameters for all methods are tuned using validation data that was
held out from the training set (10,000 samples for CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, spread across the clients, and 10% of each client’s data for FEMNIST).
The optimizer used for training at the client is SGD with a batch size of 32, a learning rate chosen via grid search and momentum set to 0.9. The batch size used for computing the descriptor is also 32.
More details of the hyperparameter selection for each method as well as ablation studies are provided in Appendix <a href="#A1" title="Appendix A Appendix - Experiments ‣ PeFLL: Personalized Federated Learning by Learning to Learn" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">A</span></a>.</p>

In all cases, we report the test set accuracy on the clients that were used for

<span id="S4.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">PeFLL achieves the best results in all cases,
and often by a large margin.</span>
The improvements over previous methods are most prominent for previously unseen clients, for which PeFLL produces model of almost identical
accuracy as for the clients used for training.
This is especially remarkable in light of the fact that several of the other
methods have computationally more expensive procedures for generating models
in this setting than PeFLL, in particular requiring on-client or even
federated training to produce the personalized models.
We see this result as a strong evidence that PeFLL successful generalizes, as predicted by Theorem <a href="#S3.Thmtheorem2" title="Theorem 3.2. ‣ 3.2 Generalization Guarantees ‣ 3 Method ‣ PeFLL: Personalized Federated Learning by Learning to Learn" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.2</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Comparing PeFLL’s results to the most similar baseline, pFedHN,
one observes that the latter’s performance decreases noticeably
when the number of clients increases and the number of samples
per client decrease accordingly.
We attribute this to the fact that pFedHN learns independent client
descriptors for each client, which can become unreliable if only
few training examples are available for each client.
Similarly, for Per-FedAvg, pFedMe and FedRep, which construct personalized models
by local finetuning, the model accuracy drops when the amount
of data per client decreases, especially in the more challenging
CIFAR100 setup. kNN-Per maintains good generalization from train to unseen clients, but its performance worsens when the number of samples per client drops and the kNN predictors have less client data available.
In contrast, PeFLL’s performance remains stable, which
we attribute to the fact that it learns the embedding
and hypernetwork jointly from all available data.
The new client does not have to use its data for training or finetuning, but
rather just to generate a client descriptor. As a pure feed-forward process, this step does not suffer from overfitting in the low-data regime.</p>

Figure <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ Analysis of Client Descriptors ‣ 4.1 Results ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ PeFLL: Personalized Federated Learning by Learning to Learn" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> shows the average of this value across
the unseen clients after different numbers of training steps
(CIFAR 10 dataset, 1000 clients in total).
One can see that the rank correlation increases over the course of training, reaching very high correlation values of approximately 0.93. Results for
other numbers of clients are comparable, see Appendix <a href="#A1" title="Appendix A Appendix - Experiments ‣ PeFLL: Personalized Federated Learning by Learning to Learn" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">A</span></a>.
This indicates that the embedding network indeed learns to organize the descriptor space according to client distributional similarity, with similar clients being mapped to similar descriptors.
Moreover, because these results are obtained from unseen clients,
it is clear that the effect does not reflect potential overfitting
of the embedding network to the training clients, but that the learned similarity indeed
generalizes well.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we presented PeFLL, a new algorithm for personalized federated learning based on learning-to-learn.
By means of an embedding network that creates inputs to a hypernetwork it efficiently generates personalized models, both for clients present during training and new clients that appear later.
PeFLL has several desirable properties for real-world usability.
It stands on solid theoretical foundation in terms of convergence and generalization.
It is trained by stateless optimization and does not require additional training steps to obtain models for new clients.
Overall, it has low latency and puts little computational burden on the clients, making it practical to use in large scale applications with many clients each possessing little data.

The results are shown in Table <a href="#A1.T6" title="Table 6 ‣ Regularization Parameters. ‣ A.4 Ablation Studies ‣ Appendix A Appendix - Experiments ‣ PeFLL: Personalized Federated Learning by Learning to Learn" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>.
As one can see, PeFLL’s performance is rather robust over the regularization strengthh.
However, consistent with the theory, modest amounts of hypernetwork regularization parameter help preventing overfitting on training clients and improve client-level generalization.
Similarly, modest amounts of client regularization improve sample-level generalization.
As can be expected, very large values of this parameter
leads to underfitting.</p>
