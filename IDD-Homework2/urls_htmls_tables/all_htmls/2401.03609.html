<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">The use of machine learning (ML) for cancer staging through medical image analysis has gained substantial interest across medical disciplines. When accompanied by the innovative federated learning (FL) framework, ML techniques can further overcome privacy concerns related to patient data exposure.
Given the frequent presence of diverse data modalities within patient records, leveraging FL in a multi-modal learning framework holds considerable promise for cancer staging.
However, existing works on multi-modal FL often presume that all data-collecting institutions have access to all data modalities. This oversimplified approach neglects institutions that have access to only a portion of data modalities within the system.
In this work, we introduce a novel FL architecture designed to accommodate not only the heterogeneity of data samples, but also the inherent heterogeneity/non-uniformity of data modalities across institutions. We shed light on the challenges associated with varying convergence speeds observed across different data modalities within our FL system. Subsequently, we propose a solution to tackle these challenges by devising a distributed gradient blending and proximity-aware client weighting strategy tailored for multi-modal FL.
To show the superiority of our method, we conduct experiments using <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">The Cancer Genome Atlas program (TCGA)</span> datalake considering different cancer types and three modalities of data: mRNA sequences, histopathological image data, and clinical information.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Leveraging medical images to derive machine learning (ML) models for aiding in cancer staging and developing effective treatment strategies has shown significant success <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
Traditionally, despite the existence of multiple modalities of data (e.g., computed tomography (CT) scans <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> and histopathological images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>), ML models (e.g., MLPs, CNNs, and LSTMs) are trained with one of data modalities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
However, as research revealed the benefits of multi-modal ML <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, modern approaches have utilized multiple data types/modalities such as mRNA sequences and clinical information together to obtain ML models for medical applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The majority of existing studies on
multi-modal ML within the medical domain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> presume a <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">centralized ML model training architecture</span>: ML models are trained at a module (e.g., a server) with access to a repository of patient data.
However, since patient
data is often distributed across various data collection units
(e.g., hospitals, clinics), the centralized approach
necessitates the transfer of patient data across the network
to a centralized location, raising data privacy
concerns.
Researchers have thus explored alternative ML approaches, a notable example of which is federated learning
(FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In FL, each data collecting institution, referred to as a <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">client</span>, independently trains a local ML model using its data. These local ML models are periodically aggregated by a server to construct a <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">global model</span>. The global model is disseminated to clients to commence their next local ML model training cycle.
Consequently, FL replaces the transmission of raw data across the network with the transmission of ML models, thus preserving data privacy.
As a result, the adoption of FL within the medical domain is gaining substantial traction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.
Given the diversity of data types/modalities across FL clients in medical domain, such as hospitals and clinics, the prospect of employing FL within a multi-modal learning context is particularly enticing. Although FL and multi-modal ML have been jointly studied recently <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, a common constraint in these studies is the assumption that each client has access to all data modalities.
In real-world scenarios, this assumption often does not hold: for example, a hospital may collect mRNA sequences and histopathological images, while a clinic may collect only CT scans and clinical information.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we take an initial step towards implementing multi-modal FL in a scenario where clients not only have non-iid (non-independent and identically distributed) data, but also possess an uneven number of data modalities. We present a system model that eliminates the need for clients to possess identical sets of data modalities by employing a versatile distributed encoder-decoder architecture.
Within this framework, the encoders are tasked with the extraction of features from each distinct data modality at each client. These encoders and decoders/classifiers will undergo separate aggregations in order to address the heterogeneity of modalities across clients. This approach ensures that all trainable components relevant to a specific data modality are collectively trained using the data of that particular modality across all clients. The final global model resulting from this training can then be applied over the combination of all data modalities.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">We show that while our proposed system model holds considerable promise, it confronts a series of challenges. A notable concern is the disparity in the training and convergence speeds of various data modalities among different clients. This variability can lead to certain encoders rapidly exhibiting a biased behavior towards local data of clients, which can impede the global model’s convergence.<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>This phenomenon, in turn, may result in overfitting toward specific data labels, particularly in the context of generic FL classification tasks, due to the imbalanced effect of each modality during local ML training.</span></span></span>
To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel approach termed <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">distributed gradient blending</span> (DGB) for FL. Although conceptually distinct, this approach draws inspiration from a seminal work on centralized multi-model ML <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. Our proposed DGB method capitalizes on information pertaining to the performance of participating clients in FL and the characteristics of their respective modalities to determine effective back-propagation weights for local training of each encoder at each client.
To further enhance the robustness of our proposed method against non-iid data distribution across the clients, we propose <span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">proximity-aware client weighting</span> (PCW). PCW considers the quality of data at clients to further enhance the parameters utilized in DGB.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we review the existing literature on cancer staging using ML methods and the expansions and contributions of FL to this active research area. Henceforth, we use the terminology of <span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ML models</span> to refer to deep neural networks.</p>

In most of the early works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, only one modality of data is used in order to train the ML models. Thus, the ML models developed in these works take an input datapoint of a specific modality (e.g., PET/CT image or histopathological image) and pass it through – either raw or preprocessed – to predict its class (e.g., the cancer stage). As a result, most of the recent efforts in this area  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, have been focused on optimizing the ML model architecture and developing effective data preprocessing methodologies. However, the aformentioned studies overlook the proliferation of diverse data modalities that hold the potential to significantly enhance the accuracy of ML models for cancer prediction and staging. Moreover, these studies often make the assumption of unrestricted access to a comprehensive reservoir of patient data, the acquisition of which is becoming increasingly challenging due to the concerns regarding data privacy. In this work, we aim to address both of these issues by proposing multi-modal FL and resolving the challenges it comes with.</p>

<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Multi-Modal Cancer Staging.</span>
Researchers have investigated the advantages of leveraging diverse data modalities for cancer prognosis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. For instance, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, the authors demonstrated the significant impact of incorporating histopathological images, gene expression data, and clinical data on the performance of ML models used for cancer staging. Also, the utilization of CT scan data, clinical data, and selected deep-learning-based radiomics data in cancer recurrence prediction has yielded similar ML prediction enhancements in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Nevertheless, these studies mostly operate within a centralized ML training architecture, where the ML training module, often hosted on a central server, is assumed to have access to a large-scale repository of patient data. This assumption limits the applicability of these findings in real-world scenarios where patient data is distributed across multiple medical institutions, pooling of which in a centralized location raises major concerns regarding leakage of patients’ information.
Our contribution to this literature lies in the proposition of a distributed ML architecture inspired by FL that eliminates the need for patients data transfer, while explicitly accommodating the diversity of data modalities across distinct data collection institutions.</p>

Motivated by the privacy concerns associated with the transfer of data across the network, there has been a notable interest in the application of distributed ML techniques, with particular attention directed towards FL, in various fields of studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.
Nevertheless, majority of works on FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> presume the existence of single modality of data across the clients, and thus cannot be easily deployed in systems with multiple modalities of data.</p>

<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Multi-modal FL for Cancer Classification.</span>
Multi-modal FL has recently attracted notable attention within the research community of various fields, such as healthcare and machine vision <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>,
among which, considering medical applications, several endeavors stand out <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, an FL system effectively incorporates both X-ray and Ultrasound modalities. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, multi-modal FL is proposed with skin lesion images and their corresponding clinical data for melanoma detection. However, a common thread runs through all of the previous works, implying both to the general context of multi-modal FL and the cases where it has been applied to medical topics: they all operate under the assumption that every client has access to (and collects) <span id="S2.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">all</span> of data modalities.
In practice this assumption often encounters limitations in the medical domain as data collection institutions often gather only a subset of data modalities; for instance, one hospital may gather different gene expression data and clinical data, while another may collect CT scans. Our work is among the first in the literature to introduce an effective FL paradigm across clients with an uneven distribution/number of data modalities.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In real-world scenarios, institutions may have access to various subsets of modalities. This phenomenon makes the conventional multi-modal FL, which is based on naïve extension of uni-modal FL to multi-modal settings <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> impractical, as these works presume the existence of the same set of data modalities across all the institutions.
In particular, in a network of institutions with non-uniform number of data modalities, the number of encoders used across them will differ. Further, the size of the input feature fed to the classifier will also vary across institutions. These variabilities make the naïve ML training and aggregation methods of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> ineffective.
Consequently, we propose a generalized distributed encoder-decoder architecture, which increases the flexibility of model aggregations at the server by aggregating (i) each modality’s encoder and (ii) classifiers of different existing modality combinations across the institutions separately.

As will be formalized next, to handle clients with an uneven distribution of modalities, we will put a greater emphasis on improving the local training of encoders. This approach diverges from the recent methodologies in multi-modal FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, where the emphasis lies on aggregating the classification layers – and co-attention layers – which adapt well to scenarios where clients have access to all the modalities. This paradigm shift allows our approach to extend the distributed ML training framework of FL for each modality to all institutions possessing data pertaining to that specific modality. In particular, in our approach, the encoder used for each modality would benefit from the commonality of data across the institutions possessing that modality. This, in turn, eliminates the restricting assumption that institutions must possess all data modalities.</p>

Loss plots of the global models based on the modalities possessed across institutions in the first 100 global aggregation rounds.
Plots consider various modality combinations: (a) image and mRNA modalities, (b) clinical and mRNA, and (c) image and clinical.
The shaded areas represent the noise (20% standard deviation) for each combination of modalities tested. A key observation is the occasional degradation of the performance of the multi-modal ML models compared to their single-modal counterparts. This observation is consistent with the claims in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> which emphasises on the necessity of syncing the convergence rates of the modalities in a multi-modal FL scenario. Further, our method leads to the balance of convergence rates across the modalities.

As can be seen in the figure, the performance of some
modalities is notably better than the others, as the losses are decreasing faster for those modalities but the same does not apply to others. Furthermore, during the local training phase, the ML model of some modality combinations has converged notably faster than the rest. Also, some modalities struggle to improve their loss and accuracy during the ML model training.
We next aim to propose a framework to address these issues, the result of which is labelled as <span id="S3.SS4.p1.4.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ours</span> in the plots in Fig. <a href="#S3.F3" title="Fig. 3 ‣ III-C4 Local Model Transfer and Global Model Aggregations ‣ III-C Federated Learning over Unbalanced Modalities ‣ III Network and Learning Model ‣ Multi-Modal Federated Learning for Cancer Staging over Non-IID Datasets with Unbalanced Modalities" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.

DGB achieves this through acquiring a set of train and validation losses from each institution at the end of each local ML training round, which is in turn used to calculate two metrics of <span id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">overfitting</span> and <span id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">generalization</span>.

PCW tunes the weights/importance of ML models of institutions during the system-wide DGB weight calculation based on the trajectory of models’ –both local and global– gradients.
Specifically, PCW assigns greater importance to institutions whose local ML parameters’ trajectory exhibit a closer alignment with that of the global model. This signifies that institutions with superior data quality (i.e., diverse local datasets that better encapsulate the global data distribution, and thus do not induce bias onto the locally trained ML model), will have a more pronounced influence on the calculation of DGB weights. By mitigating the impact of local ML model bias, PCW makes DGB robust against the increase in the number of local SGD iterations <math id="S4.I1.i2.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="K" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.I1.i2.p1.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S4.I1.i2.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">K</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.I1.i2.p1.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S4.I1.i2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.2.m2.1.1">𝐾</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.I1.i2.p1.2.m2.1c">K</annotation></semantics></math> in each global aggregation (i.e., reductions in uplink transmission frequency).</p>

<p id="Thmremark1.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="Thmremark1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">The issue of varying convergence rates across modalities has also been observed in conventional centralized multi-modal ML <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. To address this issue, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> proposed a methodology, called gradient blending (GB), for centralized ML settings, which entails the use of a separate loss for each modality and a multi-modal model loss, weighting gradients non-uniformly when back-propagated over the ML model during training.
As a result, since our methodology is inspired by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, although it contains multiple nuances and differences compared to the method developed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, we call it Distributed Gradient Blending (DGB). In particular, our method differs significantly from the naïve extension of GB to the FL setting as done in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>.
In particular, existing methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> use multiple sub-networks (i.e., one set of encoder and classifier for each modality), and thus, multiple losses to back-propagate during ML model training. In contrast, our work does not entail using multiple sub-networks; instead, we use only one classifier in each institution’s ML model alongside separate encoders dedicated to various modalities. We further use only one loss function and weigh its resulting gradient vector elements based on the encoder they belong to. This reduces the computation complexity of our method and the number of model parameters to train in each institution.
Also, in addition to having a higher number of parameters, in the naïve implementations of gradient blending <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, the methods require the train data available (<math id="Thmremark1.p1.1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathcal{D}_{n}^{\mathsf{Tr}}" display="inline"><semantics id="Thmremark1.p1.1.1.m1.1a"><msubsup id="Thmremark1.p1.1.1.m1.1.1" xref="Thmremark1.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" id="Thmremark1.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.2.2" xref="Thmremark1.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml">𝒟</mi><mi id="Thmremark1.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.2.3" xref="Thmremark1.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml">n</mi><mi id="Thmremark1.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="Thmremark1.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">𝖳𝗋</mi></msubsup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="Thmremark1.p1.1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="Thmremark1.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="Thmremark1.p1.1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="Thmremark1.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="Thmremark1.p1.1.1.m1.1.1">superscript</csymbol><apply id="Thmremark1.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="Thmremark1.p1.1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="Thmremark1.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="Thmremark1.p1.1.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="Thmremark1.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="Thmremark1.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.2.2">𝒟</ci><ci id="Thmremark1.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="Thmremark1.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.2.3">𝑛</ci></apply><ci id="Thmremark1.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="Thmremark1.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3">𝖳𝗋</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="Thmremark1.p1.1.1.m1.1c">\mathcal{D}_{n}^{\mathsf{Tr}}</annotation></semantics></math>) to be split into two sections, one of which is used for the calculation of the overfitting to generalization ratio. This raises challenges when facing a scenario with scarce data, which is frequent in medical domains given the labor needed to annotate data. Our method, on the other hand, uses system-wide characteristics and values of the losses to calculate the DOGR which removes the necessity to have each of the train and validation data to be split into two at each institution, enabling more compatibility with data-scarce scenarios.
More importantly, we address the side-effects of non-iid data on the performance of multi-modal FL through PCW, which makes DGB outperform the existing methodologies.</span></p>

This measure is defined based on the quality of local datasets of institutions. In order to obtain this measure, we rely on a key observation: considering that the ML models at institutions are initialized with a unique global model at the beginning of each local training round, the difference in their local gradient trajectories is an indicator of the difference in their local data distributions.
Furthermore, the difference/closeness between the local gradient trajectories and the gradient trajectory of the global model is an indicator of the similarity of local datasets to the global dataset (i.e., institutions with higher similarity of local gradient trajectory to that of the global model have a closer local data distribution to that of global dataset).</p>

Therefore, the institutions where data induces more bias should be given a smaller weight/importance when calculating the average loss, which will determine the DGB weights for all institutions.

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We use datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas program (TCGA) for three cancer types, namely, Breast Invasive Carcinoma (BRCA), Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LUSC), and Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (LIHC), to make up for the heterogeneity of local datasets across clients.

<p id="S5.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We consider the first baseline to measure the system’s performance under the conventional methods (i.e., FedAvg aggregation and local training using SGD), which is the naïve extension of FL to multi-modal setting as described in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. We will demonstrate that this approach will perform poorly over unbalanced modalities across the institutions.
The second baseline <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> implements a federated version of gradient blending introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, which is not tailored to address the problem of uneven number of modalities across institutions. This baseline also relies on tuning the global model aggregations weights, which is different from our method.
Further, our method removes the necessity to split the training data at each institution, as done in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, to calculate the gradient blending weights. This is reflected in our formulation (<a href="#S4.E20" title="In IV-C Proximity-Aware Client Weighting (PCW) ‣ IV Distributed Gradient Blending and Proximity-Aware Client Weighting Approach ‣ Multi-Modal Federated Learning for Cancer Staging over Non-IID Datasets with Unbalanced Modalities" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">20</span></a>) where we aggregate all of the loss values needed to calculate the DGB parameters based on the modality combination of the institutions to get a distributed calculation of these parameters. Avoiding splitting the dataset in data-scarce scenarios such as ours, and generally, most medical applications, can (later shown in Table <a href="#S5.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ V-E1 ML training under different learning methods ‣ V-E Results and Discussions ‣ V Numerical Experiments ‣ Multi-Modal Federated Learning for Cancer Staging over Non-IID Datasets with Unbalanced Modalities" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>) improve the outcome of the federated learning. We further complement our method with PCW, which as will be shown later will give us performance edge.
In the third baseline, we aim to measure the base performance of our proposed DGB and demonstrate the performance gain we get by employing the method. Although we use this method as a baseline, we will later show that this method outperforms the state-of-the-art, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, due to consideration of different convergence speeds across various modalities.</p>

<div id="S5.SS5.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS5.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To test the performance of our method against the baselines, we devised an experiment trying to simulate the methods under the same circumstances. In particular, all of the ML models start from the same initial point/model in order to avoid having random initial weights affect the performance of the models. We took the datasets mentioned in Sec. <a href="#S5.SS1" title="V-A Dataset and Data Distribution ‣ V Numerical Experiments ‣ Multi-Modal Federated Learning for Cancer Staging over Non-IID Datasets with Unbalanced Modalities" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">V-A</span></span></a> and created different subsets from each of them to account for the multiple institutions that we have in our network. We acquired the results gathered in Table <a href="#S5.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ V-E1 ML training under different learning methods ‣ V-E Results and Discussions ‣ V Numerical Experiments ‣ Multi-Modal Federated Learning for Cancer Staging over Non-IID Datasets with Unbalanced Modalities" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a> for the evolution of performance of each method over time. As can be seen, <span id="S5.SS5.SSS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">CM-FL + DGB</span> already surpasses the <span id="S5.SS5.SSS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">CM-FL</span> method. However, as the training proceeds, using our entire methodology with the addition of PCW, we can see a better performance. This reveals that the client weighting method used in PCW, although it can slow down the training at the beginning, can effectively circumvent the local ML model bias, especially as ML training proceeds.
The table further shows that,
due to the unique challenges introduced by the unbalanced distribution of data modalities and labels, baselines that are not designed to handle such non-uniformaties (CM-FL, HGB-FL) fail to train the model effectively.</p>

<div id="S5.SS5.SSS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS5.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In addition to heterogeneity of number of modalities across the system, the quality of data of each modality is different across institutions (i.e., some modalities may contribute more to the overall performance of the ML model as compared to the rest).
To investigate this,
we train the ML models and gather the accuracy of the global model under availability of different subsets of modalities across institutions in Table <a href="#S5.T5" title="TABLE V ‣ V-E3 ML training under different number of modalities involved ‣ V-E Results and Discussions ‣ V Numerical Experiments ‣ Multi-Modal Federated Learning for Cancer Staging over Non-IID Datasets with Unbalanced Modalities" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">V</span></a>. The results show that our method outperforms the baselines under various data qualities. Also, the clinical data shows the lowest quality data as it leads to the lowest performance when combined with other modalities, while the mRNA modality has the highest quality data. This observation can further open the door to research on multi-modal FL in the presence of different quality data and attention mechanisms, which can put non-uniform emphasis on different types of data.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we developed the system model for multi-modal FL over institutions with non-iid data and unbalanced number of modalities. To address disparate convergence rates across the various modalities involved in the system, we proposed DGB, weighing the gradients of different modalities in a non-uniform fashion. Further, to address the impact of non-iid data and the local model bias on the performance of DGB, we proposed PCW which takes into account the quality of data at institutions for refining the system-wide loss estimates fed to DGB. We demonstrated that our proposed methodology can outperform the state-of-the-art methods. Our proposed DGB and PCW methods are generic and can be used in other tasks such as Alzheimer’s disease prediction with data modalities of CT and PET scans, the exploration of which is left as future work. Other future directions include using generative adversarial networks (GANs) to replicate the missing modalities at each institution. Also, introducing distributed modality-aware attention mechanisms is a promising research direction.</p>
