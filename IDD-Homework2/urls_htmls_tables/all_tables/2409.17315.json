            "To generate realistic privacy preserving synthetic data, while addressing the problems of limited diversity of sensitive attributes, complexity of discrete attributes, and domain restrictions, we propose a framework for Knowledge Infusion in Privacy Preserving Synthetic Data Generation (KIPPS). The novel framework introduces knowledge guidance from a domain Knowledge Graph (KG) into the training of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to address the problems of class imbalance and cross-correlation in attributes. The overall architecture for our proposed framework is illustrated in Figure  1 . The model is designed to satisfy 3 key requirements: 1. Provide domain context to limited and complex attributes 2. Enforce domain constraints in generated data 3. Satisfy Privacy Constraints in Synthetic Data. To satisfy these objectives, we break the KIPPS training into three phases:",
            "The results for fidelity evaluation indicate that KIPPS performs favorably in several metrics compared to the other models. The results have been presented in Table  1 . Here are the key points highlighting the strengths of KIPPS:"
