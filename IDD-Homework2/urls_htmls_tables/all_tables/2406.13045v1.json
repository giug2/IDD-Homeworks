            "In this paper, we argue that current AE guidelines are insufficient to capture the unique challenges presented by distributed systems. We start by comprehensively reviewing the history of efforts to improve reproducibility and repeatability in computer science research (see Sec.\u00a02). We then describe the approach used to characterize AE practices in this work, including the study process, results, and threats to the validity of our results (see Sec.\u00a04). We then review recent AE procedures (but not the evaluation of particular artifacts) and highlight challenges unique to distributed systems (see Sec.\u00a05). We conclude by making recommendations to help artifact authors, artifact reviewers, and AET chairs (see Sec.\u00a06). While many seem obvious or trivial, we bring evidence that these recommendations are not universally followed (see Table\u00a03).\nFurthermore, we believe these recommendations are specific to distributed systems research, as they may lead to a sound and repeatable way for artifact implementation and evaluation. In contrast, other studies highlighted such recommendations primarily for experiment designing and result reporting\u00a0<cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep\">(<a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2406.13045v1#bib.bib46\" title=\"\">papadopoulos2019methodological, </a>)</cite>. Finally, we summarize our main findings and recommendations (see \n(papadopoulos2019methodological, ). Finally, we summarize our main findings and recommendations (see Sec.\u00a07) as checklists for both artifact authors and AE committees (see Appendices\u00a0A and\u00a0B).",
            "For each conference and year, we cross-referenced and categorized the current practices and lessons learned documented in the corresponding calls for artifacts. All recommendations provided by the studied conferences are listed in Table\u00a03.",
            "To improve the state of repeatability and reproducibility in distributed systems research, we review the practices for artifacts and procedures for their evaluation that are applied at the recent conferences listed in Sec.\u00a04. The first general insight from this review is that around half of the studied conferences followed the recommendations of the cTuning foundation\u00a0<cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep\">(<a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2406.13045v1#bib.bib17\" title=\"\">ctuning, </a>)</cite>. While the recommendations outlined in the studied conferences are comprehensive, a key issue, as discussed in \n(ctuning, ). While the recommendations outlined in the studied conferences are comprehensive, a key issue, as discussed in Sec.\u00a06, lies in their effective execution. We propose that even if these existing practices are followed, challenges or insufficiencies may persist when attempting to reproduce the artifacts, as evidenced by experience from past conferences and journals. The recommendations provided at the studied conferences are summarized in Table\u00a03.",
            "We believe that implementing all of the recommendations described in the preceding section would greatly improve the AE process and the repeatability and reproducibility of distributed systems research. However, as shown in Table\u00a03, not all of these recommendations are currently implemented in the conferences. Therefore, existing practices for artifacts and procedures for their evaluation need refinement. In this section, we offer a set of recommendations based on our own experiences of AE procedures that could be added to the existing recommendations discussed in Sec.\u00a05. Some of these recommendations may have been previously presented or used by other research communities, including in distributed systems, but to date, they have not been summarized in the following manner for the benefit of our community.",
            "Reproducibility and repeatability are cornerstones of science. Despite their importance, various studies have shown a reproducibility crisis spanning multiple scientific fields and that many published studies cannot be replicated. The situation can be even worse in disturbed systems research, as work in this area may require access to large-scale and/or specialized hardware, and it is difficult to fully automate repeatable experiments in ways that make them accessible to anybody. While some strategies for promoting reproducibility have been developed within the distributed systems community, including artifact evaluation processes, our answer to the question of how unified existing artifact evaluation practices are in distributed systems research indicates that artifact evaluation practices in distributed systems research currently lag behind those used in other areas of computer science, are less unified, and are generally more complex (as shown in Table\u00a03)."
