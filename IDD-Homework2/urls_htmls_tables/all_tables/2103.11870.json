                "Within the smart grid domain, there are two most commonly observed types of data separation. The first type is known as horizontal data separation, where all parties hold different training samples, but these samples share the same set of features and labels (",
                "Fig. 2(a)",
                "). For example, household-level and district-level power consumption data are recorded by numerous sensor networks and transformer stations distributed across cities. Under this construct, all parties are considered homogeneous as they hold similar information of each sample. They can choose to train models separately, but a collaborative training scheme would greatly enrich the training set, contributing to a high generalization performance of the resulting models. The collaboration is easier to achieve since these parties, typically operated by the same power company, have little curious or malicious intentions over each other. Nevertheless, raw data are still preferred not to be transferred directly, as eavesdroppers might easily intercept these information.",
                "On the other hand, data might be separated in a way that the parties hold different features over the same set of samples (",
                "Fig. 2(b)",
                "). This is known as vertical data separation. For example, besides power consumption data, there might also be demographics or weather data that are highly related to power, but held by external parties whose benefits would compromised if data are exchanged. Under this construct, all parties are considered heterogeneous as they hold different feature sets, and collaborative training would be preferred with complementary features as additional inputs. Raw datasets are naturally forbidden to be transferred across parties; even the intermediate model parameters need to be effectively encrypted before transferral.",
                "It can be seen that for both types of data separation, it is necessary to construct a secure and reliable framework for multiple parties to train a model collaboratively.

            "The 21st century has witnessed an increasingly digitalized and intelligent power grid. The widely distributed sensors, featuring smart meters and global positioning systems, are continuously sending back power-related data from all facets of the grid. Advances in information and communication technologies (ICT) such as 5G have also ensured the timely transmission of these high-resolution data streams back to stakeholders. Big data analytics, attributable to the emergence of such massive data streams, are becoming vastly popular within the past decades. They aim at constructing data-driven models of the physical grid, which help stakeholders establish an informed decision that maximizes their benefits. For example, [1] recently constructed a comprehensive model of the U.S. power grid, based on the open-source smart grid profiles collected across the Internet, to investigate carbon emissions by 2030. State-of-the-art machine learning models, including deep learning, reinforcement learning and generative networks, are also intensively explored to forecast load and renewable profiles [2], address grid disturbances [3] and defend against false injection attacks [4]."

            "The 21st century has witnessed an increasingly digitalized and intelligent power grid. The widely distributed sensors, featuring smart meters and global positioning systems, are continuously sending back power-related data from all facets of the grid. Advances in information and communication technologies (ICT) such as 5G have also ensured the timely transmission of these high-resolution data streams back to stakeholders. Big data analytics, attributable to the emergence of such massive data streams, are becoming vastly popular within the past decades. They aim at constructing data-driven models of the physical grid, which help stakeholders establish an informed decision that maximizes their benefits. For example, [1] recently constructed a comprehensive model of the U.S. power grid, based on the open-source smart grid profiles collected across the Internet, to investigate carbon emissions by 2030. State-of-the-art machine learning models, including deep learning, reinforcement learning and generative networks, are also intensively explored to forecast load and renewable profiles [2], address grid disturbances [3] and defend against false injection attacks [4]."

            "The 21st century has witnessed an increasingly digitalized and intelligent power grid. The widely distributed sensors, featuring smart meters and global positioning systems, are continuously sending back power-related data from all facets of the grid. Advances in information and communication technologies (ICT) such as 5G have also ensured the timely transmission of these high-resolution data streams back to stakeholders. Big data analytics, attributable to the emergence of such massive data streams, are becoming vastly popular within the past decades. They aim at constructing data-driven models of the physical grid, which help stakeholders establish an informed decision that maximizes their benefits. For example, [1] recently constructed a comprehensive model of the U.S. power grid, based on the open-source smart grid profiles collected across the Internet, to investigate carbon emissions by 2030. State-of-the-art machine learning models, including deep learning, reinforcement learning and generative networks, are also intensively explored to forecast load and renewable profiles [2], address grid disturbances [3] and defend against false injection attacks [4]."
