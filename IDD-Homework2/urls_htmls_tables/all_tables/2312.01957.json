            "Building on the idea of RLHF as Bayesian inference (Korbak et\u00a0al., 2022), we propose a unique interpretation of RLAIF in the same light and introduce a new implementation called distilled Self-Critique (dSC). This approach refines LLM responses through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler, and utilizing only synthetic data. Unlike the Self-Refine method (Madaan et\u00a0al., 2023), dSC incorporates a likelihood model to un-bias the samples and includes a self-distillation phase. We also differentiate our method from ReST (Gulcehre et\u00a0al., 2023), which lacks our explicit critique and revision steps. Key features of each approach are compared in our summary Table 2 and the functionality of dSC is illustrated in the schematic Figure 1."

Review: I recently had the misfortune of watching the film N&#776;o Country for Old Men,&#776; and I must say, it was an utterly disappointing experience. The storyline felt disjointed and confusing, making it almost impossible to follow. Even though the plot twists were meant to keep the audience on their toes, they felt forced and contrived instead of being natural and organic. The acting in this film left much to be desired. The characters lacked depth and development, leaving little room for emotional connection or investment from the viewers. Although there was a stellar cast including Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem, and Josh Brolin, their performances seemed stiff and unconvincing. Furthermore, the cinematography left me underwhelmed. The film&#8217;s visual style felt drab and uninteresting, failing to capture the essence of its Texas setting. Additionally, the editing was choppy and ineffective, leaving many scenes feeling disjointed and frustrating to watch. Moreover, I found the pacing to be problematic. The film&#8217;s slow burn approach felt excessively long, causing it to drag on with little payoff for the audience. The tension was supposed to build up throughout the movie, but instead it seemed to plummet, leaving me disinterested and bored by the end. The music score also left much to be desired. It felt out of place and inconsistent with the mood and tone of the film.</span>\n</span>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr id=\"A2.T6.1.6.5\" class=\"ltx_tr\">\n<td id=\"A2.T6.1.6.5.1\" class=\"ltx_td\"></td>\n<td id=\"A2.T6.1.6.5.2\" class=\"ltx_td ltx_align_left\">Stable-Beluga 7B + SC</td>\n<td id=\"A2.T6.1.6.5.3\" class=\"ltx_td ltx_align_left\">\n<span id=\"A2.T6.1.6.5.3.1\" class=\"ltx_inline-block ltx_align_top\">\n<span id=\"A2.T6.1.6.5.3.1.1\" class=\"ltx_p\" style=\"width:199.2pt;\">Title: An Engrossing Thriller That Leaves You in Suspense.

The movie&#8217;s pacing is perfectly balanced, allowing intense action sequences to coexist with contemplative moments that give the audience time to breathe. The film boasts an outstanding cast including Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem, and Josh Brolin, who each deliver captivating performances that bring depth to their characters. The cinematography is stunning, showcasing the desolate beauty of West Texas while highlighting the emotional turmoil at the heart of the story. The film&#8217;s score by Carter Burwell adds both tension and atmosphere, perfectly complementing the unfolding events on screen. Additionally, N&#776;o Country for Old Men&#235;xplores the complexities of morality and human nature, forcing viewers to confront difficult questions about life, death, and the consequences of one&#8217;s actions.

            "Avoiding harmful behaviors. We aim to improve safety by avoiding harmful content from the LLM, using a collection of adversarial prompts from Harmful Behaviors (Zou et\u00a0al., 2023). For the RM, we use the gpt-3.5-turbo model to classify the responses into unsafe (0) or safe (1). Table 1 shows this safety score over a test set of prompts for different baselines and ablations: the original model; the model plus a system prompt that encourages safety; the model with outputs refined with self-critique (SC); and a model distilled with dSC over a different training set of prompts (with and without the acceptance step). The distilled variant with acceptance steps achieves the highest safety scores for the two model sizes evaluated."
