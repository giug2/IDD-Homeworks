From the table, the existing countermeasures are designed to prevent the global model from aggregating poisoned model updates, by way of discarding or devaluing part of the received model updates.\nFor example, in KRUM, only the most representative model update can be used to update the global model, while the others are all dropped.\nIn this sense, the existing countermeasures under-utilize model updates."
