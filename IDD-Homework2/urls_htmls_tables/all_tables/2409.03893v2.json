            "The four algorithmic fairness metrics chosen for the study were Demographic Parity, Equal Accuracy, Equal Odds, and Positive Predictive Value <cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep\">(Rajkomar et&#160;al<span class=\"ltx_text\">.</span>, <a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2409.03893v2#bib.bib9\" title=\"\">2018</a>)</cite>. Each of these metrics alleviates at least one condition and deteriorates one other. Demographic Parity is achieved if two populations are equally represented in the outcome, independent of the size of the populations - in this scenario, demographic parity is achieved if patients from the high-income and low-income groups are equally represented in the outcome. Equal Accuracy, also referred to as accuracy parity, requires the model to perform equivalently (in terms of, e.g., prediction accuracy) within the populations in order to attain equal accuracy. Equalized odds refers to the notion of two equivalently qualified data points in two populations having the same probability of being selected, independent of population sizes. Finally, Positive predictive value, or precision, specifies the fraction of predicted values being correct. The specific formulations used in the high-stake scenario in survey are shown in \n(Rajkomar et\u00a0al., 2018). Each of these metrics alleviates at least one condition and deteriorates one other.

The specific formulations used in the high-stake scenario in survey are shown in Table\u00a01. Similar descriptions were also presented for the low-stake scenario, although worded so as to reflect the low-stake of that scenario.",
            "The rationale behind the questions corresponding to different conditions (high-stake/low-stake) is to see if a difference in preference for a particular option can be detected depending on the context. As seen in Table\u00a01, an additional option (E) was included, for the survey participants to be able to indicate that they do not fully understand the four model options (whether individually or the difference between them).",
            "Fig.\u00a01(a) and Fig.\u00a01(b) show an overview of participants\u2019 responses to Scenario 1 and 2. Each option (i.e., answers A through E as presented in Table\u00a01) is represented. There is a clear preference for specific algorithmic fairness metrics in each case: Option C (Equalized Odds) was preferred for Scenario 1 (34% of responses), and Option B (Equal Accuracy) for Scenario 2 (35% of responses). In other words, the most common response among participants was the Equal Odds metric in a high-stake scenario and the Equal Accuracy metric in a low-stake one."
