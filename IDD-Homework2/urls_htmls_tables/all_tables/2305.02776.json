            "Clients’ Average Performance.\nWe first examine the overall performance by evaluating the accuracy on local test set of each client, and averaging the results of all clients with weights proportional to their local dataset sizes.\nThe detailed overall performance is shown in Table 1,\nwhere s′¯¯superscript𝑠′\\bar{s^{\\prime}} indicates the average of finally achieved sparsity across all clients (our block-wise operation may lead to s′¯≤s¯superscript𝑠′𝑠\\bar{s^{\\prime}}\\leq s).\nWe can see that pFedGate achieves better accuracy (averaged 3.1% to 4.53% accuracy improvements) and smaller sparsity even with s𝑠s=0.30.30.3 at the same time. Compared with FedEM, the baseline with best accuracy, pFedGate doesn’t have the heavy storage burden, since FedEM needs to store multiple (3) global models in the client. These observations demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.\nNote that compared to the SOTA efficient method HeteroFL, our method achieves better accuracy while with smaller sparsity (0.25 v.s. 0.55).\nWhen s𝑠s=1, we achieve the best performance without sparsity constraints, verifying that the batch-level block-wise adaptation has a strong ability to achieve personalization.\nWhen s<𝑠absents<1, we still gain comparable performance with s𝑠s=1, providing evidence that there exist well-performed sparse models and they can be effectively learned by our approach.",

The results on the CIFAR-10 dataset with different batch sizes are listed in Table 2.\nWe can see that pFedGate can effectively improve the training efficiency and memory cost, where the results are averaged by the number of trained data batches.\nFor example, when s𝑠s=0.3 and b​z𝑏𝑧bz=128, pFedGate uses 66% peak memory and 72% training time compared with FedAvg, meanwhile having 5.32% A​c​c¯¯𝐴𝑐𝑐\\overline{Acc} and 4.17% \n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\nAcc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\nAcc\n\n\\mathchoice{\\mathop{\\vbox{\\halign{#\\cr\\kern 0.80002pt$\\hss\\leavevmode\\resizebox{9.69318pt}{3.8889pt}{\\rotatebox[origin={c}]{90.0}{(}}\\hss$\\crcr\\nointerlineskip\\cr$\\hss\\displaystyle Acc\\hss$\\crcr}}}\\limits}{\\mathop{\\vbox{\\halign{#\\cr\\kern 0.80002pt$\\hss\\leavevmode\\resizebox{9.69318pt}{3.8889pt}{\\rotatebox[origin={c}]{90.0}{(}}\\hss$\\crcr\\nointerlineskip\\cr$\\hss\\textstyle Acc\\hss$\\crcr}}}\\limits}{\\mathop{\\vbox{\\halign{#\\cr\\kern 0.80002pt$\\hss\\leavevmode\\resizebox{6.7852pt}{2.72223pt}{\\rotatebox[origin={c}]{90.0}{(}}\\hss$\\crcr\\nointerlineskip\\cr$\\hss\\scriptstyle Acc\\hss$\\crcr}}}\\limits}{\\mathop{\\vbox{\\halign{#\\cr\\kern 0.80002pt$\\hss\\leavevmode\\resizebox{4.84657pt}{1.94444pt}{\\rotatebox[origin={c}]{90.0}{(}}\\hss$\\crcr\\nointerlineskip\\cr$\\hss\\scriptscriptstyle Acc\\hss$\\crcr}}}\\limits} improvements (Table 1).\nWhen compared to FedEM that leverages 3 global models, the efficiency is more significantly improved (66% M​e​m𝑀𝑒𝑚Mem and 28% t𝑡t) with superior accuracy (1.22% A​c​c¯¯𝐴𝑐𝑐\\overline{Acc} and 1.51% \n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\nAcc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\nAcc\n\n\\mathchoice{\\mathop{\\vbox{\\halign{#\\cr\\kern 0.80002pt$\\hss\\leavevmode\\resizebox{9.69318pt}{3.8889pt}{\\rotatebox[origin={c}]{90.0}{(}}\\hss$\\crcr\\nointerlineskip\\cr$\\hss\\displaystyle Acc\\hss$\\crcr}}}\\limits}{\\mathop{\\vbox{\\halign{#\\cr\\kern 0.80002pt$\\hss\\leavevmode\\resizebox{9.69318pt}{3.8889pt}{\\rotatebox[origin={c}]{90.0}{(}}\\hss$\\crcr\\nointerlineskip\\cr$\\hss\\textstyle Acc\\hss$\\crcr}}}\\limits}{\\mathop{\\vbox{\\halign{#\\cr\\kern 0.80002pt$\\hss\\leavevmode\\resizebox{6.7852pt}{2.72223pt}{\\rotatebox[origin={c}]{90.0}{(}}\\hss$\\crcr\\nointerlineskip\\cr$\\hss\\scriptstyle Acc\\hss$\\crcr}}}\\limits}{\\mathop{\\vbox{\\halign{#\\cr\\kern 0.80002pt$\\hss\\leavevmode\\resizebox{4.84657pt}{1.94444pt}{\\rotatebox[origin={c}]{90.0}{(}}\\hss$\\crcr\\nointerlineskip\\cr$\\hss\\scriptscriptstyle Acc\\hss$\\crcr}}}\\limits} improvements).",
            "We have seen our method can consistently and simultaneously improve the efficiency and model accuracy as Table 1 shows.\nOne can arise such a natural question: when combined with other efficiency improvement techniques such as client sampling, is pFedGate still effective?\nHere we run experiments by uniformly sampling 20% clients without replacement at each round, and summarize the results in Table 3.\nIt is observed that compared with baselines having about 1.45% ∼similar-to\\sim 3.56% performance drop, our method still achieves strong and comparable performance to the non-sampled case, verifying the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method again.",
            "There are FL works considered sparsity, FedDST (Bibikar et al., 2022) and ZeroFL (Qiu et al., 2022).\nHowever, we are different from them in several aspects:\nFirst, from the view of the studied problem, both of these two works focus on non-personalized FL that finds a single global model to perform well on all clients, while we consider the personalized case to learn client-wise models.\nSecond, both of them don’t provide any theoretical analyses for generalization or convergence, while pFedGate performs well with theoretical guarantees in terms of both generalization and convergence.\nThird, from the view of methodology, they are based on element-wise unstructured sparsity while ours is based on block-wise structured sparsity, which is easier to gain efficiency benefits in extended implementations. Finally, from the experimental results, we can see that FedDST works in sparsity with 0.5 or 0.8 (Figure 3 in their paper) while ours works in even s𝑠s=0.1. Another method ZeroFL reported the results of sparsity 0.1 on CIFAR10 and gained 0.42% accuracy improvement compared to vanilla FedAvg (their Table 1, NIID column), while we gained  3.02% improvement over FedAvg with sparsity 0.1 (our Table 1).",
            "Global v.s. Local Models. In Section 7.6, we vary the sparsity factor s𝑠s from 1 to 0.1 to examine the accuracy of pFedGate.\nHere we further compare the accuracy of both the local (personalized) models and the global (shared) model.\nWe firstly directly examined the accuracy of the global model for the same number of FL rounds when the local model achieved the best performance, and find that the accuracy of the global model can be very bad as in the proposed pFedGate method, the global model does not receive a direct correction signal for the ground truth (but rather via a sparse adaptation).\nWe thus train the global model with one more local epoch, then aggregate the trained one and evaluate it. The results on EMNIST dataset are listed in Table 10.",
            "Communication Frequency and Data Distribution.\nIn addition, to investigate the effect of s𝑠s w.r.t. FL characteristics, we (1) change the local update steps (the smaller the number of steps, the more frequently the Federation updates) and (2) change the Dirichlet factor to simulate different Non-IID degrees (the smaller the α𝛼\\alpha, the higher the heterogeneity of the data). The results on EMNIST with different local update steps and results on CIFAR-10 with different α𝛼\\alphas are listed in Table 11 and Table 12 respectively.",
            "We gain sparse local models in the proposed framework via learning personalized gating layers and predicting sparse gated weights for model sub-blocks.\nAs introduced in Section 5.2, we propose a simple and general split manner that chunks the model parameters into B𝐵B equal-sized sub-blocks, where the split factor B𝐵B provides flexible splitting granularity.\nHere we study the sparsification technique proposed in our method by varying the split factor B𝐵B and comparing it with a SOTA PFL method FedMask (Li et al., 2021a), that adopts binary masks to compress the parameters of models’ last layers. The results are shown in Table 13, where we examine the FL accuracy by setting B=[2,5,10]𝐵2510B=[2,5,10] and s=[0.3,0.5]𝑠0.30.5s=[0.3,0.5].",
            "From Table 13 we have the following observations:\nOur method achieves better performance than FedMask in various sparsity settings. Besides, when increasing the sparsity (s=0.5𝑠0.5s=0.5 to s=0.3𝑠0.3s=0.3), our method with B=5𝐵5B=5 still achieves good or even better performance (the accuracy change is +0.248 on average) while FedMask gains large performance drops (the accuracy change is -1.543 on average). These results verify the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive sparse weights prediction again.\nNote that FedMask freezes the local models during the whole FL process and only learns the binary masks for the last several layers of the models. Instead, we train both the local models and the personalized gating layers, which generate continuous gated weights to mask some sub-blocks and scale the weights of other sub-blocks, leading to high capacities for the learnable personalized models.\nWith a smaller sparsity hyper-parameter value, the size of the model’s hypothesis space searched by FedMask (depicted by only the masks for the last several layers) is much smaller than the one of pFedGate (depicted by both the whole model and the gating weights for all the sub-blocks)."

            "We have seen our method can consistently and simultaneously improve the efficiency and model accuracy as Table 1 shows.\nOne can arise such a natural question: when combined with other efficiency improvement techniques such as client sampling, is pFedGate still effective?\nHere we run experiments by uniformly sampling 20% clients without replacement at each round, and summarize the results in Table 3.\nIt is observed that compared with baselines having about 1.45% ∼similar-to\\sim 3.56% performance drop, our method still achieves strong and comparable performance to the non-sampled case, verifying the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method again.",
            "Choices of Gating Layer.\nTo gain further insight into our method, we ablate the gating layer w.r.t. its switchable norm layer (pre-norm) and batch norm layer (post-norm) within the sandwich structure and the sigmoid activation that bounds the gated weights.\nWe also change the batch-wise adaption into client-wise manner by feeding the input feature mean-pooled over all local training data samples of each client.\nWe show the results in Table 4 with s𝑠s=0.50.50.5.",
            "We find that the two normalization layers improve the convergence speed.\nBesides, pre-norm has a larger impact on performance than post-norm since it helps to handle the heterogeneous feature distribution.\nThe sigmoid significantly impacts both the convergence and accuracy, showing the effectiveness of gated weights bounding operation, which restricts the dissimilarity level between the personalized model and global model, and in turn helps to learn a global model suitable for different clients.\nCompared to batch-level manner, although client-wise adaption achieves a faster training, it pays cost of significant accuracy drop due to the coarser-grained modeling of conditional distribution of local data and smaller parameter space could be explored under sparsity constraints.\nIn a nutshell, the ablation results verify effectiveness and necessity of our choices in gating layer.",
            "We now examine the efficiency of pFedGate described in Algorithm 1 in terms of computation, communication, and storage costs.\nTable 5 summarizes the costs for pFedGate and competitors including FedAvg and two SOTA personalized FL methods, where the training and inference costs on clients are considered for each training batch (or each sample when the batch size is 1), and the communication cost is considered for each FL round.\nWe also mark some specific example values when taking the default hyper-parameters of different methods in Table 5.\nFor comparison simplicity, here we assume that for the computation costs, the inference and back-propagation times are proportional to the model size.\nWe hide both constants and polylogarithmic factors dependent on the specific model architectures in 𝒪​(⋅)𝒪⋅\\mathcal{O}(\\cdot), since we compare these methods with the same model architectures and the same trained data samples.\nAs for communication and storage, 𝒪​(⋅)𝒪⋅\\mathcal{O}(\\cdot) hides constants and lower-order factors dependent on specific implementations such as platforms, storage, and communication protocols.",
            "Storage.\n(1) For the peak memory cost on clients, note that FL requires training on client-side, in addition to the model parameters, the memory cost in FL training process also contains the intermediate tensors in both the forward and the backward propagation phases, whose size depends on the model architecture, the shape of the inputs, and the specific implementation (we abstract this factor as r,r′,r′′𝑟superscript𝑟′superscript𝑟′′r,r^{\\prime},r^{\\prime\\prime} for FedAvg, pFedHN and pFedGate respectively in Table 5). Thus once the model-adaption of pFedGate is completed, the intermediate tensor involved in the forward and backward processes through the sparse model is correspondingly smaller based on block sparsity, allowing us to get a lower peak training memory than compared methods (empirical results are in Section 7.4).\n(2) For the disk storage, compared FedAvg, the introduced additional storage overhead of pFedGate is very small as the gating layer structure has a simple and small structure, whose shape is about the multiplication of the dimension of the input feature and the number of the total sub-blocks. For example, the size of gating layer dϕisubscript𝑑subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖d_{\\phi_{i}} is only 6.3% of the original model for the CNN model used on CIFAR-10. We would like to point out that pFedGate actually has great potential for further storage savings for multi-task applications. Considering that if we use one dense original model but learn E𝐸E distinct gating layers for different E𝐸E\ndownstream tasks on a client, the storage cost will be\nd+T∗dϕi𝑑𝑇subscript𝑑subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖d+T*d_{\\phi_{i}}, which has a much smaller model storage cost than saving multiple distinct local models.\nIt is promising to extend the current batch-level adaptation to task-level adaptation to further reduce the storage cost, and we leave it as future work.",
            "Cross-methods Comparison. From Table 5 we can see that pFedGate achieves better efficiency than FedAvg in training, inference, and uploading with negligible additional storage cost on clients (as marked in red).\nBy contrast, to achieve good personalization, FedEM introduces more than one global model and pays larger costs in training, communication, and storage (as marked in blue).\nAnd pFedHN learns client-wise embedding in the server, which may lead to a single-point bottleneck for cross-device settings and potentially disclosing personal information.\nTo further verify the analysis, we present empirical supports in Section 7.4.",
            "FedPNAS (Minh & Carl, 2021) leverages neural architecture search (NAS) to search suitable sub-networks for clients, and FedMN (Tianchun et al., 2022) proposes to use routing-hypernetwork to select personalized sub-blocks.\nFor the FedPNAS, we differ from it in the target and studied problem. FedPNAS mainly focuses on improving the personalization performance with sufficient hardware resources. For example, they adopt 5 clients in their experiments that usually correspond to the cross-silo case. While pFedGate focuses on the cross-device setting, where the clients’ resources are usually very limited.\nCompared with FedMN, the performance of pFedGate is theoretically guaranteed for both generalization and convergence. While FedMN doesn’t provide any theoretical analyses for generalization or convergence. Besides, the proposed pFedGate method adopts a much larger hypotheses space than FedMN. In FedMN, each modular is either connected or dropped. While pFedGate doesn’t only decide the connections of the network (connected or dropped), but also scales the weights of the remained blocks simultaneously to improve the personalized performance.",
            "There are FL works considered sparsity, FedDST (Bibikar et al., 2022) and ZeroFL (Qiu et al., 2022).\nHowever, we are different from them in several aspects:\nFirst, from the view of the studied problem, both of these two works focus on non-personalized FL that finds a single global model to perform well on all clients, while we consider the personalized case to learn client-wise models.\nSecond, both of them don’t provide any theoretical analyses for generalization or convergence, while pFedGate performs well with theoretical guarantees in terms of both generalization and convergence.\nThird, from the view of methodology, they are based on element-wise unstructured sparsity while ours is based on block-wise structured sparsity, which is easier to gain efficiency benefits in extended implementations. Finally, from the experimental results, we can see that FedDST works in sparsity with 0.5 or 0.8 (Figure 3 in their paper) while ours works in even s𝑠s=0.1. Another method ZeroFL reported the results of sparsity 0.1 on CIFAR10 and gained 0.42% accuracy improvement compared to vanilla FedAvg (their Table 1, NIID column), while we gained  3.02% improvement over FedAvg with sparsity 0.1 (our Table 1).",
            "We also compared meta-learning-based PFL methods including Per-FedAvg (Fallah et al., 2020) and pFedMe (Dinh et al., 2020b). Per-FedAvg leverages model agnostic meta-learning to enable fast local personalized training. However, it requires computationally expensive second-order gradients, which challenges real-world applications, especially with limited system resources.\npFedMe improves Per-FedAvg with faster convergence and smaller computation complexity.\nWe empirically show that our methods can achieve better performance than theirs in Table 6.",
            "Besides, knowledge distillation-based methods can also deal with hardware heterogeneity by allowing different local models to use different architectures.\nHowever, many existing KD-based FL/PFL works rely on some common reference object shared among clients, to enable knowledge alignment between the teacher and student models.\nFor example, works (Li & Wang, 2019; Zhu et al., 2021) introduce additional public data for all clients and perform FL with the help of the model logits on the public data. It’s worth noticing that such additional common references may not always be available in some scenarios.\nFurther, we conduct empirical comparisons to a known KD-based FL method, FedMD (Li & Wang, 2019). We list the results on FEMNIST and CIFAR-10 in Table 6, where “FedMD, Far-Trans” indicates a far-transfer case by adopting the CIFAR-10 as the public dataset for FEMNIST experiment, and adopting the FEMNIST as the public dataset for CIFAR-10 experiment.\nThe “FedMD, Near-Trans” indicates a near-transfer case by adopting the EMNIST as the public dataset for FEMNIST experiment, and adopting the CIFAR-100 as the public dataset for CIFAR-10 experiment.\nWe find that pFedGate still shows superiority in terms of the average/bottom accuracy, and robustness when we vary the sparsity\nfor pFedGate and vary the public dataset for FedMD.",

In Section 7.6, we vary the sparsity factor s𝑠s from 1 to 0.1 to examine the accuracy of pFedGate.\nHere we further compare the accuracy of both the local (personalized) models and the global (shared) model.\nWe firstly directly examined the accuracy of the global model for the same number of FL rounds when the local model achieved the best performance, and find that the accuracy of the global model can be very bad as in the proposed pFedGate method, the global model does not receive a direct correction signal for the ground truth (but rather via a sparse adaptation).\nWe thus train the global model with one more local epoch, then aggregate the trained one and evaluate it. The results on EMNIST dataset are listed in Table 10.",

            "We gain sparse local models in the proposed framework via learning personalized gating layers and predicting sparse gated weights for model sub-blocks.\nAs introduced in Section 5.2, we propose a simple and general split manner that chunks the model parameters into B𝐵B equal-sized sub-blocks, where the split factor B𝐵B provides flexible splitting granularity.\nHere we study the sparsification technique proposed in our method by varying the split factor B𝐵B and comparing it with a SOTA PFL method FedMask (Li et al., 2021a), that adopts binary masks to compress the parameters of models’ last layers. The results are shown in Table 13, where we examine the FL accuracy by setting B=[2,5,10]𝐵2510B=[2,5,10] and s=[0.3,0.5]𝑠0.30.5s=[0.3,0.5].",

Besides, when increasing the sparsity (s=0.5𝑠0.5s=0.5 to s=0.3𝑠0.3s=0.3), our method with B=5𝐵5B=5 still achieves good or even better performance (the accuracy change is +0.248 on average) while FedMask gains large performance drops (the accuracy change is -1.543 on average). These results verify the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive sparse weights prediction again.\nNote that FedMask freezes the local models during the whole FL process and only learns the binary masks for the last several layers of the models. Instead, we train both the local models and the personalized gating layers, which generate continuous gated weights to mask some sub-blocks and scale the weights of other sub-blocks, leading to high capacities for the learnable personalized models.\nWith a smaller sparsity hyper-parameter value, the size of the model’s hypothesis space searched by FedMask (depicted by only the masks for the last several layers) is much smaller than the one of pFedGate (depicted by both the whole model and the gating weights for all the sub-blocks)."

            "Clients’ Average Performance.\nWe first examine the overall performance by evaluating the accuracy on local test set of each client, and averaging the results of all clients with weights proportional to their local dataset sizes.\nThe detailed overall performance is shown in Table 1,\nwhere s′¯¯superscript𝑠′\\bar{s^{\\prime}} indicates the average of finally achieved sparsity across all clients (our block-wise operation may lead to s′¯≤s¯superscript𝑠′𝑠\\bar{s^{\\prime}}\\leq s).\nWe can see that pFedGate achieves better accuracy (averaged 3.1% to 4.53% accuracy improvements) and smaller sparsity even with s𝑠s=0.30.30.3 at the same time. Compared with FedEM, the baseline with best accuracy, pFedGate doesn’t have the heavy storage burden, since FedEM needs to store multiple (3) global models in the client. These observations demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.\nNote that compared to the SOTA efficient method HeteroFL, our method achieves better accuracy while with smaller sparsity (0.25 v.s. 0.55).\nWhen s𝑠s=1, we achieve the best performance without sparsity constraints, verifying that the batch-level block-wise adaptation has a strong ability to achieve personalization.\nWhen s<𝑠absents<1, we still gain comparable performance with s𝑠s=1, providing evidence that there exist well-performed sparse models and they can be effectively learned by our approach.",

            "We have seen our method can consistently and simultaneously improve the efficiency and model accuracy as Table 1 shows.\nOne can arise such a natural question: when combined with other efficiency improvement techniques such as client sampling, is pFedGate still effective?\nHere we run experiments by uniformly sampling 20% clients without replacement at each round, and summarize the results in Table 3.\nIt is observed that compared with baselines having about 1.45% ∼similar-to\\sim 3.56% performance drop, our method still achieves strong and comparable performance to the non-sampled case, verifying the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method again.",
            "Choices of Gating Layer.\nTo gain further insight into our method, we ablate the gating layer w.r.t. its switchable norm layer (pre-norm) and batch norm layer (post-norm) within the sandwich structure and the sigmoid activation that bounds the gated weights.\nWe also change the batch-wise adaption into client-wise manner by feeding the input feature mean-pooled over all local training data samples of each client.\nWe show the results in Table 4 with s𝑠s=0.50.50.5.",
            "We find that the two normalization layers improve the convergence speed.\nBesides, pre-norm has a larger impact on performance than post-norm since it helps to handle the heterogeneous feature distribution.\nThe sigmoid significantly impacts both the convergence and accuracy, showing the effectiveness of gated weights bounding operation, which restricts the dissimilarity level between the personalized model and global model, and in turn helps to learn a global model suitable for different clients.\nCompared to batch-level manner, although client-wise adaption achieves a faster training, it pays cost of significant accuracy drop due to the coarser-grained modeling of conditional distribution of local data and smaller parameter space could be explored under sparsity constraints.\nIn a nutshell, the ablation results verify effectiveness and necessity of our choices in gating layer.",
            "We now examine the efficiency of pFedGate described in Algorithm 1 in terms of computation, communication, and storage costs.\nTable 5 summarizes the costs for pFedGate and competitors including FedAvg and two SOTA personalized FL methods, where the training and inference costs on clients are considered for each training batch (or each sample when the batch size is 1), and the communication cost is considered for each FL round.\nWe also mark some specific example values when taking the default hyper-parameters of different methods in Table 5.\nFor comparison simplicity, here we assume that for the computation costs, the inference and back-propagation times are proportional to the model size.\nWe hide both constants and polylogarithmic factors dependent on the specific model architectures in 𝒪​(⋅)𝒪⋅\\mathcal{O}(\\cdot), since we compare these methods with the same model architectures and the same trained data samples.\nAs for communication and storage, 𝒪​(⋅)𝒪⋅\\mathcal{O}(\\cdot) hides constants and lower-order factors dependent on specific implementations such as platforms, storage, and communication protocols.",
            "Storage.\n(1) For the peak memory cost on clients, note that FL requires training on client-side, in addition to the model parameters, the memory cost in FL training process also contains the intermediate tensors in both the forward and the backward propagation phases, whose size depends on the model architecture, the shape of the inputs, and the specific implementation (we abstract this factor as r,r′,r′′𝑟superscript𝑟′superscript𝑟′′r,r^{\\prime},r^{\\prime\\prime} for FedAvg, pFedHN and pFedGate respectively in Table 5). Thus once the model-adaption of pFedGate is completed, the intermediate tensor involved in the forward and backward processes through the sparse model is correspondingly smaller based on block sparsity, allowing us to get a lower peak training memory than compared methods (empirical results are in Section 7.4).\n(2) For the disk storage, compared FedAvg, the introduced additional storage overhead of pFedGate is very small as the gating layer structure has a simple and small structure, whose shape is about the multiplication of the dimension of the input feature and the number of the total sub-blocks. For example, the size of gating layer dϕisubscript𝑑subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖d_{\\phi_{i}} is only 6.3% of the original model for the CNN model used on CIFAR-10. We would like to point out that pFedGate actually has great potential for further storage savings for multi-task applications. Considering that if we use one dense original model but learn E𝐸E distinct gating layers for different E𝐸E\ndownstream tasks on a client, the storage cost will be\nd+T∗dϕi𝑑𝑇subscript𝑑subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖d+T*d_{\\phi_{i}}, which has a much smaller model storage cost than saving multiple distinct local models.\nIt is promising to extend the current batch-level adaptation to task-level adaptation to further reduce the storage cost, and we leave it as future work.",
            "Cross-methods Comparison. From Table 5 we can see that pFedGate achieves better efficiency than FedAvg in training, inference, and uploading with negligible additional storage cost on clients (as marked in red).\nBy contrast, to achieve good personalization, FedEM introduces more than one global model and pays larger costs in training, communication, and storage (as marked in blue).\nAnd pFedHN learns client-wise embedding in the server, which may lead to a single-point bottleneck for cross-device settings and potentially disclosing personal information.\nTo further verify the analysis, we present empirical supports in Section 7.4.",
            "FedPNAS (Minh & Carl, 2021) leverages neural architecture search (NAS) to search suitable sub-networks for clients, and FedMN (Tianchun et al., 2022) proposes to use routing-hypernetwork to select personalized sub-blocks.\nFor the FedPNAS, we differ from it in the target and studied problem. FedPNAS mainly focuses on improving the personalization performance with sufficient hardware resources. For example, they adopt 5 clients in their experiments that usually correspond to the cross-silo case. While pFedGate focuses on the cross-device setting, where the clients’ resources are usually very limited.\nCompared with FedMN, the performance of pFedGate is theoretically guaranteed for both generalization and convergence. While FedMN doesn’t provide any theoretical analyses for generalization or convergence. Besides, the proposed pFedGate method adopts a much larger hypotheses space than FedMN. In FedMN, each modular is either connected or dropped. While pFedGate doesn’t only decide the connections of the network (connected or dropped), but also scales the weights of the remained blocks simultaneously to improve the personalized performance.",
            "There are FL works considered sparsity, FedDST (Bibikar et al., 2022) and ZeroFL (Qiu et al., 2022).\nHowever, we are different from them in several aspects:\nFirst, from the view of the studied problem, both of these two works focus on non-personalized FL that finds a single global model to perform well on all clients, while we consider the personalized case to learn client-wise models.\nSecond, both of them don’t provide any theoretical analyses for generalization or convergence, while pFedGate performs well with theoretical guarantees in terms of both generalization and convergence.\nThird, from the view of methodology, they are based on element-wise unstructured sparsity while ours is based on block-wise structured sparsity, which is easier to gain efficiency benefits in extended implementations. Finally, from the experimental results, we can see that FedDST works in sparsity with 0.5 or 0.8 (Figure 3 in their paper) while ours works in even s𝑠s=0.1. Another method ZeroFL reported the results of sparsity 0.1 on CIFAR10 and gained 0.42% accuracy improvement compared to vanilla FedAvg (their Table 1, NIID column), while we gained  3.02% improvement over FedAvg with sparsity 0.1 (our Table 1).",
            "We also compared meta-learning-based PFL methods including Per-FedAvg (Fallah et al., 2020) and pFedMe (Dinh et al., 2020b). Per-FedAvg leverages model agnostic meta-learning to enable fast local personalized training. However, it requires computationally expensive second-order gradients, which challenges real-world applications, especially with limited system resources.\npFedMe improves Per-FedAvg with faster convergence and smaller computation complexity.\nWe empirically show that our methods can achieve better performance than theirs in Table 6.",
            "Besides, knowledge distillation-based methods can also deal with hardware heterogeneity by allowing different local models to use different architectures.\nHowever, many existing KD-based FL/PFL works rely on some common reference object shared among clients, to enable knowledge alignment between the teacher and student models.\nFor example, works (Li & Wang, 2019; Zhu et al., 2021) introduce additional public data for all clients and perform FL with the help of the model logits on the public data. It’s worth noticing that such additional common references may not always be available in some scenarios.\nFurther, we conduct empirical comparisons to a known KD-based FL method, FedMD (Li & Wang, 2019). We list the results on FEMNIST and CIFAR-10 in Table 6, where “FedMD, Far-Trans” indicates a far-transfer case by adopting the CIFAR-10 as the public dataset for FEMNIST experiment, and adopting the FEMNIST as the public dataset for CIFAR-10 experiment.\nThe “FedMD, Near-Trans” indicates a near-transfer case by adopting the EMNIST as the public dataset for FEMNIST experiment, and adopting the CIFAR-100 as the public dataset for CIFAR-10 experiment.\nWe find that pFedGate still shows superiority in terms of the average/bottom accuracy, and robustness when we vary the sparsity\nfor pFedGate and vary the public dataset for FedMD.",

The results are shown in Table 13, where we examine the FL accuracy by setting B=[2,5,10]𝐵2510B=[2,5,10] and s=[0.3,0.5]𝑠0.30.5s=[0.3,0.5].",

Besides, when increasing the sparsity (s=0.5𝑠0.5s=0.5 to s=0.3𝑠0.3s=0.3), our method with B=5𝐵5B=5 still achieves good or even better performance (the accuracy change is +0.248 on average) while FedMask gains large performance drops (the accuracy change is -1.543 on average). These results verify the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive sparse weights prediction again.\nNote that FedMask freezes the local models during the whole FL process and only learns the binary masks for the last several layers of the models. Instead, we train both the local models and the personalized gating layers, which generate continuous gated weights to mask some sub-blocks and scale the weights of other sub-blocks, leading to high capacities for the learnable personalized models.\nWith a smaller sparsity hyper-parameter value, the size of the model’s hypothesis space searched by FedMask (depicted by only the masks for the last several layers) is much smaller than the one of pFedGate (depicted by both the whole model and the gating weights for all the sub-blocks)."

            "We find that the two normalization layers improve the convergence speed.\nBesides, pre-norm has a larger impact on performance than post-norm since it helps to handle the heterogeneous feature distribution.\nThe sigmoid significantly impacts both the convergence and accuracy, showing the effectiveness of gated weights bounding operation, which restricts the dissimilarity level between the personalized model and global model, and in turn helps to learn a global model suitable for different clients.\nCompared to batch-level manner, although client-wise adaption achieves a faster training, it pays cost of significant accuracy drop due to the coarser-grained modeling of conditional distribution of local data and smaller parameter space could be explored under sparsity constraints.\nIn a nutshell, the ablation results verify effectiveness and necessity of our choices in gating layer.",
            "We now examine the efficiency of pFedGate described in Algorithm 1 in terms of computation, communication, and storage costs.\nTable 5 summarizes the costs for pFedGate and competitors including FedAvg and two SOTA personalized FL methods, where the training and inference costs on clients are considered for each training batch (or each sample when the batch size is 1), and the communication cost is considered for each FL round.\nWe also mark some specific example values when taking the default hyper-parameters of different methods in Table 5.\nFor comparison simplicity, here we assume that for the computation costs, the inference and back-propagation times are proportional to the model size.\nWe hide both constants and polylogarithmic factors dependent on the specific model architectures in 𝒪​(⋅)𝒪⋅\\mathcal{O}(\\cdot), since we compare these methods with the same model architectures and the same trained data samples.\nAs for communication and storage, 𝒪​(⋅)𝒪⋅\\mathcal{O}(\\cdot) hides constants and lower-order factors dependent on specific implementations such as platforms, storage, and communication protocols.",
            "Storage.\n(1) For the peak memory cost on clients, note that FL requires training on client-side, in addition to the model parameters, the memory cost in FL training process also contains the intermediate tensors in both the forward and the backward propagation phases, whose size depends on the model architecture, the shape of the inputs, and the specific implementation (we abstract this factor as r,r′,r′′𝑟superscript𝑟′superscript𝑟′′r,r^{\\prime},r^{\\prime\\prime} for FedAvg, pFedHN and pFedGate respectively in Table 5). Thus once the model-adaption of pFedGate is completed, the intermediate tensor involved in the forward and backward processes through the sparse model is correspondingly smaller based on block sparsity, allowing us to get a lower peak training memory than compared methods (empirical results are in Section 7.4).\n(2) For the disk storage, compared FedAvg, the introduced additional storage overhead of pFedGate is very small as the gating layer structure has a simple and small structure, whose shape is about the multiplication of the dimension of the input feature and the number of the total sub-blocks. For example, the size of gating layer dϕisubscript𝑑subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖d_{\\phi_{i}} is only 6.3% of the original model for the CNN model used on CIFAR-10. We would like to point out that pFedGate actually has great potential for further storage savings for multi-task applications. Considering that if we use one dense original model but learn E𝐸E distinct gating layers for different E𝐸E\ndownstream tasks on a client, the storage cost will be\nd+T∗dϕi𝑑𝑇subscript𝑑subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖d+T*d_{\\phi_{i}}, which has a much smaller model storage cost than saving multiple distinct local models.\nIt is promising to extend the current batch-level adaptation to task-level adaptation to further reduce the storage cost, and we leave it as future work.",
            "Cross-methods Comparison. From Table 5 we can see that pFedGate achieves better efficiency than FedAvg in training, inference, and uploading with negligible additional storage cost on clients (as marked in red).\nBy contrast, to achieve good personalization, FedEM introduces more than one global model and pays larger costs in training, communication, and storage (as marked in blue).\nAnd pFedHN learns client-wise embedding in the server, which may lead to a single-point bottleneck for cross-device settings and potentially disclosing personal information.\nTo further verify the analysis, we present empirical supports in Section 7.4.",
            "FedPNAS (Minh & Carl, 2021) leverages neural architecture search (NAS) to search suitable sub-networks for clients, and FedMN (Tianchun et al., 2022) proposes to use routing-hypernetwork to select personalized sub-blocks.\nFor the FedPNAS, we differ from it in the target and studied problem. FedPNAS mainly focuses on improving the personalization performance with sufficient hardware resources. For example, they adopt 5 clients in their experiments that usually correspond to the cross-silo case. While pFedGate focuses on the cross-device setting, where the clients’ resources are usually very limited.\nCompared with FedMN, the performance of pFedGate is theoretically guaranteed for both generalization and convergence. While FedMN doesn’t provide any theoretical analyses for generalization or convergence. Besides, the proposed pFedGate method adopts a much larger hypotheses space than FedMN. In FedMN, each modular is either connected or dropped. While pFedGate doesn’t only decide the connections of the network (connected or dropped), but also scales the weights of the remained blocks simultaneously to improve the personalized performance.",
            "There are FL works considered sparsity, FedDST (Bibikar et al., 2022) and ZeroFL (Qiu et al., 2022).\nHowever, we are different from them in several aspects:\nFirst, from the view of the studied problem, both of these two works focus on non-personalized FL that finds a single global model to perform well on all clients, while we consider the personalized case to learn client-wise models.\nSecond, both of them don’t provide any theoretical analyses for generalization or convergence, while pFedGate performs well with theoretical guarantees in terms of both generalization and convergence.\nThird, from the view of methodology, they are based on element-wise unstructured sparsity while ours is based on block-wise structured sparsity, which is easier to gain efficiency benefits in extended implementations. Finally, from the experimental results, we can see that FedDST works in sparsity with 0.5 or 0.8 (Figure 3 in their paper) while ours works in even s𝑠s=0.1. Another method ZeroFL reported the results of sparsity 0.1 on CIFAR10 and gained 0.42% accuracy improvement compared to vanilla FedAvg (their Table 1, NIID column), while we gained  3.02% improvement over FedAvg with sparsity 0.1 (our Table 1).",
            "We also compared meta-learning-based PFL methods including Per-FedAvg (Fallah et al., 2020) and pFedMe (Dinh et al., 2020b). Per-FedAvg leverages model agnostic meta-learning to enable fast local personalized training. However, it requires computationally expensive second-order gradients, which challenges real-world applications, especially with limited system resources.\npFedMe improves Per-FedAvg with faster convergence and smaller computation complexity.\nWe empirically show that our methods can achieve better performance than theirs in Table 6.",
            "Besides, knowledge distillation-based methods can also deal with hardware heterogeneity by allowing different local models to use different architectures.\nHowever, many existing KD-based FL/PFL works rely on some common reference object shared among clients, to enable knowledge alignment between the teacher and student models.\nFor example, works (Li & Wang, 2019; Zhu et al., 2021) introduce additional public data for all clients and perform FL with the help of the model logits on the public data. It’s worth noticing that such additional common references may not always be available in some scenarios.\nFurther, we conduct empirical comparisons to a known KD-based FL method, FedMD (Li & Wang, 2019). We list the results on FEMNIST and CIFAR-10 in Table 6, where “FedMD, Far-Trans” indicates a far-transfer case by adopting the CIFAR-10 as the public dataset for FEMNIST experiment, and adopting the FEMNIST as the public dataset for CIFAR-10 experiment.\nThe “FedMD, Near-Trans” indicates a near-transfer case by adopting the EMNIST as the public dataset for FEMNIST experiment, and adopting the CIFAR-100 as the public dataset for CIFAR-10 experiment.\nWe find that pFedGate still shows superiority in terms of the average/bottom accuracy, and robustness when we vary the sparsity\nfor pFedGate and vary the public dataset for FedMD.",

FL characteristics, we (1) change the local update steps (the smaller the number of steps, the more frequently the Federation updates) and (2) change the Dirichlet factor to simulate different Non-IID degrees (the smaller the α𝛼\\alpha, the higher the heterogeneity of the data). The results on EMNIST with different local update steps and results on CIFAR-10 with different α𝛼\\alphas are listed in Table 11 and Table 12 respectively.",
            "We gain sparse local models in the proposed framework via learning personalized gating layers and predicting sparse gated weights for model sub-blocks.\nAs introduced in Section 5.2, we propose a simple and general split manner that chunks the model parameters into B𝐵B equal-sized sub-blocks, where the split factor B𝐵B provides flexible splitting granularity.\nHere we study the sparsification technique proposed in our method by varying the split factor B𝐵B and comparing it with a SOTA PFL method FedMask (Li et al., 2021a), that adopts binary masks to compress the parameters of models’ last layers. The results are shown in Table 13, where we examine the FL accuracy by setting B=[2,5,10]𝐵2510B=[2,5,10] and s=[0.3,0.5]𝑠0.30.5s=[0.3,0.5].",
            "From Table 13 we have the following observations:\nOur method achieves better performance than FedMask in various sparsity settings. Besides, when increasing the sparsity (s=0.5𝑠0.5s=0.5 to s=0.3𝑠0.3s=0.3), our method with B=5𝐵5B=5 still achieves good or even better performance (the accuracy change is +0.248 on average) while FedMask gains large performance drops (the accuracy change is -1.543 on average). These results verify the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive sparse weights prediction again.\nNote that FedMask freezes the local models during the whole FL process and only learns the binary masks for the last several layers of the models. Instead, we train both the local models and the personalized gating layers, which generate continuous gated weights to mask some sub-blocks and scale the weights of other sub-blocks, leading to high capacities for the learnable personalized models.\nWith a smaller sparsity hyper-parameter value, the size of the model’s hypothesis space searched by FedMask (depicted by only the masks for the last several layers) is much smaller than the one of pFedGate (depicted by both the whole model and the gating weights for all the sub-blocks)."

            "We now examine the efficiency of pFedGate described in Algorithm 1 in terms of computation, communication, and storage costs.\nTable 5 summarizes the costs for pFedGate and competitors including FedAvg and two SOTA personalized FL methods, where the training and inference costs on clients are considered for each training batch (or each sample when the batch size is 1), and the communication cost is considered for each FL round.\nWe also mark some specific example values when taking the default hyper-parameters of different methods in Table 5.\nFor comparison simplicity, here we assume that for the computation costs, the inference and back-propagation times are proportional to the model size.\nWe hide both constants and polylogarithmic factors dependent on the specific model architectures in 𝒪​(⋅)𝒪⋅\\mathcal{O}(\\cdot), since we compare these methods with the same model architectures and the same trained data samples.\nAs for communication and storage, 𝒪​(⋅)𝒪⋅\\mathcal{O}(\\cdot) hides constants and lower-order factors dependent on specific implementations such as platforms, storage, and communication protocols.",
            "Storage.\n(1) For the peak memory cost on clients, note that FL requires training on client-side, in addition to the model parameters, the memory cost in FL training process also contains the intermediate tensors in both the forward and the backward propagation phases, whose size depends on the model architecture, the shape of the inputs, and the specific implementation (we abstract this factor as r,r′,r′′𝑟superscript𝑟′superscript𝑟′′r,r^{\\prime},r^{\\prime\\prime} for FedAvg, pFedHN and pFedGate respectively in Table 5). Thus once the model-adaption of pFedGate is completed, the intermediate tensor involved in the forward and backward processes through the sparse model is correspondingly smaller based on block sparsity, allowing us to get a lower peak training memory than compared methods (empirical results are in Section 7.4).\n(2) For the disk storage, compared FedAvg, the introduced additional storage overhead of pFedGate is very small as the gating layer structure has a simple and small structure, whose shape is about the multiplication of the dimension of the input feature and the number of the total sub-blocks. For example, the size of gating layer dϕisubscript𝑑subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖d_{\\phi_{i}} is only 6.3% of the original model for the CNN model used on CIFAR-10. We would like to point out that pFedGate actually has great potential for further storage savings for multi-task applications. Considering that if we use one dense original model but learn E𝐸E distinct gating layers for different E𝐸E\ndownstream tasks on a client, the storage cost will be\nd+T∗dϕi𝑑𝑇subscript𝑑subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖d+T*d_{\\phi_{i}}, which has a much smaller model storage cost than saving multiple distinct local models.\nIt is promising to extend the current batch-level adaptation to task-level adaptation to further reduce the storage cost, and we leave it as future work.",
            "Cross-methods Comparison. From Table 5 we can see that pFedGate achieves better efficiency than FedAvg in training, inference, and uploading with negligible additional storage cost on clients (as marked in red).\nBy contrast, to achieve good personalization, FedEM introduces more than one global model and pays larger costs in training, communication, and storage (as marked in blue).\nAnd pFedHN learns client-wise embedding in the server, which may lead to a single-point bottleneck for cross-device settings and potentially disclosing personal information.\nTo further verify the analysis, we present empirical supports in Section 7.4."

            "We also compared meta-learning-based PFL methods including Per-FedAvg (Fallah et al., 2020) and pFedMe (Dinh et al., 2020b). Per-FedAvg leverages model agnostic meta-learning to enable fast local personalized training. However, it requires computationally expensive second-order gradients, which challenges real-world applications, especially with limited system resources.\npFedMe improves Per-FedAvg with faster convergence and smaller computation complexity.\nWe empirically show that our methods can achieve better performance than theirs in Table 6.",
            "Besides, knowledge distillation-based methods can also deal with hardware heterogeneity by allowing different local models to use different architectures.\nHowever, many existing KD-based FL/PFL works rely on some common reference object shared among clients, to enable knowledge alignment between the teacher and student models.\nFor example, works (Li & Wang, 2019; Zhu et al., 2021) introduce additional public data for all clients and perform FL with the help of the model logits on the public data. It’s worth noticing that such additional common references may not always be available in some scenarios.\nFurther, we conduct empirical comparisons to a known KD-based FL method, FedMD (Li & Wang, 2019). We list the results on FEMNIST and CIFAR-10 in Table 6, where “FedMD, Far-Trans” indicates a far-transfer case by adopting the CIFAR-10 as the public dataset for FEMNIST experiment, and adopting the FEMNIST as the public dataset for CIFAR-10 experiment.\nThe “FedMD, Near-Trans” indicates a near-transfer case by adopting the EMNIST as the public dataset for FEMNIST experiment, and adopting the CIFAR-100 as the public dataset for CIFAR-10 experiment.\nWe find that pFedGate still shows superiority in terms of the average/bottom accuracy, and robustness when we vary the sparsity\nfor pFedGate and vary the public dataset for FedMD."

In Section 7.6, we vary the sparsity factor s𝑠s from 1 to 0.1 to examine the accuracy of pFedGate.\nHere we further compare the accuracy of both the local (personalized) models and the global (shared) model.\nWe firstly directly examined the accuracy of the global model for the same number of FL rounds when the local model achieved the best performance, and find that the accuracy of the global model can be very bad as in the proposed pFedGate method, the global model does not receive a direct correction signal for the ground truth (but rather via a sparse adaptation).\nWe thus train the global model with one more local epoch, then aggregate the trained one and evaluate it. The results on EMNIST dataset are listed in Table 10."

            "We gain sparse local models in the proposed framework via learning personalized gating layers and predicting sparse gated weights for model sub-blocks.\nAs introduced in Section 5.2, we propose a simple and general split manner that chunks the model parameters into B𝐵B equal-sized sub-blocks, where the split factor B𝐵B provides flexible splitting granularity.\nHere we study the sparsification technique proposed in our method by varying the split factor B𝐵B and comparing it with a SOTA PFL method FedMask (Li et al., 2021a), that adopts binary masks to compress the parameters of models’ last layers. The results are shown in Table 13, where we examine the FL accuracy by setting B=[2,5,10]𝐵2510B=[2,5,10] and s=[0.3,0.5]𝑠0.30.5s=[0.3,0.5].",
            "From Table 13 we have the following observations:\nOur method achieves better performance than FedMask in various sparsity settings. Besides, when increasing the sparsity (s=0.5𝑠0.5s=0.5 to s=0.3𝑠0.3s=0.3), our method with B=5𝐵5B=5 still achieves good or even better performance (the accuracy change is +0.248 on average) while FedMask gains large performance drops (the accuracy change is -1.543 on average). These results verify the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive sparse weights prediction again.\nNote that FedMask freezes the local models during the whole FL process and only learns the binary masks for the last several layers of the models. Instead, we train both the local models and the personalized gating layers, which generate continuous gated weights to mask some sub-blocks and scale the weights of other sub-blocks, leading to high capacities for the learnable personalized models.\nWith a smaller sparsity hyper-parameter value, the size of the model’s hypothesis space searched by FedMask (depicted by only the masks for the last several layers) is much smaller than the one of pFedGate (depicted by both the whole model and the gating weights for all the sub-blocks)."
