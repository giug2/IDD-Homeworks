            "However, our methods outperform both RM and PRM even in the perturbed setting.\nAt the end of the evaluation, i.e. after 2​T=642𝑇642T=64 iterations, NOA achieve almost an order of magnitude lower exploitability. This translate to RM needing 20.320.320.3 and 3.63.63.6 times more iterations than NOA and NPRM respectively to achieve the same exploitability, see Table 1(a).\nFinally, we can see that NPRM is indeed able to minimize regret far above the number of iterations it has been trained to do so (see Theorem 1). Perhaps surprisingly, the same is true for NOA.",
            "Our results, presented in Figure 3 show our method can outperform (P)RM even in a sequential setting.\nSpecifically, even in the perturbed setting after 2​T2𝑇2T steps, it would take 73.7, resp. 16-times more steps for RM to reach the final exploitability of NOA, resp. NPRM (see Table 1(b))."
