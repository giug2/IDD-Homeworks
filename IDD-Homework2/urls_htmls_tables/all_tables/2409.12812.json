            "The conflict coordinator determines the passing sequence of vehicles in each conflict pair based on the severity of the conflict. In this process, traffic rules and social norms in the driving process are simultaneously considered by the conflict coordinator. For example, as shown in Fig.  1 , according to traffic rules, turning vehicles should yield to going-straight vehicles. Hence, after negotiation, the conflict coordinator determines that  CAV 2 subscript CAV 2 \\text{CAV}_{2} CAV start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT  should yield in this pair of conflicts. The negotiation result and reasons are sent to the decision function to make the final decision. However, it is important to note that the negotiation result is advisory, and the final decision also depends on other factors in the ego vehicles surrounding environment.",
