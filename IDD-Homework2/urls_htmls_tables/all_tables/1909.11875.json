In particular, state-of-the art DNN model training can involve the communication of millions of parameters for aggregation. Secondly, in a large and complex mobile edge network, the heterogeneity of participating devices in terms of data quality, computation power, and willingness to participate have to be well managed from the resource allocation perspective. Thirdly, FL does not guarantee privacy in the presence of malicious participants or aggregating servers.

            "Note\nthat the FL training process can be used for different ML\nmodels that essentially use the SGD method such as Support\nVector Machines (SVMs) [65], neural networks, and linear regression [66].\nA training dataset usually contains a set of n𝑛n data feature vectors\n𝐱={𝐱1,…,𝐱n}𝐱subscript𝐱1…subscript𝐱𝑛\\mathbf{x}=\\{\\mathbf{x}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathbf{x}_{n}\\} and a set of\ncorresponding data labels111In the case of unsupervised learning, there is no data label.\n𝐲={y1,…,yn}𝐲subscript𝑦1…subscript𝑦𝑛\\mathbf{y}=\\{y_{1},\\ldots,y_{n}\\}.

Table III summarizes several\nloss functions of common ML models [67].",
            "Given the heterogeneity of data distribution across devices, there has been an increasing number of studies that borrow concepts from multi-task learning [75] to learn separate, but structurally related models for each participant. Instead of minimizing the conventional loss function presented previously in Table III, the loss function is modified to also model the relationship amongst tasks [76]. Then, the MOCHA algorithm is proposed in which an alternating optimization approach [77] is used to approximately solve the minimization problem. Interestingly, MOCHA can also be calibrated based on the resource constraints of a participating device. For example, the quality of approximation can be adaptively adjusted based on network conditions and CPU states of the participating devices. However, MOCHA cannot be applied to non-convex DL models.",
            "where Fksubscript𝐹𝑘F_{k} refers to the standard loss functions presented in Table III, q𝑞q refers to the calibration of fairness in the system model, i.e., setting q=0𝑞0q=0 returns the formulation to the typical FL objective, and pksubscript𝑝𝑘p_{k} refers to ratio of local samples to the total number of training samples. In fact, this is a generalization of the Agnostic FL (AFL) algorithm proposed in [122], in which the device with the highest loss dominates the entire loss function. The simulation results show that the proposed q-FFL can achieve lower variance of testing accuracy and converges more quickly than the AFL algorithm. However, as expected, for some calibrations of the q-FFL algorithm, there can be convergence slowdown since stragglers can delay the training process. As such, an asynchronous aggregation approach (to be subsequently discussed in this section) can potentially be considered for use with the q-FFL algorithm."

            "In [171], the authors investigate impacts of a sybil-based data poisoning attack to a FL system. In particular, for the sybil attack, a malicious participant tries to improve the effectiveness of data poisoning in training the global model by creating multiple malicious participants. In Table VI, the authors show that with only two malicious participants, the attack success rate can achieve up to 96.2%, and now the FL model is unable to correctly classify the image of “1” (instead it always incorrectly predicts them to be the image of “7”). To mitigate sybil attacks, the authors then propose a defense strategy, namely FoolsGold. The key idea of this approach is that honest participants can be distinguished from sybil participants based on their updated gradients. Specifically, in the non-IID FL setting, each participant’s training data has its own particularities, and sybil participants will contribute gradients that appear more similar to each other than those of other honest participants. With FoolsGold, the system can defend the sybil data poisoning attack with minimal changes to the conventional FL process and without requiring any auxiliary information outside of the learning process. Through simulations results on 3 diverse datasets (MNIST [163], KDDCup [172], Amazon Reviews [172]), the authors show that FoolsGold can mitigate the attack under a variety of conditions, including different distributions of participant data, varying poisoning targets, and various attack strategies."

            "In this section, we have discussed two key issues, i.e., privacy and security, when trained models are exchanged in FL. In general, it is believed that FL is an effective privacy-preserving learning solution for participants to perform collaborative model training. However, in this section, we have shown that a malicious participant can exploit the process and gain access to sensitive information of other participants. Furthermore, we have also shown that by using the shared model in FL, an attacker can perform attacks which can not only breakdown the whole learning system, but also falsify the trained model to achieve its malicious goal. In addition, solutions to deal with these issues have also been reviewed, which are especially important in order to guide FL system administrators in designing and implementing the appropriate countermeasures. We summarize the key information of attacks and their corresponding countermeasures in Table VII."
