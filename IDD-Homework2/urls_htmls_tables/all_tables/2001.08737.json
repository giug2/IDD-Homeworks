            "We solve k1∗superscriptsubscript𝑘1k_{1}^{*} and k2∗superscriptsubscript𝑘2k_{2}^{*} numerically with the following parameters: we let d=7850,s=2​dformulae-sequence𝑑7850𝑠2𝑑d=7850,\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ s=2d, P1=80,P2=20formulae-sequencesubscript𝑃180subscript𝑃220P_{1}=80,P_{2}=20, so that the individual and sum capacities for this setting are C1=3.1699,C2=2.1962formulae-sequencesubscript𝐶13.1699subscript𝐶22.1962C_{1}=3.1699,\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ C_{2}=2.1962 and C1,2=3.3291subscript𝐶123.3291C_{1,2}=3.3291.

We fix Δ2=50subscriptΔ250\\Delta_{2}=50 and vary Δ1subscriptΔ1\\Delta_{1} from 111 to 350035003500 to understand the impact of the ratio of dynamic range Δ1/Δ2subscriptΔ1subscriptΔ2\\Delta_{1}/\\Delta_{2} on the quantization budgets. It can be seen in Fig. 3 and Table 1 that by using proposed MAC aware scheme, the PS allocates more rate towards the user whose gradients are more informative (higher dynamic range). For instance, when Δ1/Δ2=1subscriptΔ1subscriptΔ21\\Delta_{1}/\\Delta_{2}=1, gradients from both users are equally informative, and both users are assigned equal quantization budgets k1=k2=10subscript𝑘1subscript𝑘210k_{1}=k_{2}=10. On one extreme, when Δ1/Δ2≤0.16subscriptΔ1subscriptΔ20.16\\Delta_{1}/\\Delta_{2}\\leq 0.16, gradients from user 222 are considered more useful than user 111, the optimal allocation is k1=4subscript𝑘14k_{1}=4, k2=21subscript𝑘221k_{2}=21. On the other extreme, if Δ1/Δ2≥69.28subscriptΔ1subscriptΔ269.28\\Delta_{1}/\\Delta_{2}\\geq 69.28, gradients from user 111 are more informative, hence we see that k1=50subscript𝑘150k_{1}=50, and k2=2subscript𝑘22k_{2}=2."

            "In Fig. 4, we let P1=0.95​P¯subscript𝑃10.95¯𝑃P_{1}=0.95\\bar{P} and P2=0.05​P¯subscript𝑃20.05¯𝑃P_{2}=0.05\\bar{P}, and compare the proposed MAC aware gradient quantization scheme with the following schemes: a)a) uniform rate allocation subject to MAC capacity constraints, b)b) a recently proposed digital scheme in [11], c)c) SignSGD, which uses 111 bit quantization per dimension for each user [2], and d)d) TernGrad [3], which uses three levels {−1,0,+1}101\\{-1,0,+1\\} to quantize each dimension of the gradient. We also plot the non-quantized full resolution scheme as a baseline. In the digital scheme proposed in [11], all but the highest qtsubscript𝑞𝑡q_{t} and lowest qtsubscript𝑞𝑡q_{t} gradient values are set to zero. The remaining gradient values are then split into two groups depending on their signs. The mean of elements in each group is computed, denoted by αavg+superscriptsubscript𝛼avg\\alpha_{\\text{avg}}^{+} and αavg−superscriptsubscript𝛼avg\\alpha_{\\text{avg}}^{-}. If αavg+>|αavg−|superscriptsubscript𝛼avgsuperscriptsubscript𝛼avg\\alpha_{\\text{avg}}^{+}>|\\alpha_{\\text{avg}}^{-}| (αavg+<|αavg−|superscriptsubscript𝛼avgsuperscriptsubscript𝛼avg\\alpha_{\\text{avg}}^{+}<|\\alpha_{\\text{avg}}^{-}|), all remaining positive (negative) values will be set to αavg+superscriptsubscript𝛼avg\\alpha_{\\text{avg}}^{+} (αavg−superscriptsubscript𝛼avg\\alpha_{\\text{avg}}^{-}). Each user then transmits the location of qtsubscript𝑞𝑡q_{t} non-zero values and a scalar (using c𝑐c bits) to describe the average value at each iteration. Therefore, the communication cost is log2⁡(dqt)+csubscript2binomial𝑑subscript𝑞𝑡𝑐\\log_{2}\\binom{d}{q_{t}}+c. This scheme [11] is fundamentally different than the one proposed in this paper, and, moreover, the quantization budget qtsubscript𝑞𝑡q_{t} is the same for all users. As shown in Fig. 4, the proposed MAC aware multi-level scheme outperforms the uniform multilevel scheme, the scheme in [11], SignSGD and TernGrad. This is due to the fact that log⁡(dqt)binomial𝑑subscript𝑞𝑡\\log\\binom{d}{q_{t}} grows exponentially as qtsubscript𝑞𝑡q_{t} increases. In addition, the rates are limited by the user with the worst channel. Therefore, as it reaches the capacity of the user with the worst channel, qtsubscript𝑞𝑡q_{t} is still small compared to d𝑑d. Other schemes such as SignSGD and TernGrad suffer from underutilization of channel resources, as they use a fixed quantization budget (111 bit, and 222 bits respectively per gradient dimension). We also show the testing accuracy of each scheme at the end of 100010001000 iterations (see Table 2). They are consistent with Fig. 4 where our proposed scheme is the closest to full resolution."

It can be seen in Fig. 5 that the performance improves monotonically with the increase in total power. The testing accuracy at the end of T=1000𝑇1000T=1000 iterations is shown in Table 3 as a function of the total power."
