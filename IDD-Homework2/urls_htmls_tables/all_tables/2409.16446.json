Our network segments stones, wooden boards, and cylinders using different colors, producing segmentation results that closely match real-world conditions.\nFig. 8 illustrates the differences between our point cloud completion results and those from other methods. Completing complex underground sparse point clouds directly poses a challenge, as small stones cause significant interference. Additionally, due to the sparseness of the point cloud, if the network fails to recognize which points belong to the same object, it is likely to complete them as two separate objects, thus introducing errors in underground mapping. To address this, we introduce a segmentation task that allows the network to complete point clouds of single objects without causing fragmentation. Compared to the real situation in (a), our results closely match the ground truth.\nTo quantitatively analyze the accuracy of our mapping, we use the evaluation metrics from [10, 20], which include Pred-GT (prediction to ground truth) and GT-Pred (ground truth to prediction) errors. Pred-GT error calculates the average squared distance from each predicted point to its nearest ground truth point, assessing the prediction’s deviation from the ground truth. Conversely, GT-Pred error measures the average squared distance from each ground truth point to its nearest predicted point, reflecting the extent to which the predicted shape covers the ground truth surface.\nTable 1 demonstrates that our method outperforms others in all categories for both Pred-GT and GT-Pred errors. It is important to note that the overall error in the completed map originates from two factors: the prediction error in the missing area and changes to the original partial shape.

            "Through feature matching of A-scan data, we identify the specific locations of unknown sites on an established map. Initially, we collected A-scan data from 2000 different locations within a broad area, representing known positions on the map. Each A-scan dataset captures the underground features of its corresponding location, laying the groundwork for subsequent matching processes. We randomly select or designate an unknown site and collect A-scan data from it. Then, using a feature matching algorithm, we compare the A-scan data of this unknown site with that of the 2000 known locations in the map database. Using the NetVLAD network, we extract underground image features from the A-scan data and apply matching algorithms to find the database location most similar to the A-scan features of the unknown site. We assume the unknown site is closest to the location corresponding to the matched A-scan, serving as our localization result.\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of this localization method, we introduce recall rate as the primary evaluation metric. The recall rate is calculated by comparing the positions matched by the algorithm with the actual real positions of the unknown sites. Specifically, if the location identified by the matching algorithm is the closest among all known locations to the unknown site, we consider the match successful. A total of 200 A-scan datasets from unknown locations were used for position identification.\nMoreover, acknowledging the influence of varying soil compositions on A-scan data representation, we extended our experiment to include six distinct soil types: dry sand, wet sand, dry clay, wet clay, loamy sand, and wet loamy sand, each associated with unique Relative Permittivity and Conductivity values. The variances in these properties notably impact the radar wave’s velocity and the signal’s attenuation rate, thereby affecting the A-scan results’ reflectivity and depth detectability.\nTable 2 shows a notably high matching accuracy for lower conductivity and relative permittivity materials, such as sand, reaching 88%. Although accuracy slightly reduced for clay to 84.5%, and further to 81% for loamy sand variants, these results still fell within a satisfactory accuracy range. Through this extensive evaluation across varied geological conditions, we aim to delve into the nuanced effects of soil composition on A-scan feature matching accuracy, thereby enriching our understanding and methodologies for subterranean detection and localization."
