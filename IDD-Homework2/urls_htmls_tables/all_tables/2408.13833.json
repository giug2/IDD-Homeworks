            "On the JAMA case challenges, OpenBioLLM-70B achieved the highest accuracy at 66%, followed by Llama-3-70B-Instruct at 65%. JSL-MedMNX-7B-SFT achieved 54% accuracy, slightly higher than its base model Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 with 52%. Notably, Llama-3-8B-Instruct (57%) outperformed its biomedical counterpart OpenBioLLM-8B (18%). Also, the Llama 1 based model MedAlpaca 7b outperformed OpenBioLLM-8B with 22% accuracy. BioMistral-7B (28%) underperformed compared to Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2. In contrast med42-70B and JSL-MedMNX-7B-SFT performed better than their respective baseline models.  For the NEJM cases, OpenBioLLM-70B and Llama-3-70B-Instruct both achieved 74% accuracy. Llama-3-8B-Instruct (64%) again outperformed OpenBioLLM-8B (30%). JSL-MedMNX-7B-SFT and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 performed similarly (47% and 46% respectively). BioMistral-7B (37%) again underperformed compared to its base model. PMC-Llama-7B and Meditron-7b showed poor performance on both datasets. Table  1  provides an overview of model accuracy in the clinical case vignettes. Figure  1  provide an overview of the performance on all evaluated tasks.",
