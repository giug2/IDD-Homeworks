            "Our 3D fruit tracking results are detailed in Table I. For a total of 60 apple trees, we obtain a 3.1% total count error. We estimate 1846 apples from our algorithm, and when compared to the ground truth of 1790 apples, it gives us an absolute total count error of 56 apples. Compared to ground truth, our method tends to overestimate counts, primarily due to (1) double counting some fruits due to noisy fruit instance point clouds and (2) counting fruits fallen on the ground, which are excluded when we generate the ground truth. In particular, noisy fruit instance point clouds are obtained because some small and partially occluded fruits cannot accurately be fused from the RGB detections and the point clouds. Hence, they contain noisy background information, which induces errors in their estimated 3D positions.",
            "Fig. 4 shows a per tree-batch count estimation compared to the corresponding ground truth. A total of 22 batches, each with two or three trees, was created from 60 apple trees, and their per-batch fruit count was compared with the per-batch ground truth. Trees were separated into these batches based on how easily human annotators can distinguish tree boundaries to generate accurate ground truth counts. We decided to use tree batches for method evaluation instead of individual trees because, when trees are very close together, it is challenging to accurately assign fruits to one or the other.\nAs seen from the above-mentioned figure, our method consistently estimates fruit counts for trees despite the varying fruit densities and canopy structures of the trees. Similarly, the low standard deviation of absolute count error (5 apples) and the small mean of absolute count error (6 apples) shown in Table I demonstrates the precision and consistency of our method across the entire data sequence. Note that per tree-batch count errors may include human-induced inaccuracies, which may skew the results, as even human annotators can face ambiguity when assigning fruits to specific trees."
