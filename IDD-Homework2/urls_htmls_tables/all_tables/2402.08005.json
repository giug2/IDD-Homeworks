(2023). After we generate the responses with the Mixtral teacher model, we use the self-critique approach from 3.1 to generate the synthetic preference dataset. As for the RM, we use the gpt-3.5-turbo model to classify the responses into unsafe (0) or safe (1). We call this scalar output the Safety Score. Using an auxiliary dataset, the F1-score of this RM for assessing safety is 98%. Lastly, we distil two different student models over this synthetic dataset, using different methods. Results are shown in Table 1. Note that for both models, distillation with rDPO achieves the highest score. This is because around 18% of revised responses in the synthetic dataset didn\u2019t pass the safety filter, so rDPO successfully manages to learn despite this noise.

I really like the argument. Argument: &#8221;We have recently conducted a performance review of our sales team to evaluate their effectiveness in meeting targets. The results show that 80% of the team consistently achieved or exceeded their sales goals, demonstrating their commitment and hard work. However, it is important to note that some members of the team fell short of their targets. While they may argue that external factors such as market conditions and customer preferences played a role in their underperformance, it is crucial to remind them that their colleagues faced the same challenges and still managed to excel. This indicates that those who did not meet their targets should take responsibility for their own shortcomings and strive to improve. With proper training and support, we expect to see better results from all team members in the future.&#8221;</span>\n</span>\n</td>\n<td id=\"A1.T5.1.5.4.2\" class=\"ltx_td ltx_align_left ltx_border_t\">dSC</td>\n<td id=\"A1.T5.1.5.4.3\" class=\"ltx_td ltx_align_left ltx_border_t\">\n<span id=\"A1.T5.1.5.4.3.1\" class=\"ltx_inline-block ltx_align_top\">\n<span id=\"A1.T5.1.5.4.3.1.1\" class=\"ltx_p\" style=\"width:142.3pt;\">The performance review of the sales team seems thorough and fair in its assessment. It highlights the achievements of the majority of the team, but also acknowledges the underperformance of some members. It is important to consider external factors that may have influenced results, but the team members also need to reflect on their own contributions and take responsibility for areas they may need to improve. The provision of training and support is a proactive step to help the team members overcome their shortcomings and improve their performance. Overall, the argument is well supported and provides a fair assessment of the team&#8217;s performance.</span>\n</span>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr id=\"A1.T5.1.6.5\" class=\"ltx_tr\">\n<td id=\"A1.T5.1.6.5.1\" class=\"ltx_td ltx_border_bb\"></td>\n<td id=\"A1.T5.1.6.5.2\" class=\"ltx_td ltx_align_left ltx_border_bb\">rDPO</td>\n<td id=\"A1.T5.1.6.5.3\" class=\"ltx_td ltx_align_left ltx_border_bb\">\n<span id=\"A1.T5.1.6.5.3.1\" class=\"ltx_inline-block ltx_align_top\">\n<span id=\"A1.T5.1.6.5.3.1.1\" class=\"ltx_p\" style=\"width:142.3pt;\">This argument presents a discussion of a sales team&#8217;s sales performance following a recent review, highlighting the performance of the majority (80%) versus the underperforming minority. The review suggests that while the external factors played a role in the underperformance of some team members, their peers managed to overcome the same challenges. The argument encourages improving the performance of team members who did not meet their targets by providing proper training and support.

            "LLMs tend to exhibit sycophancy, specifically when asked for an opinion (Perez et\u00a0al., 2022). We use the argument prompts from SycophancyEval, which ask for feedback on provided argument contexts. As done in Weston & Sukhbaatar (2023), we introduce opinions in the prompt (e.g., I wrote this argument or I didn\u2019t like this argument) to make the model engage in sycophantic behavior and deviate from an objective response. We evaluate on 200 prompts using the Mixtral model to generate the original response, and then revise it to improve its objectivity with self-critique. Then, we prompt the RM to measure the objectivity of the responses in a similar way to Weston & Sukhbaatar (2023) (Obj. Score). We distil over the student model, SOLAR-10-7B using the different methods, and the results over the test set of prompts are shown in Table 2(b). We also compute a Quality Score with GPT-4, measuring the quality of the generated feedback. While all the distilled variants show slightly decreased quality score, the objective score is sharply increased, achieving the highest value when fine-tuning with rDPO.

            "We aim to improve safety by avoiding harmful content from the LLM, using a collection of adversarial prompts from Harmful Behaviors (Zou et\u00a0al., 2023), with the addition of jailbreak templates from Shen et\u00a0al. (2023). After we generate the responses with the Mixtral teacher model, we use the self-critique approach from 3.1 to generate the synthetic preference dataset. As for the RM, we use the gpt-3.5-turbo model to classify the responses into unsafe (0) or safe (1). We call this scalar output the Safety Score. Using an auxiliary dataset, the F1-score of this RM for assessing safety is 98%. Lastly, we distil two different student models over this synthetic dataset, using different methods. Results are shown in Table 1. Note that for both models, distillation with rDPO achieves the highest score. This is because around 18% of revised responses in the synthetic dataset didn\u2019t pass the safety filter, so rDPO successfully manages to learn despite this noise. Table 3 shows several generations from the distilled models.",
            "Since a too conservative distillation procedure could render the student LLM unusable (by refusing to response any question, even harmless ones), we also compute an auxiliary metric, the Honesty Score, which is computed over a set of 61 harmless prompts from the HHH benchmark (Askell et\u00a0al., 2021). We can see from the last column in Table 1 that this score even improves when comparing with the base, unaligned LLM, for rDPO."
