We designate the first  k s subscript k s k_{s} italic_k start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_s end_POSTSUBSCRIPT  of the latent factors as corresponding to protected features of items, and the remaining  k  k s k subscript k s k-k_{s} italic_k - italic_k start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_s end_POSTSUBSCRIPT  factors correspond to other aspects of the items. Thus, we can generate data with multiple protected features for studying intersection impacts of fairness-aware re-ranking."
