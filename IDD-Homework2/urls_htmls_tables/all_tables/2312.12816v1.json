            "We conduct the proposed APL model with the DETR object detector here. An ablation study of different object detectors will be shown in the next section.\nThe experimental results are shown in Table 1.\nWe report the model performance on different question types.\nFirst, our method significantly surpasses the previous SOTA method COCA (Lao et al. 2023) on audio question answering and visual question answering: the corresponding average accuracy values are improved by 2.67%\nand 4.46%,\nrespectively.\nQuestions under these two settings are simpler and only related to a single modality.\nThe performance improvements indicate the proposed method has a better ability to perceive single-modal scenes.\nSecond, our method is also superior in more challenging audio-visual question answering. Performance of the most competitive method COCA is close to the previous method STG (Li et al. 2022), while our method achieves 1% improvements.\nThese results reveal that our approach is superior in various QA settings.\nMoreover, we can also notice that it is more difficult for a model simultaneously handle different audio-visual question types as they focus on different audio-visual clues.\nParticularly, our method brings obvious improvement for the question type of ‘counting’, achieving 73.29% accuracy which considerably surpasses the second-best method STG (69.88%). This result verifies the benefits of our object-aware method design.",
            "Impacts of Object Detectors.\nTo explore the impact of object detectors in our method, here we employ the popular Faster R-CNN and DETR to implement the proposed method, respectively.\nAs shown in the bottom part of Table 1, our method using the stronger DETR has the best performance, approaching 74.53% QA accuracy.\nAlso, it is noteworthy that our method equipped with each object detector is superior to existing methods.\nThese results demonstrate the generalization and robustness of our method.\nIn the following experiments, unless otherwise specified, we adopt the DETR as the object detector."

The cross-modal similarity of each question-object (or audio-object) pair will be 0.01 if they share the same attention.\nφ=0.011𝜑0.011\\varphi=0.011 is slightly larger than this value to ensure that fewer highly matched pairs are selected.\nWhen all the objects are selected as positivities (φ=0𝜑0\\varphi=0), ℒq​osubscriptℒ𝑞𝑜\\mathcal{L}_{qo} (Eq. 6) and ℒa​osubscriptℒ𝑎𝑜\\mathcal{L}_{ao} are equal to 0, the model has sub-optimal performance."
