            "The trade-off between compression and the retention of critical trajectory information is a long-standing problem. Traditional lossy compression methods have been developed to reduce the size of GPS data, but they tend to obscure key features such as rapid changes in direction, sharp turns, or short-distance deviations. These dynamics are essential for understanding specific mobility behaviors, such as vehicle movements in congested areas or pedestrian paths in crowded environments. Furthermore, the compression process often removes intricate details that could be vital for applications like precise traffic flow analysis, emergency evacuation planning, or identifying anomalous behavior patterns in real-time  ( Makris et al . ,  2021 ;  Muckell et al . ,  2014 ) .",
            "Several studies  ( You et al . ,  2007 ;  Suzuki et al . ,  2010 )  have concentrated on protecting user privacy by introducing dummy data into mobility datasets. The approach proposed in  ( You et al . ,  2007 )  introduces false location points into the trajectory in either a random or rotational fashion. To create more realistic trajectories, the authors of  ( Suzuki et al . ,  2010 )  proposed generating dummy locations by constraining the users movement. This technique enhances anonymity within a specified spatial area while maintaining the plausibility of the trajectory. However, it has limitations, such as when an attacker possesses prior knowledge of the users lifestyle, they could potentially infer the users interests or actual location  ( Hemkumar et al . ,  2020 ) .",
            "In addition to these approaches, synthesis-based methods for privacy protection have been introduced, which involve replacing the original mobility data with synthetic data  ( Rao et al . ,  2020 ;  Abul et al . ,  2008 ;  Zhu et al . ,  2023 ) . One of the key concepts in this context is k-anonymity, which guarantees privacy by ensuring that there are at least  k k k italic_k  users with similar characteristics, thus preventing an attacker from narrowing down the potential users to fewer than  k k k italic_k , even when attempting to identify a user based on specific traits. To achieve k-anonymity in mobility data, the method proposed in  ( Abul et al . ,  2008 )  incorporates uncertainty into the location data. To address privacy concerns more effectively, differential privacy has emerged as a leading technique for anonymization and privacy preservation  ( Jiang et al . ,  2013 ,  2021 ) . This is a mathematical framework that adds noise to the data, ensuring a certain degree of privacy protection. Several techniques, such as CNoise and SDD  ( Jiang et al . ,  2013 ) , have been introduced to apply differential privacy to mobility trajectory data by adding noise to guarantee privacy. The added noise and the corresponding level of privacy have been mathematically validated, making this approach more robust than others. For creating realistic synthetic mobility data, DiffTraj  ( Zhu et al . ,  2023 )  generates a synthetic location dataset using a diffusion model. LSTM-trajGAN and recent pioneering work ( Ozeki et al . ,  2022 ,  2023b ;  Yonekura et al . ,  2023 ) , on the other hand, generates synthetic mobility data using LSTM and replaces the original dataset with this synthetic version. Since LSTM-trajGAN employs a GAN-based approach to train the LSTM generator, the resulting synthetic trajectories are expected to be highly realistic. Nevertheless, these methods do not fully guarantee the privacy and utility of the generated data.",
            "One common approach to trajectory reconstruction is map matching, as demonstrated in studies like  ( Newson and Krumm ,  2009 ;  Yuan et al . ,  2010 ;  Lou et al . ,  2009 ) . These methods often employ models like the hidden Markov model or rely on a voting process among sampled points. Other approaches  ( Wang et al . ,  2021 ;  Li et al . ,  2016 )  leverage historical trajectory data and road network information to recover missing trajectories. The authors of  ( Li et al . ,  2016 )  focus on junctions in urban regions, extracting a basic trajectory skeleton from sparse data and using a clustering framework to reconstruct incomplete GPS trajectories. The authors of  ( Wang et al . ,  2021 )  use LSTM-based autoencoder architecture for recovery from sub-trajectory to the whole trajectory and use Kalman Filter to decrease the noise and calibrate trajectory estimation. KAMEL ( Musleh and Mokbel ,  2023 )  adapts the BERT concept to realize trajectory imputation without using map geometry. They partition the area and regard a cell as a word so that the data can be processed through a BERT-like architecture. By introducing the spatial constraints, they make it possible to impute trajectories. Additionally, there are studies that do not rely on map information for trajectory reconstruction or imputation, such as  ( Chen et al . ,  2016 ;  Ruan et al . ,  2020 ;  Qin et al . ,  2023 ) . Among them, INGRAIN ( Qin et al . ,  2023 )  employs the attention mechanism of transformer architectures to impute missing data.",
            "The system is designed to reconstruct high-resolution GPS trajectory data from low-resolution, privacy-preserved inputs. As shown in Figure  1 , it consists of three main modules: virtual data collection, data processing, and model training. These components work in tandem, utilizing advanced deep learning methods such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Transformer models to accurately reconstruct trajectory data while taking into account both the spatial and temporal dimensions.",
            "To evaluate the proposed system, we utilized the Beijing trajectory dataset  ( Zheng et al . ,  2011 ) , a large-scale public dataset containing real-world human mobility data. From this dataset, we selected trajectories with sequence lengths not exceeding 128 points. We generated a total of 25,769 virtual GPS trajectories within the Beijing region to train our model. The synthetic data generation ensures that the model can learn region-specific mobility patterns while being tested on real-world trajectory data. This approach allows us to control the characteristics of the data used for training, such as sequence length and density, making it adaptable to different urban scenarios.",
            "For privacy preservation, we applied rounding to the GPS values in the dataset using the H3 indexing system  ( Wozniak and Szymanski ,  2021 ) . Each GPS point was snapped to the center of its corresponding H3 hexagonal cell, ensuring that the spatial resolution of the data was reduced. This truncation simulates real-world practices where GPS data is often obfuscated for privacy protection.  1 1 1 H3 is a geospatial indexing system that divides the globe into hexagonal cells. Each cell is assigned a unique identifier, and by snapping GPS points to the nearest cell center, we reduce the granularity of the data, preserving privacy while introducing spatial errors.",
            "The performance metrics, summarized in Table  1 , provide further evidence of the models strength. Our proposed system achieves an average reconstruction error of 0.198 km, which is a significant improvement over the map-matching algorithms average error of 0.632 km. This result demonstrates superior generalization capabilities. The substantial reduction in reconstruction error suggests that the model can handle both real and synthetic data effectively, improving upon the initial inaccuracies introduced during the generative process."
