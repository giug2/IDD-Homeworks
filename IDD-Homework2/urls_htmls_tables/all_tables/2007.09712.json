            "In this section, the proposed framework is applied to four real-world datasets, i.e., power demand 111https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ , space shuttle 222https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+(Shuttle), ECG 333https://physionet.org/about/database/, and engine 444https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php for performance demonstration. These datasets are time series datasets collected by different types of sensors from different fields [6]. For example, the power demand dataset is composed of electricity consumption data recorded by the electricity meter. There are normal subsequences and anomalous subsequences in these datasets. As shown in Table I, X𝑋X, Xnsubscript𝑋𝑛X_{n}, and Xasubscript𝑋𝑎X_{a} is a number of original sequences, normal subsequences, and anomalous subsequences, respectively. For the power demand dataset, the anomalous subsequences indicate that the electricity meter has failed or stop working. Therefore, we need to use these datasets to train a FL model that can detect anomalies.\nWe divide all datasets into a training set and a test set in a 7: 3 ratio. We implement the proposed framework by using Pytorch and PySyft [40]. The experiment is conducted on a virtual workstation with the Ubuntu 18.04 operation system, Intel (R) Core (TM) i5-4210M CPU, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD."
