            "The main target is a rock on the bottom of the water-tank scene of Fig. 11a1 in water depth of 2.5 ft; with 6-8 inches in various dimensions and similar shape to coral one. Fig.  11 a depicts a sample pseudo-colored image from an Oculus sonar in the same 90 rotated configuration. Water surface waves with magnitude of a few inches are introduced to disturb the mirror and ghost components (not visualized in a static image, the latter can be detected when viewing the video).

            "Starting with the SC solution, the optimizing for each water-surface fluctuation level is carried out by assuming a flat air-water interface. We compare the volumetric errors (normalized with respect to the 3-D optimized Kinect Model) after five optimization iterations for both the flat water surface (  = 0  0 \\sigma=0 italic_ = 0 ) and different fluctuation levels. Fig.  12 (a) depicts one sample plot of the normalized volumetric error -vs- iteration number. Noting negligible impact from the interface fluctuations, the average and standard deviations of these errors, given in Fig.  12 (b), have been calculated by repeating the experiment only 20 times (for each air-water interface fluctuation level). The negligible volumetric error variations is partly attributed to small deviations in the lower contour, and discarded outliers during the ICP-based contour matching process (in the first step of 3-D model optimization in Fig.  4 )."
