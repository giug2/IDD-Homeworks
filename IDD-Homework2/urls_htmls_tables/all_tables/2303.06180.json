            "In the experiment with distributed iid data with complete labels, on the held-out NIH test set, we observe that the performance of FedFBN is comparable to, if not slightly better than, the baseline NIH model with a mean AUROC 0.82 (p=0.07𝑝0.07p=0.07). We also observe that FedFBN performs comparably to FedAvg (p=0.25𝑝0.25p=0.25), while slightly outperforming the local FedBN model (p=0.01𝑝0.01p=0.01). On the MIMIC external test set, we observe that FedFBN generalizes better to unseen distributions and outperforms all models with a mean AUROC of 0.75 (p<0.001𝑝0.001p<0.001).

Moreover, across all test sets, FedFBN outperforms FedAvg and the local FedBN model (p<0.001𝑝0.001p<0.001). As expected, the local FedBN model performs poorly due it’s drawback in scenarios with partial labels.
