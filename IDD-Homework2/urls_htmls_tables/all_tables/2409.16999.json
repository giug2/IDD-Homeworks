            "To further showcase the effectiveness of the augmentation achieved through  WasteGAN  in improving waste segregation, we integrated a semantic segmentation model trained on the augmented datasets into a real-world waste sorting system, composed of an industrial robot equipped with a vacuum gripper. Leveraging semantic segmentation of the scene, we determine optimal grasping points for target contaminant objects, enabling a robot equipped with a vacuum gripper to remove them from the waste stream. Notably, our approach addresses cluttered scenarios akin to those encountered in actual waste sorting facilities, distinguishing it from previous studies  [ 16 ]  that usually assume well-separated objects. The overall scheme of the proposed approach is illustrated in Fig.  1 , starting from the top you can appreciate our data augmentation technique based on  WasteGAN  and the consequent grasping point generation for robotic sorting."
