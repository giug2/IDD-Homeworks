            "Figure  1  illustrates the comprehensive architecture of our RAG system, adjusted and adapted as the data exploration system proposed in this study. Our RAG architecture integrates an LLM with an external database to generate appropriate information for user queries. Initially, in the retrieval module depicted in Figure  1 ) component labelled (I), a vector DB is established in advance as an external information source, comprising a vector of embedded metadata representations and the original metadata. The vectorization methodology is elucidated below in Section III-B. To facilitate dataset exploration, the system employs four sequential steps as follows:"
