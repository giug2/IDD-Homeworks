                "In each of the two weakly-supervised classification tasks, we considered four distinct ”institutional sites”. These sites were identified by first naturally considering all in-house BWH data as one distinct institutional site. Then, for each TCGA cohort, we identified the tissue source site for each patient case. For the purpose of simulating federated learning across multiple institutions, we then randomly partitioned the set of unique tissue source sites into 3 non-overlapping, roughly equal-sized subsets, and grouped together the data corresponding to each subset of tissue source sites to serve as 3 distinct institutional sites. Similarly, for CCRCC survival prediction, we used 3 institutional sites created by randomly partitioning the tissue source sites that contributed to the TCGA-KIRC cohort. The details of these partitions are summarized\nbelow for each task (",

Additionally, if a single patient case contains multiple diagnostic slides, all of them were drawn together into the same set when that patient is sampled. Similarly, for survival prediction, sampling is stratified based on both the discretized follow-up time (section 2.3) and the censorship status. \n",

                "In each of the two weakly-supervised classification tasks, we considered four distinct ”institutional sites”. These sites were identified by first naturally considering all in-house BWH data as one distinct institutional site. Then, for each TCGA cohort, we identified the tissue source site for each patient case. For the purpose of simulating federated learning across multiple institutions, we then randomly partitioned the set of unique tissue source sites into 3 non-overlapping, roughly equal-sized subsets, and grouped together the data corresponding to each subset of tissue source sites to serve as 3 distinct institutional sites. Similarly, for CCRCC survival prediction, we used 3 institutional sites created by randomly partitioning the tissue source sites that contributed to the TCGA-KIRC cohort. The details of these partitions are summarized\nbelow for each task (",
                "Table 1,2 and 3",
                ").",
                "Once the institutional sites were identified, the dataset is then randomly partitioned into a training, validation and test set consisting of 70%, 15% and 15% of patient cases respectively. For classification, given the class-imbalance nature of the datasets, within each institutional site, stratified sampling is used to ensure sufficient representation of minority classes across the training, validation and test set. Additionally, if a single patient case contains multiple diagnostic slides, all of them were drawn together into the same set when that patient is sampled. Similarly, for survival prediction, sampling is stratified based on both the discretized follow-up time (section 2.3) and the censorship status. \n",
                "For each task, we used the model architecture and loss function as described in detail in section 2.3.

Additionally, we monitored the validation loss each epoch and performed early stopping on the global model when it does not improve for 20 consecutive epochs (federated rounds), but only after it has been trained for at least 35 epochs. The model checkpoint with the lowest validation loss was then used to evaluation on the held-out test set.\nFor each task, we investigated 3 scenarios: ",

This can likely attributed to site 3 having a much larger local dataset (n=331) compared to the other 2 sites (n=104 and n=76 respectively).
