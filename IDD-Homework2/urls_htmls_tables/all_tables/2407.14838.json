            "The curation of our testing dataset was methodically approached to ensure rigorous assessment in both phases of our experiment. For the initial phase focused on guided detection, we utilized the set of 52 smart contracts catalogued in Table 1 of the study by David et al [11, Table 1]. This particular collection was initially sampled and presented by Zhou et al. in their work on decentralized finance (DeFi) attacks [12]. We have replicated this enumerated dataset in Table 1 of our paper, and the vulnerability types along with their descriptions were directly sourced from Table 6 in David et al.s publication [number, Table. 6]. Adopting this dataset enables us to undertake a level of replication from David et al.s experimental design while adapting the study to evaluate our RAG systems specific parameters."

            "The experiment involved the application of the RAG-LLM system to 52 smart contracts, each evaluated against a multitude of vulnerability types explicitly mentioned within the prompts. The tabulated data in Table  2  compiles the aggregated results from these individual assessments.",
            "In Phase Two, the RAG-LLM system was tested under a blind audit setup, evaluating its ability to detect vulnerabilities without explicit prompt instructions regarding the vulnerability type. The experiment involved 219 smart contracts, each undergoing 40 tests. The aggregated results are summarized in Table 2, showing a success rate of approximately 60.71%."
