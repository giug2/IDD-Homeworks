We compare FedGSP with seven state-of-the-art approaches and summarize their test accuracy, test loss and training rounds (required to reach the accuracy of 80%percent8080\\%) in Table 1. The results show that FedGSP achieves 5.3%percent5.35.3\\% higher accuracy than FedAvg and reaches the accuracy of 80%percent8080\\% within only 343434 rounds. Moreover, FedGSP outperforms all the comparison approaches, with an average of 3.7%percent3.73.7\\% higher accuracy, 0.1230.1230.123 lower loss and 84%percent8484\\% less rounds, which shows its effectiveness to improve FL performance in the presence of non-i.i.d. data."
