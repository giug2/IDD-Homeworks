            "Recent federated optimization work mostly focus on dealing with the discrepancy in data statistics of local clients and related inconsistency issues  [21, 32, 1]. For instance, FedProx deals with non-IID local data, by including a proximal term in the local loss functions [21], while FedDyn uses a dynamic proximal term based on selected clients [1]. SCAFFOLD [15] is another method suitable for non-IID local data that uses control variates to reduce client-drift. In [13] and [27], adaptive FL optimization methods for the global server are introduced, which are compatible with non-IID data distributions. Moreover, the Power-of-Choice (PoC) strategy [6], a biased client selection scheme that selects clients with higher local losses, can be used to increase the rate of convergence.",
            "There are numerous works on improving the robustness of FL; these include robust aggregation methods [31, 19, 7], reputation mechanism-based contribution examining [36], credibility-based re-weighting [4], distillation-based semi-supervised learning [14], and personalized multi-task learning [19]. However, these methods are not designed for identifying noisy labels. Even when these methods are used to detect noisy clients, either there is no mechanism for further label correction at the noisy clients [31, 19, 36, 7], or the effect of noisy labels is mitigated with the aid of an auxiliary dataset, without any direct label correction [4, 14]. One notable exception is [38], which carries out label correction during training by exchanging feature centroids between clients and server. This exchange of centroids may lead to privacy concerns, since centroids could potentially be used as part of reverse engineering to reveal non-trivial information about raw local data."
