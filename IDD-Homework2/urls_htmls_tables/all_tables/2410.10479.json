            "To address this, we incorporate 144 game types (we later refer to a type as an equivalence class) based on the Robinson-Goforth topology of 22 games  (Robinson & Goforth,  2005 ) . Classic games like the Prisoners Dilemma belong to one of the equivalence classes within this topology. Specifically, the topology of 22 games elegantly illustrates the relationships among strictly ordinal 22 games, each with a unique payoff structure, leading to different dominant strategies, Nash equilibria, and reasoning approaches (more details in Appendix  B.1 ). We categorize all the 144 games with numerical payoffs from the original topology into the  classic setting  tasks. Due to space constraints, we provide an introduction to the Robinson-Goforth topology in Appendix  B.2 .",
            "Overall, we select several SOTA models according to Open LLM Leaderboard  (Fourrier et al.,  2024 )  and conduct extensive experiments on  TMGBench . These models include GPT (gpt-4o- 2024-05-13 , gpt-4o-mini -2024-07-18 , gpt-3.5-turbo -0125 ), Claude (claude-3-5-sonnet -20240620 , claude-3-haiku -20240307 ), Llama (Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3.1-70B), and Qwen (Qwen2-72B). We perform 4 independent tests on each data point, covering both the classic setting and the story-based setting. Basically, we conduct 2,880 tests to generally evaluate a certain model. During the evaluation, we set the temperature of the tested LLMs to 0 or near 0, ensuring the lowest degree of uncertainty and enhancing the faithfulness of our evaluation. More details of the evaluation process are provided in Appendix  C.1 .",
            "As seen from Table  1 , gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini and claude-3-5-sonnet are more capable compared to others, with a high overall accuracy rate (  \\approx   80%) and low inconsistency and low bias score (  \\approx   5%). Specifically, as shown in Figure  3 , gpt-4o performs the best on 1-tasks, gpt-4o-mini beats others on 2-tasks, and claude-3-5-sonnet are relately better at 0-tasks. Moreover, comparing the performance of employing DA prompting and CoT prompting, we find that CoT prompting almost provides comprehensive improvement but few exceptions like the  PAR 2 subscript PAR 2 \\mathrm{PAR}_{2} roman_PAR start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT  of Llama-3.1-70B.",
            "To testify that this is not due to the position bias in the prompts (refer to the  FoToM  prompting and  SoToM  prompting in Appendix  C.2 ), we design the  reFoToM  prompting and the  reSoToM  prompting (refer to the  reFoToM  prompting and  reSoToM  prompting in Appendix  C.2 ) which swap the order of the players happens in the FoToM prompting and the SoToM prompting respectively. The results in Appendix  D.1  imply that such asymmetric inconsistency pattern is not strong related to the orders in the prompt. We demonstrate two typical examples of this phenomenon in Appendix  D.2 .",
            "As previously mentioned, all games in the topological framework can be categorized into three distinct groups based on the number of Nash equilibria. If we consider Nash equilibrium as the solution to finding stable strategy combinations, Figure  10  illustrates the structure of these solutions.",
            "Firstly, we have identified 20 distinct topics derived from everyday life scenarios where cooperation and competition are likely to occur. These topics align with situations commonly depicted in various game families. The distribution of story-based games across these 20 topics is visualized in Figure  11(a) .",
            "Given the nature of these long-text reasoning tasks, the scenarios within our story-based games typically range from 200 to 450 words in length. As illustrated in Figure  11(b) , over 90% of scenario lengths fall within the 250 to 400-word interval. Additionally, we provide a scatter plot of scenario lengths by topic to further demonstrate the diversity of our generated dataset.",

            "To address the above issues, we introduce  TMGBench , a benchmark that encompasses a comprehensive range of game types, features synthesized game scenarios, and supports scalable and reorganizable game forms. Specifically,  to address the first issue , we include all 144 game types defined by the Robinson-Goforth topology of 2x2 games  (Robinson & Goforth,  2005 ) . This topology encompasses a variety of game structures based on different numerical payoff matrices, including but not limited to classic games like the Prisoners Dilemma( 2.2 ).  To address the second issue , we employ synthetic data generation techniques to create five different story-based games for each classic game. In essence, a story-based game is a contextual framing counterpart of its corresponding classic game, sharing the same structure but differing in context  (Lore & Heydari,  2023 ) . To ensure high-quality data synthesis, we introduce two additional steps: topic control and human inspection. We first define a set of topics commonly associated with cooperation and competition, such as business and law, to guide the data generation process. Then, to ensure that the synthesized games meet the required game structures and are easily understandable, we conduct rigorous human inspection ( 2.3 ).  To address the third issue , we propose three forms for expanding and organizing games: sequential, parallel, and nested. Using the above constructed games as atomic units, we reorganize them into these complex forms to assess the strategic reasoning of LLMs. The sequential and parallel forms evaluate the models capacity for sequential and parallel decision-making, respectively, while the nested form explores the LLMs multi-layered strategic reasoning abilities ( 2.4 ).",
            "TMGBench  is a benchmark designed to evaluate the strategic reasoning capabilities of LLMs in game-theoretic scenarios, illustrated by Figure  2 . It comprehensively covers 144 types of games (see  2.2 ), with each type containing multiple instances (in each instance, there are two players and each player can choose between two strategies, resulting in four possible situations), which can be categorized into classic and story-based settings. Notably, the story-based instances are produced using synthetic data generation techniques and are grounded in real-life themes, effectively mitigating the issue of data leakage (see  2.3 ). Furthermore, each game in  TMGBench  can be treated as an atomic unit, and multiple atomic games can be structured in a more complex task with parallel, sequential, or nested form (see  2.4 ). These complex scenarios effectively facilitate the evaluation of advanced LLMs abilities in parallel, sequential, and multi-layered decision-making. To precisely evaluate the reasoning abilities of LLMs, we use their performance in inferring the optimal strategy combination, i.e., the Nash equilibrium, as the evaluation criterion. Additionally, the designed evaluation metrics provide a fine-grained assessment of the robustness and self-consistency of LLMs strategic reasoning abilities (see  2.5 ).",

            "To evaluate LLMs strategic reasoning abilities with more constraints, we treat the aforementioned individual games as atomic games and expand them in three forms: sequential, parallel, and nested. The organization of these forms is illustrated in Figure  2 . Specifically, in the  sequential form , we randomly sample multiple games from the story-based games, requiring the LLM to make decisions sequentially. Only if the LLM provides correct answers for all games is it considered to have made correct decisions. In the  parallel form , the LLM is given multiple randomly sampled games and must make decisions simultaneously. Similarly, the LLM is deemed to have made correct decisions only if it solves all games correctly. In the  nested form , we randomly sample two games, designated as the  pre-game  and the  core-game , where the  core-game  holds greater importance. The decisions made by the LLM in the  pre-game  affect the strategy space in the  core-game . Thus, the LLM is judged to have made correct decisions only if it demonstrates forward-looking reasoning by choosing a sub-optimal solution in the  pre-game  to achieve the optimal solution in the  core-game . We demonstrate a template to generate an nested form game in Appendix  D.3 .",
            "As explained in Section  2.2 , our benchmark are perfectly suitable to display in a 12x12 square table, each grid representing one of the 144 equivalence classes. In the evaluation process we conduct  repetitive  tests in every data point of each equivalence class. Each test starts with the input of the setting (classic/story-based) and the question, and ends with LLMs response containing a list of choices corresponding to multiple choices or no choice (when the given list is empty).",
            "This insight motivated us to apply FoToM prompting to LLMs, representing the  F irst- o rder  T heory- o f- M ind thinking, to aid in solving these tasks. As seen in Table  2 , top-tier models like gpt-4o show improvement in both 0-tasks and 1-tasks when utilizing FoToM. Model claude-3-5-sonnet improves on 1-tasks and 2-tasks, and gpt-4o-mini displays a significant surge in performance on 1-tasks and so does Llama-3.1-70B on 2-tasks. However, for models like Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen2-72B, FoToM does not seem to provide any prominent advantage and may even result in worse performance. Notably, no LLM achieves overall improvement across all task categories by merely using first-order ToM, and 0-tasks appear to be the most challenging for LLMs to solve.",
            "Furthermore, we wondered if LLMs display some ability to use first-order ToM could also be capable of second-order ToM. According to  Liddle & Nettle ( 2006 ) , higher-order ToMs are generally more difficult to master than first-order ToM. Thus we selected only advanced models that demonstrated proficiency in first-order ToM to attempt solving specific tasks using  S econd- o rder  T heory- o f- M ind (SoToM) prompting. As seen in Table  2 , models like gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini and claude-3-5-sonnet show consistent performance when applying second-order ToM to tasks they are already capable of solving better with first-order ToM. However, the improvements from using SoToM generally do not exceed those achieved with first-order ToM. In addition, Llama-3.1-70Bs underperformance with SoToM suggests that possessing first-order ToM capabilities does not necessarily imply proficiency with second-order ToM. The prompts used for FoToM and SoToM are provided in Appendix  C.2 .",

To verify that  TMGBench  can be extended to harder tasks which may better align with complicated scenarios from the reality, we run the test on the three complex forms we mention in Section  2.4 , to assess the performance of two strongest LLMs (o1-mini and gpt-4o) in complex strategic reasoning.",
