            "Figure  1  shows the overview of MIRAGE consisting of two components. To imitate the human decision-making process, a trajectory history encoder learns from the sequences of events using a recurrent neural network. Afterward, based on the output hidden states of the trajectory history encoder, a probabilistic event decoder generates the probability distributions for the next event time, activity categories, and locations in a cascading manner, where the latter distribution depends on the samples drawn from the former distribution. Notably, the distribution of the next event time is modeled using an intensity-free TPP, while the distribution of the next location is modeled by a neural EPR model. In addition, we also use a Variational Autoencoder to model the distribution of individual preferences on trajectory (User VAE).",

We observe that MIRAGE consistently achieves the best performance with the lowest JSD, yielding 59.0%, 68.9%, and 71.5% improvement (reduction on JSD) over the best-performing baselines on TKY, IST, and NYC datasets, respectively. However, even though we selected four similarity metrics covering three different aspects of spatial (Distance and Radius), temporal (Interval), and user (DailyLoc) distributions, these metrics cannot fully reflect the ultimate utility of generated trajectories in supporting downstream tasks. For example, the consistent superiority of MIRAGE over baselines on these similarity metrics is still biased, because MIRAGE indeed underperforms some baselines in a few cases in our task-based evaluation, as we discuss below.",

Second, MIRAGE outperforms MIRAGE-noEPR in most cases, with an improvement of 50.3% and 19.2% on similarities and task-based evaluation, respectively, which verifies the usefulness of our neural EPR model. In addition, to further show the utility of the EPR model, we plot the empirical returning probability of users over time, which is defined as the probability of a user returning to a location a certain period (temporal distance) after the users first presence at the location  (Gonzalez et al . ,  2008 ; Yang et al . ,  2020a ) . Figure  2  shows the plots of both real and generated data on NYC. We see that the real trajectory exhibits strong periodicity, which can be well imitated by MIRAGE but not by MIRAGE-noEPR. The plots for baselines are also available in Appendix  I . The superiority of MIRAGE is also validated on the return probability over sequence lengths in Appendix  J ."
