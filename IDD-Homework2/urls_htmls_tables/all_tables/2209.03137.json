            "The initial goal of Federated Learning is to carry out useful machine learning methods in multiple devices, and build an aggregated model based on dataset across multiple devices, while ensuring users‚Äô privacy and security [37]. Thus, we should obey the original goal of federated (transfer) learning. Although they are not chosen by us, we briefly review some other alternative for security and privacy in machine learning (see Table 3.1) for completeness.",
            "MM-SADA. Similar to MDANN, fine-grained action recognition is also an application of multimodal domain adaptation. Munro et al.¬†[49] propose Multi-Modal Self-Supervised Adversarial Domain Adaptation (MM-SADA) to address the inevitable domain shift problem, which training a model in one environment and then deploying it in another leads to performance degradation. In addition to domain adaptation, i.e. adversarial alignment, Munro et al.¬†also leverage the correspondence of modalities as a self-supervised alignment method for Unsupervised Learning [49]. More specifically, they use self-supervision technique between different modalities in one sample, and domain adaptation (adversarial alignment) is used in the same modality [49]. Experiment results show MM-SADA outperforms other unsupervised domain adaptation methods.",

Ericsson et al.¬†[22] analyze the effectiveness of Self-Supervised Learning with comparison between Supervised Learning and Self-Supervised Learning. There is no best pre-trained Self-Supervised model is suitable for all downstream tasks, the best self-supervised methods can surpass supervised differs from Supervised Learning in terms of the information representations. If the downstream tasks perform on recognition tasks, the performance is seriously correlated. However, when the datasets are irrelevant to recognition, the correlation exists little.",
            "Combination \\@slowromancapiii@. The third combination approach is that a fusion approach is used to connect all the modalities N1subscriptùëÅ1N_{1} and N2subscriptùëÅ2N_{2} in P1subscriptùëÉ1P_{1}, namely co-training sub-networks of their modalities, and then transfer N1subscriptùëÅ1N_{1} in P2subscriptùëÉ2P_{2}. The representative approaches of multimodal domain adaptation, including MDANN [63], MM-SADA [49], ADA [46], DLMM [42], PMC [80], and JADA [43], give us a hint to transfer after co-training sub-networks. However, multimodal domain adaptation approaches apply transferring between two multimodal datasets to solve domain shift problem. Domain adaptation approach in Federated Transfer Learning [32] give us a direction that all participants can learn a common discriminative information to do better transferring. Besides domain adaptation, Contrastive Learning (Self-Supervised Learning) have the advantages of both co-training sub-networks and learning discriminative information. AVC [2], AVE-Net [3], CrossCLR [83], AVID [52], LWTNet [1], CBT [66], CSTNet [36] give us support to learn fused feature representations and keep the matching information at same time (see Table 3.4).",
            "We choose Contrastive Learning as our Transfer Learning strategy. From the related work of Contrastive Learning, AVC [2] is the first paper using Contrastive Learning with an image-audio dataset. AVC applies contrastive loss to learn matching between different modalities. The contrastive loss of AVC is similar as it in SimCLR [13], which is calculated after fusing different modalities. AVE-Net [3] goes one step further based on AVC. This step is embedding [3], which is used to extract features after fusing. However, the authors in CrossCLR [83] analyzed that the embeddings ignore the inter-similarities between modalities. Thus, we choose the contrastive loss function in SimCLR to learn representative features from multimodal data. (refer to Table 3.4)\n",

In total, 45 video sources have been processed, and they are at 29.97 frames per second and then reduced to 2000 seconds. Each frame (at 0.5s, 1.5s, 2.5s ‚Ä¶ and so on) of a video is extracted as a image, at the same time, each MFCC [48] audio statistic is also extracted from corresponding second of video. These 9 environmental classes are in the table 5.1. All the videos are captured in the nature environment. In order to make better distinction between different classes and obtain better recognition results, it is necessary to crop the image at each second to obtain the initial data objects. As it is shown in Figure 5.1, each frame of video and each piece of audio are extracted in pairs. Thus, 32,000 recognizable objects and 17,252 RGB images pairwise with 17,252 seconds of audio [7].",

            "Combination \\@slowromancapiii@. The third combination approach is that a fusion approach is used to connect all the modalities N1subscriptùëÅ1N_{1} and N2subscriptùëÅ2N_{2} in P1subscriptùëÉ1P_{1}, namely co-training sub-networks of their modalities, and then transfer N1subscriptùëÅ1N_{1} in P2subscriptùëÉ2P_{2}. The representative approaches of multimodal domain adaptation, including MDANN [63], MM-SADA [49], ADA [46], DLMM [42], PMC [80], and JADA [43], give us a hint to transfer after co-training sub-networks. However, multimodal domain adaptation approaches apply transferring between two multimodal datasets to solve domain shift problem. Domain adaptation approach in Federated Transfer Learning [32] give us a direction that all participants can learn a common discriminative information to do better transferring. Besides domain adaptation, Contrastive Learning (Self-Supervised Learning) have the advantages of both co-training sub-networks and learning discriminative information. AVC [2], AVE-Net [3], CrossCLR [83], AVID [52], LWTNet [1], CBT [66], CSTNet [36] give us support to learn fused feature representations and keep the matching information at same time (see Table 3.4).",
            "We choose Contrastive Learning as our Transfer Learning strategy. From the related work of Contrastive Learning, AVC [2] is the first paper using Contrastive Learning with an image-audio dataset. AVC applies contrastive loss to learn matching between different modalities. The contrastive loss of AVC is similar as it in SimCLR [13], which is calculated after fusing different modalities. AVE-Net [3] goes one step further based on AVC. This step is embedding [3], which is used to extract features after fusing. However, the authors in CrossCLR [83] analyzed that the embeddings ignore the inter-similarities between modalities. Thus, we choose the contrastive loss function in SimCLR to learn representative features from multimodal data. (refer to Table 3.4)\n"
