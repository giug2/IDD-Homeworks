            "We decode the shared latent representation using a convolutional network into tissue property maps by passing its output through the exponential function, ensuring that the property values are greater than zero, and transforming the resulting values by the signal model ( Equation 1 ) to reconstruct the input. Following previous work  [ 20 ,  18 ] , we combine an L2 reconstruction loss with a perceptual loss, a patch-wise adversarial loss, and a KL-regularization loss on the latent distribution.",
            "We evaluated the impact of the encoder conditioning via adaptive group normalization and the prior on T1 and T2 on the reconstruction performance of our VAE model measured by the mean squared error (MSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), the multi-scale structural similarity index (MS-SSIM), and the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). The results in  Table 1  show that encoder conditioning improves the models performance in the majority, whereas the prior improves its performance in all cases."
