The dataset comprises two disjoint parts: one ranked by a group of labelers for model-generated responses, and the other written by users to summarize the key content of a post. We use the former to compute the consistency between the selector and the human annotator. For the latter, we apply various metrics, including best-of-n𝑛n, rating, and win rate.

This phenomenon, known as reward hacking, is discussed by Skalse et al.

However, we can mitigate this impact by delaying the inflection point, allowing the reward proxy model to continue improving performance for more training rounds and ultimately achieve a higher rating.",

Therefore, FedBiscuit adopts a new aggregation rule as formulated in Equation (8).",

The dataset comprises two disjoint parts: one ranked by a group of labelers for model-generated responses, and the other written by users to summarize the key content of a post.

The results are presented in Table 1 and Figure 3.",

As a result, our dataset may lack the depth and breadth necessary to fully comprehend the true heterogeneity of preferences among clients. Without access to authentic client data, we may inadvertently overlook important variations in preferences, potentially limiting the applicability and robustness of our findings.",

This is because the selectors of FedBiscuit are trained for 100 rounds only, while the selector of FedBis has been fully trained for 200 rounds. When the inflection point appears in FedBis, we can hypothesize that the dominance of FedBiscuit still exists.",

            "Previous works offer a number of human preference datasets, but none of them address the FL setting. This is the first work to discuss the possible data partition approaches to build a heterogeneous human preference dataset. To this end, we introduce a benchmark that includes several human preference datasets suitable for FL.",
            "RLHF typically involves supervised fine-tuning, reward modeling, and reward optimization, initially popularized by Christiano et al. (2017). Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) Schulman et al. (2017) is a common RLHF algorithm, yet it struggles with instability, inefficiency, and high resource demands Choshen et al. (2019); Engstrom et al. (2020). These challenges have led to the development of alternative methods, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) Rafailov et al. (2023) and others Dong et al. (2023); Zhao et al. (2023); Azar et al. (2024); Ethayarajh et al. (2024); Gulcehre et al. (2023), which offer more stable and efficient solutions. However, these methods typically operate within a centralized training framework, where the LLM owner retains control over the preference data. In contrast, our work seeks to expand data sources and incorporate real user preferences during the fine-tuning of the LLM.",
            "As demonstrated in experiments, FedBis’s performance improves first but may later decline with the increase of training rounds. This phenomenon, known as reward hacking, is discussed by Skalse et al. (2022) as an inevitable issue in training a reward proxy model, which is used to enhance the performance of a policy model (e.g., LLM). However, we can mitigate this impact by delaying the inflection point, allowing the reward proxy model to continue improving performance for more training rounds and ultimately achieve a higher rating.",
            "It is noted that performance degradation occurs when a model is trained by clients with time-varying sizes in FedAvg Gu et al. (2021); Wang and Ji (2023). In other words, Equation (4) is no longer suitable for multi-selector aggregation due to the fluctuation in the number of clients training a selector in each communication round. Therefore, FedBiscuit adopts a new aggregation rule as formulated in Equation (8).",
            "In this section, the evaluation data originates from the TL;DR dataset, as mentioned in Section 5. The dataset comprises two disjoint parts: one ranked by a group of labelers for model-generated responses, and the other written by users to summarize the key content of a post. We use the former to compute the consistency between the selector and the human annotator. For the latter, we apply various metrics, including best-of-n𝑛n, rating, and win rate. The results are presented in Table 1 and Figure 3.",
            "The table shows that conventional centralized training outperforms the proposed FedBiscuit in terms of agreement. This is because the agreement evaluation data have a similar distribution to the training dataset, as their outputs are generated from the same language models and labeled by the same group of labelers Stiennon et al. (2020). Consequently, centralized training performs better than the proposed FedBis and FedBiscuit, which are affected by data heterogeneity.",
            "One notable limitation of our work lies in the construction of the preference dataset, which relies solely on publicly available data rather than gathering information directly from real clients. By doing so, we miss out on the nuances and intricacies of individual preferences that can only be captured through firsthand data collection. As a result, our dataset may lack the depth and breadth necessary to fully comprehend the true heterogeneity of preferences among clients. Without access to authentic client data, we may inadvertently overlook important variations in preferences, potentially limiting the applicability and robustness of our findings.",
            "The table above may lead to conclusions different from those drawn from the summarization task. First, FedBis achieves better performance than FedBiscuit. This is within our expectations. First, these selectors are trained for a total of 200 rounds. As presented in Figure 3, FedBiscuit surpasses FedBis after 300 communication rounds. This is because the selectors of FedBiscuit are trained for 100 rounds only, while the selector of FedBis has been fully trained for 200 rounds. When the inflection point appears in FedBis, we can hypothesize that the dominance of FedBiscuit still exists.",
            "Another comparison arises between different numbers of generations to a given prompt. From the table, we notice that \"2-completion\" can achieve better performance than \"4-completion,\" meaning that the performance may not be relevant to the size of the RLFT training set. Instead, it may rely on the quality of the training data. As we can see, Alpaca-7B hardly generates high-quality data, leading to limited improvement with training with these generated data. In other words, if we generate more low-quality completions, the improvement of the model would be more limited.
