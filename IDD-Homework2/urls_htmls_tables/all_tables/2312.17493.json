            "The surge in interest and application of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a drive to fine-tune these models to suit specific applications, such as finance and medical science. However, concerns regarding data privacy have emerged, especially when multiple stakeholders aim to collaboratively enhance LLMs using sensitive data. In this scenario, federated learning becomes a natural choice, allowing decentralized fine-tuning without exposing raw data to central servers. Motivated by this, we investigate how data privacy can be ensured in LLM fine-tuning through practical federated learning approaches, enabling secure contributions from multiple parties to enhance LLMs. Yet, challenges arise: 1) despite avoiding raw data exposure, there is a risk of inferring sensitive information from model outputs, and 2) federated learning for LLMs incurs notable communication overhead. To address these challenges, this article introduces DP-LoRA, a novel federated learning algorithm tailored for LLMs. DP-LoRA preserves data privacy by employing a Gaussian mechanism that adds noise in weight updates, maintaining individual data privacy while facilitating collaborative model training. Moreover, DP-LoRA optimizes communication efficiency via low-rank adaptation, minimizing the transmission of updated weights during distributed training. The experimental results across medical, financial, and general datasets using various LLMs demonstrate that DP-LoRA effectively ensures strict privacy constraints while minimizing communication overhead.",
            "However, accomplishing the aforementioned objective presents non-trivial challenges. Firstly, despite federated learning ensuring no direct exposure to raw data, there remains a risk for attackers to potentially deduce training data from model outputs. This vulnerability arises because LLMs can accidentally disclose sensitive information through their responses (Carlini et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023a). For instance, reports indicate that malicious adversaries could exploit the New Bing to link victims’ personally identifiable information using partial information (Li et al., 2023b). Secondly, naively applying federated learning to fine-tune LLMs can trigger significant communication overhead. This is because model updates from diverse decentralized sources need iterative aggregation, and frequent transmission of these updates for a complex model like LLM is extremely expensive. Despite strategies to mitigate communication challenges in federated learning (Konečnỳ et al., 2016; Hamer et al., 2020; Lan et al., 2023), a notable trade-off persists: while these methods alleviate communication bottlenecks, they cannot ensure concrete guarantees in protecting the privacy of the training data.",
            "One notable trend is the general decrease in performance across all models with stricter privacy settings (lower ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon and higher δ𝛿\\delta values). For instance, GPT-2’s performance on MedQuAD drops from 69.2 at the original setting to 55.3 and 49.1 when ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon is reduced to 2 and δ𝛿\\delta to 1​e−051𝑒051e-05, respectively (Tables 3 and 7). This trend indicates a trade-off between privacy and utilities.",
            "In contrast, some models like Llama-7B show a more resilient performance under varying ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon values. For example, its performance on LiveQA only marginally decreases from 69.4 to 66.1 when ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon is increased from the original to 10 (Table 6). This suggests that certain models might be better suited for privacy-sensitive applications.",
            "Additionally, the impact of changing δ𝛿\\delta values appears to be more model-specific. Bert’s performance on MEDIQA-Ans decreases significantly from 73.3 in the original setting to 57.4 when δ𝛿\\delta is reduced to 1​e−061𝑒061e-06 (Table 8), highlighting a potentially higher sensitivity to δ𝛿\\delta adjustments.",

            "GPT-2 (Table 19) showed a performance drop in BoolQ from 61.9 to 33.5, PIQA from 56.9 to 46.3, and WinoGrande from 48.9 to 39.4 as the rank reduced from origin to 32, alongside an increase in compression ratio from 45.5 to 79.5. BERT (Table 20) exhibited a similar performance decline, for example, in WinoGrande from 60.2 to 37.8, with a compression improvement from 42.0 to 75.5. Llama-7B (Table 21), a larger model, maintained a relatively stable performance (e.g., BoolQ at 76.3 to 39.1, WinoGrande 70.0 to 67.8 ) despite significant parameter reduction (compression ratio from 7.31 to 36.27). In contrast, ChatGLM-6B (Table 22) showed a more pronounced performance degradation (BoolQ dropping from 69.5 to 50.1, WinoGrande from 71.3 to 46.3) with a notable decrease in parameters (compression ratio moving from 7.6 to 47.4). These results highlight the variability in how different models respond to parameter reduction and compression, underscoring the challenge of balancing communication efficiency with performance in federated learning environments."
