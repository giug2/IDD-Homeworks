            "As shown in Figure 3, the FedBN model with fine-tuning performs the best on the in-federation internal validation set as well the out-of-federation BTCV test set. The SegViz framework using FedBN with fine-tuning segmented the BTCV test set with dice scores of 0.93, 0.83, 0.55, and 0.75 for segmentation of liver, spleen, pancreas, and kidneys, respectively, significantly (p<0.05𝑝0.05p<0.05) better (except spleen) than the dice scores of 0.87, 0.83, 0.42, and 0.48 for the baseline models. In contrast, the central aggregation model performed significantly (p<0.05𝑝0.05p<0.05) poorly on the test dataset with dice scores of 0.65, 0, 0.55, and 0.68. We note that the model trained on the centrally aggregated data did not generalize to the spleen label due to the overall model becoming biased toward the liver and pancreas labels, which contain more samples per label. We have included the statistical t-test results between the baseline and the best-performing models in Table 1 and Table 2."
