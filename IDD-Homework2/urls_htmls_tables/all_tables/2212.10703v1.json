The PINN approach is about 5x faster than the FDFD approach when overlapping boundary conditions are used and 10x faster when we donâ€™t use overlapping boundary conditions. Furthermore, the overlapping boundary method is more memory efficient, and thus useful for running inverse design on machines with low RAM.",
