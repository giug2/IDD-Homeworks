When the client only has the embedding layer like FedBert model, F−1superscript𝐹1F^{-1} is a single Transformer block, the attack model can achieve a BLEU-4 score of 28.570 and a ROUGE-1 score of 33.290, while in the FL-GLM framework, where the client contains the embedding layer and an LLM-Block, F−1superscript𝐹1F^{-1} is a single layer Transfomer, all the metrics of the attack model are all close to 0. Therefore, the security of FL-GLM could be proven in experiments. Additionally, we find that the attack metrics’ performance of a single-block Transformer is similar to that of a multi-block Transformer. Therefore, the optimal split point, based on experimental results, might be a single-block Transformer, even though it is challenging to prove theoretically."
