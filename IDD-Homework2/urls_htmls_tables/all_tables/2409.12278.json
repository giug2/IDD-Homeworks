            "In this work, we show how to induce large language models to behave like world models. As depicted in  Figure 1 , a world model must perform two functions. (1) It must determine action applicability. We must be able to answer the question: can this action be performed at this time? (2) If the action is applicable, a world model must be able to answer the question: how the world is different if it were to be performed? This is equivalent to asking what state I will be in? We fine-tune two LLMs, one that predicts the preconditions of an action, and another that predicts the effects of an action. We provide a means for these two models to work together, along with procedures for checking preconditions against a world state and applying effects to alter the world state, thus fully replicating the functionality of a world model. We also provide a method for using LLMs to generate synthetic data with which to fine-tune the above two models.",
            "Specifically, our world model consists of two main sub-modules: a precondition/effect inference module ( 3.1 ) and a semantic matching module ( 3.2 ). The world model performs valid action prediction and state transition prediction by invoking these two modules ( 3.3 ).",
            "We perform multi-faceted evaluations of our world model. Specifically, we evaluate the following three things: ( 4.1 ) the effectiveness of the global-local prompting technique in creating a high-quality action precondition/effect corpus, ( 4.2 ) the effectiveness of the precondition/effect inference module in making accurate precondition/effect predictions, and ( 4.3 ) the effectiveness of the world model (precondition/effect inference module and semantic matching module working together) in making accurate valid action predictions and state transition predictions. We choose dish cooking as the domain to evaluate as it is a representative real-world domain example in which there is significant dependency among different actions.",
            "Since the empirical performance of the precondition/effect inference module is dependent on how good the training data is, we thereby perform ablation studies to investigate how the key steps (global and local step discard) in creating the corpus may impact the precondition/effect inference performance, and also to confirm the key steps necessity by making performance comparison between the full version and the ablated versions. Specifically, we study the following two ablations: training inference modules on the corpus created by the global-local prompting technique while skipping (1) steps #2 and #4 (denoted as Ablation-Local) or (2) step #5 (denoted as Ablation-Global). Results presented in  Table 1  show that the precondition/effect inference modules trained on our high-quality corpus can make accurate predictions that are very consistent with the ground truth. The performance comparison between the full version and the ablated versions demonstrates that both global and local step discard are necessary and beneficial for creating a high-quality corpus that LLMs can further learn from to make reliable action precondition/effect inferences."

            "For each of the two prediction tasks, we maintain a 200-sample holdout test set respectively. For valid action prediction, we balance the test set by equalizing the number of valid and invalid action samples, and use the prediction accuracy (Acc.) as the evaluation metric. For state transition prediction, we follow an existing evaluation setup  Ammanabrolu and Riedl ( 2021a )  by combining the state addition and deletion as the final prediction and using the metrics introduced in  subsection 4.2  (F1, BLEU-2/3, ROUGE-L, and SMS) to measure the performance. Results presented in  Table 2  show that on both tasks our world model can make accurate predictions consistent with the ground truth. We perform similar ablation studies as  subsection 4.2  on Ablation-Local and Ablation-Global, and the results demonstrate that both global and local step discard are necessary and beneficial for establishing a capable world model. For state transition prediction, we also do a similar human evaluation as  subsection 4.2  to evaluate our world model more comprehensively. On 30 randomly selected samples, we find that with a moderate average inter-annotator agreement, 63% of the predicted state transitions are consistent with humans commonsense understanding and reasoning of the real world."
